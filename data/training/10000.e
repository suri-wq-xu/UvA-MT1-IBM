speech FROM THE THRONE 
the Speaker : 
honourable Members of the Senate , 
members of the House of Commons , 
ladies and Gentlemen : 
it is an honour for me , today , to open this Second Session of the Thirty - Sixth Parliament of Canada . 
i am very aware of the sacrifices that so many of you make in your personal and professional lives in accepting the challenges of public office . 
the commitment you have made is one that I share , and I look forward to working with you over the next five years in the service of the people of Canada . 
today , the representatives of the Canadian people gather to open the session of Parliament that will carry the country into the new millennium . 
we stand before a new century confident in the promise of Canada for our children and grandchildren . 
technology is altering every aspect of our lives . 
knowledge and creativity are now the driving force in a new economy . 
and collaboration is becoming more essential as the issues facing our diverse society grow in their complexity . 
but Canadians will succeed in this changing world , just as we have succeeded throughout our country ' s history . 
the promise of Canada was born in an age when countries were forged through war or revolution . 
our nation ' s founders chose a unique path , which has become the Canadian way - creating a country dedicated to peace , order and good government for all its citizens . 
it took foresight and commitment to break the mould of the nation - state founded on a single language , culture or religion . 
that foresight and commitment have been greatly rewarded . 
canada began as a small colony with little industry and no role of its own in global affairs . 
over generations , individual Canadians built a better future for their families and their communities . 
Canadians and their governments overcame barriers of distance and a harsh northern climate to build a national railway , a system of highways , a postal service , and national cultural institutions , as well as hospitals , universities , and other institutions . 
Canadians and their governments also put in place a modern social safety net . 
together , these achievements have provided the foundation for our quality of life . 
within a few generations , we evolved into an independent nation with an advanced industrialized economy and a voice in the councils of the world : the United Nations , the G - 8 , the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development , NATO , and many others . 
but whenever tyranny has threatened peace and security , Canadians have never hesitated to answer the call . 
together with our proud Canadian veterans , we remember those who paid with their lives at Vimy Ridge , on Juno Beach , and at Hill 355 in Korea . 
in the tradition of the coureurs des bois , we have explored the frontiers of science . 
from the invention of newsprint to the creation of advanced computer languages , Canadian ingenuity has helped to build the information age . 
from the discovery of insulin to the earliest pacemaker , Canadians have given new life to millions around the world . 
canada was a pioneer in the peaceful use of space , becoming a leader in satellite communications and remote - sensing technologies . 
today , our astronauts are using Canadian technology to help assemble the International Space Station - the largest scientific project in history . 
in a complex world , diverse approaches , skills and ideas are essential to building a higher quality of life . 
canada is a bilingual country in which both men and women of many different cultures , races and religions participate in economic , social and political life . 
our diversity is a source of strength and creativity , making us modern and forward - looking . 
our actions and our history make us at home in a world of change and increasing interdependence . 
our human talent , our values and our commitment to working together will secure Canada ' s leadership in the knowledge - based economy . 
today , Canadians can look with pride on Canada ' s success . 
we have a dynamic economy , a strong and democratic society , and a sense of community . 
we are recognized throughout the world for our quality of life . 
we will build a higher quality of life for all Canadians - for our children , ourselves , and our neighbours . 
a Strong and United Canada 
a high quality of life for Canadians and a strong , united Canada are inseparable . 
the Government will continue to take a comprehensive approach to strengthening the unity of our country . 
all its actions will serve to strengthen Canada by enhancing the quality of life of Canadians . 
our federal system allows us to value the different strengths of each region of our country . 
it guarantees all citizens equal rights and freedoms . 
and it enables Canada ' s wealth to be shared by all citizens no matter where they live - from Newfoundland in the east , to British Columbia in the west , to our newest territory , Nunavut , in the north . 
over the last two Parliaments , Canadians have built a foundation for even greater success . 
our artists , writers , musicians and filmmakers draw admiration from around the world . 
and Canada itself earns the respect of the community of nations as a symbol of peace , democracy and compassion . 
the best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians . 
but there are some who would pull us apart rather than bring us together . 
even though Quebeckers do not want a third referendum , the Government of Quebec continues to talk about holding another one . 
the Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians that the principle of clarity , as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada , will be respected . 
this requires national will , national strategies and partnerships across the country . 
citizens and governments must collaboratively build an even stronger and more united Canada , a Canada that remains an example to the world . 
Canadians expect their national government to focus on areas where it can and must make a difference . 
and they want this done in the Canadian way - working together , balancing individual and government action , and listening to citizens . 
Canadians expect their Government to be fiscally prudent , to reduce the debt burden , to cut taxes , and to pursue the policies necessary for a strong society . 
the emerging global marketplace offers an enormous opportunity to create more Canadian jobs , more Canadian growth and more Canadian influence in the world . 
achieving a higher quality of life requires a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the transition to the knowledge - based economy , promote our interests and project our values in the world . 
together , we will strive for excellence . 
this demands that we collaborate with our partners to : 
develop our children and youth , our leaders for the 21 st century ; 
build a dynamic economy ; 
strengthen health and quality care for Canadians ; 
ensure the quality of our environment ; 
build stronger communities ; 
strengthen the relationship with Canada ' s Aboriginal peoples ; and 
advance Canada ' s place in the world . 
our Children 
because of the changing nature of the world economy , the prospects for a high quality of life in any country will depend - as never before - on having a population that is adaptable , resilient and ready to learn throughout life . 
the foundation for this is laid in the very early years . 
no commitment we make today will be more important for the long - term prosperity and well - being of our society than the commitment to invest our efforts in very young children . 
parents and families have the primary responsibility for the care of their children . 
but all of society must work together to ensure that our children develop the abilities to succeed . 
the Government will extend and make more accessible Employment Insurance benefits for parental leave , to help parents take more time from work to spend with their children . 
it will make its own workplace policies and those of federally regulated employers more family friendly . 
through further tax relief , it will put more dollars in the hands of families with children . 
and , with its provincial and territorial partners , it will work to reform family law and strengthen supports provided to families to ensure that , in cases of separation or divorce , the needs and best interests of children come first . 
federal , provincial and territorial governments are developing together the National Children ' s Agenda . 
as part of this work , it is the Government ' s objective to reach an agreement among governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further support parents and families . 
this plan will be consistent with the Social Union Framework Agreement . 
it will set out common principles , objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments to increase resources and further strengthen supports for early childhood development . 
to make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty , the federal , provincial and territorial governments also established the National Child Benefit . 
the Government of Canada is already investing an additional $ 1.7 billion annually in low - income families with children , while the provinces and territories are investing in complementary services . 
the Government wants no family to have to choose between a job and benefits for their children . 
therefore , by 2002 , the Government will make a third significant investment in the National Child Benefit , while seeking a commitment from its provincial and territorial partners to increase their investment in services for families with children . 
young Canadians 
young Canadians are the leaders of tomorrow . 
already , they are at home in the wired world . 
they have energy , ideas and technological savvy , and they want to contribute to building their country in the 21 st century . 
in our global and connected world , young Canadians are acquiring knowledge and skills at an earlier age . 
the Government will focus on providing young people with more opportunities to connect to the Canadian experience , to view their country in all its splendour , to gain a first - hand understanding of the different regions , and to be challenged by what they learn from their fellow citizens across this land . 
the Government will : 
draw on the expertise of young Canadians to help connect rural and urban communities to the information highway , by hiring them to put in place additional Internet access sites for public use ; 
create a single - window service - Exchanges Canada - to give 100,000 young Canadians every year the chance to learn about another part of the country ; 
ensure that younger Canadians - from age 13 - are given an opportunity to apply their creative abilities , by providing them with a chance to produce their " first works " using traditional approaches and new technologies in the arts , cultural , digital and other industries ; 
actively engage tens of thousands of young Canadian volunteers to participate in community and national environmental projects and to help others improve their literacy skills ; and 
enable young Canadians to apply their energy and talents overseas , by participating in international internship programs and helping developing countries get connected to the Internet . 
in addition , the Government will continue to place a priority on providing young Canadians with career information , access to work experience , and learning opportunities . 
a Dynamic Economy for the 21 st Century 
in the global , knowledge - based economy , the advantage goes to countries that are innovative , have high levels of productivity , quickly adopt the latest technology , invest in skills development for their citizens , and seek out new opportunities around the world . 
Canadians have built a strong and dynamic economy . 
it is the cornerstone of our quality of life - providing Canada with the means to continue building a more equitable society , a healthier population , and stronger communities . 
in the space of only a few years , our nation ' s finances have gone from deficits and debt to balanced budgets , with low inflation and low interest rates . 
laws and regulations have been modernized and the role of government in business decisions has been reduced . 
the Government will continue to build a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden , cutting taxes , and making strategic investments . 
such investments will help small businesses grow , encourage trade , support citizens in developing the skills they need , and ensure that Canada has modern infrastructure . 
the Government is committed to prudent fiscal management . 
it will never let the nation ' s finances get out of control again . 
it will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track . 
it will deliver on the commitment it made at the beginning of this Parliament to devote half the budget surplus to debt repayment and tax relief , and the other half to investments that address the social and economic needs of Canadians . 
tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the growth and wealth which enable those public and private investments necessary for a high quality of life . 
in its next budget , the Government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reduction . 
increased Trade and Investment 
canada ' s economy is more open than any of the leading industrialized countries . 
we are blessed with a population that comes from countries all over the world . 
foreign markets for our goods and services provide us with new opportunities . 
foreign investment provides us with capital , new ideas , new technologies , and innovative business practices . 
to build on Canada ' s advantage , the Government will increase its trade promotion in strategic sectors with high export potential - sectors ranging from biotechnology and environmental and information technology to tourism , culture and health . 
it will also continue to support innovation and the development of new technologies in leading export sectors such as agriculture , agri - food and natural resources . 
it will launch Investment Team Canada - a co - ordinated effort by all governments and the private sector to make the international community more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth in Canada . 
the Government will also modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada . 
in addition , the Government will work with its partners in the hemisphere toward the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005 . 
skills and Knowledge for the 21 st Century 
a skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are crucial building blocks of a successful 21 st century economy . 
over the last three years , the Government has put in place a strategy to build on Canada ' s advantage as the country with the most highly educated workforce in the world . 
it has made it easier to save for a child ' s education . 
it will make college and university more affordable through Canada Millennium Scholarships . 
it has improved student debt relief and provided better tax assistance to finance lifelong learning . 
we will continue to build on this strategy . 
the Government will forge partnerships with other governments , public - and private - sector organizations , and Canadian men and women to establish a national action plan on skills and learning for the 21 st century . 
this plan will focus on lifelong learning , address the challenge of poor literacy among adults , and provide citizens with the information they need to make good decisions about developing their skills . 
over the next two years , the Government will work with its partners to : 
make it easier for Canadians to finance lifelong learning ; and 
provide a single window to Canada - wide information about labour markets , skills requirements and training opportunities - on the Internet , over the telephone or in person in communities across the country . 
to ensure that the Public Service of Canada remains a strong , representative , professional and non - partisan national institution that provides Canadians the highest quality service into the 21 st century , the Government will also focus on the recruitment , retention and continuous learning of a skilled federal workforce . 
infrastructure for the 21 st Century 
achieving this objective will require new types of infrastructure . 
knowledge Infrastructure 
improving Canada ' s knowledge infrastructure means supporting a new generation of leaders , attracting the best researchers , and encouraging our graduates to put their talents to work here at home . 
the Government will introduce the legislation necessary to create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research . 
these institutes will provide a model for world - leading research , bringing together for the first time all the researchers who have an impact on health to undertake shared research priorities . 
this innovative approach recognizes the importance of collaborative research for improving the health and well - being of Canadians and for building a high - quality health system . 
the Government of Canada has for many years been one of the most important contributors to research at Canadian universities . 
in the last two years , the Government has pursued an ambitious agenda to improve its support for advanced research in Canada . 
to build on this agenda , the Government will : 
increase its support to the Granting Councils , enabling them to forge new partnerships with our universities to attract the best research minds in the world through an innovative program of 21 st Century Chairs for Research Excellence ; 
foster greater international research collaboration by Canadian universities and institutes and expand Canadian expertise in such areas as genomics , climate change , and advanced engineering ; and 
find new markets for new products and services developed through research by universities and government research centres . 
the Government will also ensure that it has a modern and effective research and science capacity to promote the health , safety and economic well - being of Canadians . 
information Infrastructure 
improving Canada ' s information infrastructure will support the exchange of ideas and the conduct of business over computer networks , connect Canadians to the information highway , and accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce . 
the Government will : 
take steps to make Canada a centre of excellence for electronic commerce and encourage its use throughout the economy ; 
re - introduce legislation to protect personal and business information in the digital world and to recognize electronic signatures ; and 
the Government will become a model user of information technology and the Internet . 
we will build on a pilot project now under way to make www . access . ca 
our knowledge - based economy is more than high - tech companies . 
it is an economy in which all sectors strive to use leading technologies and processes . 
it is an economy in which clusters of technology development already exist in smaller communities all over Canada . 
indeed , it is an economy in which technology can lead to greater economic stability for the primarily rural regions in which cyclical resource industries - agriculture , fisheries , forestry , mining and tourism - are the dominant sources of wealth . 
the Government will encourage the development and adoption of new technologies in all sectors . 
cultural Infrastructure 
the strength of Canada is reflected in its rich diversity . 
across this country , Canada ' s culture comes alive through our writers , singers and performers , through our filmmakers and artists , and through those who chronicle our history and preserve our heritage . 
it will put collections from the National Archives , National Library and other key institutions on - line . 
physical Infrastructure 
canada must also continue to improve its physical infrastructure for the 21 st century . 
to increase trade and economic growth , we must ensure that we have the capacity to move people and goods safely and efficiently . 
to maintain the quality of life in our cities and rural communities , we must ensure that we have clean air and water . 
the Government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach - by the end of the year 2000 - agreement on a five - year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country . 
health and Quality Care for Canadians 
good health and quality care are essential to the well - being of all Canadians and are part of our strength in today ' s global marketplace . 
advances in technology , research and information are opening tremendous new opportunities for improving the health and well - being of citizens . 
Canadians expect their governments to work together to ensure that Canada ' s health care system is modern and sustainable . 
the Government recently reaffirmed its commitment to medicare by investing an additional $ 11.5 billion to modernize the health system for the beginning of the 21 st century . 
the Government will continue to move forward with its provincial and territorial partners and the health care community on common priorities . 
with its partners , the Government will support the testing of innovations in integrated service delivery in areas such as home care and pharmacare , working toward a health system in which all parts operate seamlessly . 
a modern health information system will give health professionals and individual citizens improved access to up - to - date information about health issues and treatment options . 
the Government will ensure that citizens in every region of the country have access to such information so they can make better - informed decisions . 
the Government will protect the health of Canadians by strengthening Canada ' s food safety program , by taking further action on environmental health issues , including the potential health risks presented by pesticides , and by modernizing overall health protection for a changing world . 
we will also continue to address the serious health problems in Aboriginal communities , supporting their efforts to promote wellness and to strengthen the delivery of health services . 
the Quality of Our Environment 
the long - term economic and social well - being of every Canadian depends on the state of our natural environment . 
canada ' s ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be part of Canada ' s strength in the 21 st century . 
Canadians have long recognized the underlying relationship between a healthy environment and a high quality of life . 
Canadians and leading businesses are already working in their own communities to preserve the natural environment , pushing the frontiers and opportunities of environmental technologies and new eco - efficient practices . 
the quality of the environment in our communities is also linked to the environmental health of other communities around the world . 
problems such as climate change and dangerous levels of persistent toxins can be resolved only through concerted international action . 
within Canada , the Government will work with other governments and citizens to meet our country ' s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
it will set and enforce tough pollution standards , in particular to better protect the health of children , seniors and residents of the North . 
it will place greater emphasis on sustainable development in government decision making . 
it will also address the structural weaknesses that have been identified in the management of toxic substances . 
internationally , Canada will provide technical assistance to developing countries in adopting sustainable practices . 
the Government will introduce legislation and stewardship programs , working with provinces and territories to ensure that species at risk and their critical natural habitat are protected . 
the Government will also continue to extend Canada ' s national parks system . 
in its own operations , the Government will make itself a model of environmental excellence . 
it will do more to clean up contaminated federal sites . 
it will strengthen its capacity for conducting environmental science research . 
it will also explore new environmental clean - up technologies . 
the Government will report regularly on the results achieved in addressing the top environmental concerns of Canadians . 
building Stronger Communities 
working Together 
our history has been one of Canadians helping Canadians to seize opportunities and rise to challenges . 
this commitment to working together - by Canadians , their governments and their communities - will ensure Canada ' s continued success in addressing the complex issues of the 21 st century . 
it also commits governments to eliminating barriers that unjustifiably impede the mobility of citizens within Canada . 
these barriers include rules that prevent some citizens from obtaining recognition of their qualifications when they move to another province , that deny some students use of their student loans when they study out - of - province , and that restrict access to essential services for some citizens - including those with disabilities - because of their province of origin . 
the Government of Canada is committed to working together with its partners to meet the deadlines set out in the Social Union Framework Agreement , thereby removing all unjustifiable barriers to mobility no later than 2002 . 
in 2001 , Canadians will mark the International Year of Volunteers - a time to celebrate the achievements of Canada ' s everyday heroes . 
the Government recognizes the need to build partnerships with communities and to renew its relationship with the voluntary organizations that serve and sustain them . 
the Government will enter into a national accord with the voluntary sector , laying a new foundation for active partnership with voluntary organizations in the service of Canadians . 
strong communities depend on the participation of all their members . 
to this end , the Government will pursue its efforts with other governments , the private and voluntary sectors , and all citizens to build communities in which Canadians with disabilities are fully included and in which new Canadians feel more at home . 
in addition , the Government will continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the root causes of homelessness and help communities respond to their members ' needs for shelter and other support . 
promoting Safer Communities 
Canadians are justifiably proud of having built communities where citizens feel safe . 
this is a key component of our quality of life and a contributor to Canada ' s comparative advantage . 
the Government will work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe . 
its focus will be balanced , combining prevention and a community - centred approach with action to deal with serious crime . 
it will expand the community - based crime prevention strategy and re - introduce legislation to reform the youth justice system . 
the Government will combat drug trafficking while helping communities aid those most affected . 
it will also launch a program of restorative justice to help victims overcome the trauma of crime and provide non - violent offenders with a chance to help repair the damage caused by their actions . 
the Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats to Canadians and their neighbours around the world . 
it will work to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global in scope , including money laundering , terrorism , and the smuggling of people , drugs and guns . 
the Government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP and other agencies to address threats to public security in Canada and work with enforcement agencies in other countries . 
in addition , it will work to modernize legislation to better ensure public security . 
the Government of Canada will also continue to work closely with the Government of the United States to modernize our shared border for the 21 st century . 
a Stronger Relationship with Canada ' s Aboriginal Peoples 
the contribution of Canada ' s Aboriginal peoples has shaped our country ' s heritage and will continue to enrich Canada in the new century . 
the Government will continue to build on the strong foundation of reconciliation and renewal created by Gathering Strength - Canada ' s Aboriginal Action Plan . 
we are now building stronger partnerships with Aboriginal people - concentrating on improving their living conditions and , increasingly , on strengthening their economies . 
as a result , Aboriginal people will be able to more fully participate in and contribute to Canada ' s economic development and social well - being . 
fostering good government and strong accountability in First Nations communities will increase investor confidence , support economic partnerships , and improve living conditions . 
land claim agreements , in particular , are essential to create certainty for Aboriginal people and their surrounding communities - providing the climate needed for partnerships , investments and economic opportunities . 
early in the new session of Parliament , the Government will introduce legislation to implement the historic agreement with the Nisga ' a . 
canada ' s Place in the World 
as we move into the 21 st century , Canada has the momentum to lead the way toward a safer and more secure world . 
Canadians have built the highest quality of life in the world by focussing on the needs of people . 
we have the expertise to advance an agenda of human security - protecting people from threats to their rights , their safety and their lives . 
we have a reputation internationally for making a difference - through our contribution to eliminating landmines , our work with NATO and the United Nations in Kosovo , our development assistance to Asia and Africa , our efforts to establish the International Criminal Court , and our work to renew the international financial system . 
Canadians recognize that their quality of life depends in part on the quality of life of their neighbours - those who share this planet with us . 
a world where people are secure is a world where fewer people are forced to flee their homes , where there is less crime and terrorism , and where there is a reduced threat of disease and pollution . 
the Government will give increased prominence to human security in its foreign policy , working to achieve meaningful progress in the councils of the world on a global human security agenda . 
in 2001 , the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on children . 
in the spirit of partnership that led to the historic treaty banning landmines , the Government will work to reach key international agreements to protect the rights of children . 
canada will champion efforts to eliminate the exploitation of children , including the use of child soldiers in armed conflict , and will help address the crisis of children affected by the HIV / AIDS epidemic . 
the Government will act with like - minded countries to reform and strengthen international institutions such as the United Nations , International Monetary Fund , World Bank and World Trade Organization . 
it will also work to develop a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world . 
to advance Canada ' s leadership in the Arctic region , the Government will outline a foreign policy for the North that enhances co - operation , helps protect the environment , promotes trade and investment , and supports the security of the region ' s people . 
the Government will increase international development assistance and work in innovative ways to enable poor countries to improve the quality of life of their citizens . 
the Government will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Forces have the capacity to support Canada ' s role in building a more secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and security in foreign lands . 
honouring Canada ' s Promise for the 21 st Century 
as we prepare to celebrate the turn of the millennium , we can look to our past with pride and to our future with confidence . 
like previous generations , we will face new challenges . 
but guided by our values and our collective experience , we can ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world in which to live - the best place to raise children , to learn , to pursue opportunity , to share in rich , diverse and safe communities , and to admire the beauty of nature . 
all Canadians - every citizen , every government , every business and every community organization - have a part to play . 
we will build the 21 st century together .

( motion agreed to ) 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
address IN REPLY 
the House proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered by Her Excellency the Governor General at the opening of the session . 
Mr. Rick Limoges ( Windsor - St. 
Mr. Speaker , it is with a profound sense honour and humility that I move the motion , seconded by the hon. member for Laval West , on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
i would like to pay my respects to Her Excellency the Governor General and thank her for delivering the speech to both Houses . 
i offer the governor general my sincere congratulations on her historic appointment and wish her much success in the years ahead . 
i would also like to thank the Right Hon. Prime Minister and the government for the honour conferred on me , the recently elected member of parliament for the riding of Windsor - St. 
as hon. members know , earlier this year I succeeded my friend and hon. members ' former colleague , the late Shaughnessy Cohen . 
Shaughnessy had a heart of gold and an infectious personality . 
she served her constituents well and I intend to be just as enthusiastic as she was in representing the interests of my constituents . 
the riding of Windsor - St. 
they are hard working people who play by the rules , raise their families and care deeply about their community and their country . 
proof of this can be seen in the fact that for the last 30 years the Windsor - Essex county area has led the country in per capita donations to the United Way . 
the tremendous sense of pride and community I see every day in Windsor and Tecumseh is what makes serving as their member of parliament so meaningful to me . 
along with numerous other localities in Canada , Windsor - St. 
Clair has an active and vibrant francophone community to which I am proud to belong . 
my parents , and their parents before them , were aware of the importance of preserving their language and culture and equally aware of the challenge involved . 
i face that same challenge every day , as do my children . 
our government has done much to enshrine the rights of francophone Canadians from sea to sea . 
Windsor is proud of its heritage as Canada ' s car capital . 
Windsor is equally proud to be the home of Hiram Walker , producers of the famous Canadian Club whisky . 
Windsor ' s long - established industries are doing very well under our government , but the city has progressed beyond its traditional industrial base of assembly and manufacturing plants . 
the Windsor casino , with its 20,000 - plus visitors daily , has become Canada ' s number one tourist attraction . 
among its positive economic effects are the thousands of well paid jobs it has created , and the millions of dollars in new revenue to the provincial government , in large part from U.S. visitors . 
Windsor ' s economy is changing in other ways as well . 
for example , aided by our government ' s investment in technological and skills development Windsor is now the tool and mould capital of the world . 
our city is home to well over 100 high tech design firms using state of the art computers , machines and robotics . 
industrial leaders in our community such as Tony Toldo , the Rodzik family , Michael Soltz and Steve Reko are demonstrating Canada ' s leadership in quality manufacturing , industrial design and research . 
during our government ' s time in office there has been considerable corporate investment in Windsor . 
the big three automakers , General Motors , Ford and Daimler - Chrysler , have all made significant investments to the lasting benefit of Windsor and Canada . 
the centre is using state of the art computer assisted design and telecommunications technology . 
such investments are a clear demonstration of confidence in Canada ' s economy and an acknowledgement that Canadian workers are highly skilled , well educated and efficient . 
it also reflects a great degree of confidence in our government and our Prime Minister . 
of course , coming from Windsor I have very large shoes to fill . 
Paul Martin Sr . , Eugene Whelan and Mark MacGuigan served in government with great distinction as very effective representatives of their fellow citizens . 
my colleague , the member of parliament for Windsor West , the Deputy Prime Minister , has not only served our part of the country throughout his long and distinguished career , he has worked on behalf of all Canadians . 
they instilled in their children the importance of making a meaningful contribution to our community and the world around us . 
that is why I spent 14 years on city council in Windsor prior to joining members here . 
when I decided to run for parliament it was because I wanted to help Canadians realize their dreams . 
i wanted to help build on the accomplishments of this government . 
in my previous career in the banking industry I had many opportunities to help people realize their dreams . 
i worked with men and women who were applying for student loans , loans for their first cars , mortgages for their first homes or starting new businesses . 
i helped people invest their life savings and plan for their retirement years . 
i listened to their dreams and their plans for the future . 
i also remember when Canadians were uncertain about the future , insecure about their jobs or unable to find one . 
i remember when there was a huge budget deficit , high interest rates and a ballooning national debt . 
most of us seriously doubted that the nation ' s pension plan would be there for us when our turn came to retire . 
there was little talk about dreams and the future and more about just making it to the end of the week . 
that was six years ago . 
the leadership and balanced approach of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have meant that this government has been able to accomplish many things . 
over the years the government has introduced major tax cuts , eliminated the deficit and begun to reduce the national debt . 
our government is investing in priorities such as health care , education and technological innovation to prepare Canada for the 21 st century . 
today the unemployment rate in Windsor is a mere half of what it was in 1993 and the local economy is very strong . 
now when I run into my former clients they are again talking about their dreams . 
they have renewed hope for the future . 
canada is now experiencing the longest stretch of economic growth since the 1960 s . 
in the last budget , we announced $ 7.7 billion in tax cuts over a three year period , and the tax cuts of $ 16.5 billion announced in our last two budgets will benefit all taxpayers . 
in fact , 600,000 low income Canadians will pay absolutely no federal income tax . 
we have brought down a second balanced , surplus budget . 
we have proposed a tax plan of four consecutive balanced , surplus budgets . 
this is only the third time since Confederation that such a feat has been accomplished . 
as part of the Canadian equal opportunity strategy , we announced an additional investment of over $ 500 million for the purpose of creating Canadian institutes for health research . 
this is a record of commitment , a record of achievement , a record in which our government can take pride . 
it is a testament to the vision and the leadership of our Prime Minister . 
more important , this is a record that has improved the life of every Canadian . 
there is still much more that remains to be done . 
we must continue to reduce the tax burden on Canadians in a meaningful and responsible manner . 
we must continue to reduce the national debt and we must continue to foster a climate where entrepreneurs can succeed , where we reward talent and hard work , and where Canadians can be confident in their economic future . 
at the same time we must build on the strengths of our national health care system and take steps to modernize it so that it is ready for the challenges of the 21 st century . 
we must provide families with the support framework they need to ensure that Canada ' s children , our children , get the best possible start in life . 
working with provinces and territories , we have opened a new front in the war on child poverty with the creation of the national child benefit system , the most important new social program since medicare . 
it takes an innovative national approach to helping low income families with children . 
the Government of Canada ' s contribution to the national child benefit system is the Canada child tax benefit , CCTB . 
we have pledged to increase the CCTB by $ 2 billion by Canada Day 2000 . 
this means a family earning $ 20,000 with two children will get over $ 3,700 through the CCTB . 
we must invest in higher learning and scientific research to secure our place in a knowledge based economy . 
this year Canada became the first country in the world to connect every public school and every public library to the Internet . 
these are an enormous hit with parents saving for their children ' s future education . 
over 300,000 new RESP accounts have been opened since the new grant was announced last year . 
since we must act in all these areas , I am pleased to see that the Speech from the Throne proposes a proactive agenda . 
the last throne speech of the 20 th century is truly an action plan that sets the foundations for a promising future . 
as a federal member of parliament , one of my priorities is to try to improve our national roadway system , because it is critical to the quality of life of all Canadians . 
our roads are used to transport the products we sell and the food we eat to Canadian cities and towns . 
the roadway system is the backbone of our tourist industry and the lifeline of our foreign trade . 
Clair we are the victims of cross border pollution in addition to what we ourselves add to the mix . 
in recent years Canadians have become increasingly aware of all types of pollution . 
while many industries are working to clean up their act , like the Ford Motor Company attaining ISO 14001 certification in our local plants , citizens are worried that individuals in the various levels of government are neglecting their environmental responsibilities . 
getting to know our new Minister of the Environment has given me a renewed sense of confidence in our ability to make real progress . 
that message is also reinforced in a vision expressed in the Speech from the Throne . 
one of the best ways to succeed is to support the development of clean technologies . 
for example , this spring Daimler - Chrysler revealed the first zero emission fuel cell car in North America . 
the Ballard fuel cell is Canadian technology that is also being successfully tested in mass transit . 
such a development could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
in closing I leave the House with this thought . 
in the last election Canadians chose our government to lead the nation into the 21 st century . 
canada has been recognized for six straight years by the UN as the best country in the world in which to live . 
with our government ' s inspiring vision for the future unveiled earlier today we have indicated that we are ready for the new millennium . 
together we can build a society that strikes the right balance between economic investment and respect for the environment , the right balance between support for innovation and support for our cultural diversity . 
with a balanced approach we can build a society where every Canadian has a place and where we all share the rewards . 
together we can ensure that Canada remains the best country in the world in which to invest , to learn , to work and to live in the 21 st century . 
in doing so we will strengthen Canadians ' sense of pride and belonging to this vast , diverse and beautiful nation , a nation woven from caring communities like my own . 
i hereby move , seconded by the hon. member for Laval West , that the following address be presented to Her Excellency the Governor General of Canada : 
to Her Excellency the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson , a member of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada , Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada , Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit , Governor General and Commander - in - Chief of Canada . 
may it please Your Excellency : 
we , Her Majesty ' s most loyal and dutiful subjects , the House of Commons of Canada , in parliament assembled , beg leave to offer our humble thanks for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both houses of parliament . 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a great honour for me to second the motion for the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
as their elected representative I will continue to work with my colleagues as well as with the private sector and NGOs to meet the challenges of the new millenium , which were outlined in the Speech from the Throne . 
the riding of Laval West Quebec , is very representative of the population of both Quebec and Canada . 
it is home to Canadians of various origins , mostly francophone , but there are also many anglophones and Canadians of Greek , Portuguese , Armenian , Lebanese , Egyptian , West Indian , Jewish and other origins . 
the riding has a major rural component , depending mainly on horticulture , and a very urban component , namely the great city of Laval . 
there are low , middle and high income families . 
it is a community that works hard together and , like Canada as a whole , finds a way to affirm its diversity in unity . 
Laval is the second largest city in Quebec . 
since its inception its activities have shifted toward the secondary sector , without eliminating all of its primary sector . 
in the past 15 years Laval ' s focus has been on high tech and the industrial , commercial and financial sectors . 
the priorities set by our government in the throne speech are completely in line with the expectations and priorities of the families in Laval : a prosperous and healthy society . 
children are the foundation of the society of tomorrow . 
the more attention we focus on the children of today in their early years , the better their future and our future will be . 
dozens of community and not for profit organizations are already involved every day in helping low and middle income families . 
our government intends to adopt a positive and responsible attitude to bring hope to the families of Laval , the families of Canada . 
while I was listening to Her Excellency reading the Speech from the Throne , something kept crossing my mind . 
i believe that every member of this House , above and beyond any differences of opinion , was thinking exactly the same thing : the progress this country has made in the past six years , the work that has been accomplished by all Canadians , is truly remarkable . 
in a nutshell , Canada was on the verge of bankruptcy , and something drastic definitely needed to be done . 
this government was therefore elected with the mandate of remedying the situation . 
Canadians realized this was going to mean some difficult years and numerous sacrifices , but they also realized they could count on us to listen to them , to work along with them , to make the necessary choices , keeping in mind their values and their priorities . 
we had the confidence of Canadians and we knew that we could have confidence in them as well . 
let us look at what we have become today : a country of over 30 million people , with unemployment at its lowest level in ten years . 
the era of budget deficits is behind us . 
with inflation and interest rates under control , many Canadians are now able to buy a house and start a family without having to worry about going deep into debt . 
Canadians are also seeing their tax bill drop . 
the news in the throne speech is that their net income will rise in the years ahead . 
aware that running a country is more than an exercise in accounting , our government has done all this . 
balancing a budget is not an end in itself and neither is lowering taxes . 
rather , these are ways of bringing about a vision , our vision , the vision of all Canadians for a strong , united , and prosperous Canada with a quality of life unequalled anywhere else in the world , a Canada whose successes know no limitations . 
while some would have us live in the past , this government has always had its eye on the future , on the future of this country and on the future of every single Canadian , and the future begins with families and children . 
it begins by giving every young Canadian a chance to succeed in the new knowledge based economy and build a better quality of life . 
this government has no higher priority . 
that is why over the last few years we placed the cornerstones of the national children ' s agenda with a special focus on the problems of low income families with children . 
along with our partners we have made considerable progress so far . 
we created the national child benefit through which low income families receive in total $ 1.7 billion every year while provinces and territories are reinvesting in complementary services . 
our government has already pledged new funds that will bring the total to $ 2 billion a year by July 2000 . 
and that is not all . 
as we speak , hundreds of projects to help children and parents are under way in communities across Canada with the assistance of federal programs , projects that benefit from programs such as aboriginal head starts which were recently expanded to include children who live on reserves , the Canadian prenatal nutrition program which funds community groups that counsel and help women at risk of having unhealthy babies , the community action program for children which funds community groups that assist in meeting the developmental needs of at risk children from birth to age six . 
we did all this as we were fighting to bring the nation ' s finances under control . 
imagine what we will be able to do now . 
our government has committed to increasing resources for early childhood development , providing targeted assistance for low income families with children and fostering family friendly workplaces . 
we will continue to work with our partners , the provinces and the territories , to further improve community support for early childhood development . 
we will continue to invest in the national child benefit . 
we will continue to put more money in the hands of families through further tax relief . 
we will give parents the freedom to spend more time with their children . 
we will implement workplace policies that are more favourable to families and we will modernize family law with an eye to placing the needs of children first . 
this is not all that our government has done to help children . 
in recent years we have also introduced the Canadian opportunities strategy to provide Canadians with easier and more affordable access to education and training . 
we have established the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation and set up a $ 2.5 billion fund that will begin distributing over 100,000 scholarships a year to postsecondary students from low and middle income families starting in January . 
we have created the Canada education savings grant to help Canadians invest in their children ' s future . 
we have introduced a tax credit for interest payments on student loans . 
in addition , we have implemented other programs , the benefits of which will continue to be felt for years to come : the youth employment strategy , SchoolNet , a program promoting community access to the Internet , and the computers for schools program . 
the Speech from the Throne clearly indicated that we will be building on these sound foundations in the years to come , that we will be relying on the modern infrastructure currently being put in place , not only to improve the skills and prospects of young Canadians , but also to help them to better know their fellow Canadians from other regions and our society , which is one of diversity within unity . 
we took office at a time when major changes were taking place . 
these changes , which include globalization , the rapid emergence of new technologies and their application in all areas of the economy , have a growing impact on the daily lives of Canadians . 
Canadians had every reason to be concerned . 
not only was our country at the mercy of events , but the government had very limited means to start the process of catching up . 
the burdens of the past were preventing us from moving toward the future . 
today ' s throne speech is indicative of a complete turnaround . 
we never let go of our values . 
we never listened to those who wanted us to take the easy way out . 
we took advantage of the solidarity and determination of Canadians and we marched together toward our common objective , which is to make Canada a country with a future , a country constantly striving for ever greater success . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the official opposition I would like to extend our congratulations to Her Excellency the Governor General on both her appointment and on the presentation of her first speech from the throne . 
second , I would like to congratulate the deputy chairman and the assistant deputy chairman of committees of the whole House on their appointments . 
third , I would like to extend congratulations to the member for Windsor - St. 
Clair and the member for Laval West on their speeches in support of the government ' s legislative program . 
there are of course two sides to every story and we are looking forward to presenting the other side tomorrow . 
therefore , I move : 
that the debate be now adjourned . 
the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
that the House do now adjourn . 
the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
the Speaker : 
this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
( the House adjourned at 4.45 p.m. ) 
her Excellency 
the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson 
governor General of Canada 
installation Speech 
the Senate 
Thursday , October 7 , 1999 
prime Minister , 
you have expressed to me the affection , loyalty and esteem of the Canadian people , which it will be my honour to convey to our gracious sovereign , Queen Elizabeth II. 
i am pleased to accept the responsibility of being Her Majesty ' s representative in Canada , with all that entails , through our history and our custom . 
knowing better than anyone my own shortcomings , I undertake this task with humility and ask you all , as Canadians , to help me . 
i take on the responsibility of becoming Canada ' s 26 th Governor General since Confederation , fully conscious of the deep roots of this office , stretching back , to the Governors of New France and to the first of them , Samuel de Champlain . 
in our beloved Georgian Bay , which lies on the great water route he took from the French River to Huronia , there is a cairn , placed on a small island , between a tennis court and Champlain ' s Gas Bar & Marina , which commemorates his passage and quotes from his journal : 
Samuel de Champlain 
by canoe 
" as for me , I labour always to prepare a way for those willing to follow '' . 
those willing to follow have embodied the institution of the Governor General in ways which have demonstrated the evolution and constant reaffirmation of this country . 
canada ' s institutions have never been static . 
they are organic - evolving and growing in ways that surprise and even startle us . 
the Governor General is one skein in the woven fabric of what Eugene Forsey characterised as our " independent sovereign democracy '' . 
Champlain ' s successors have had many activists among them . 
lord Elgin , who helped Baldwin and LaFontaine to anchor the Canadian model of democracy in 1848 , stands out as somebody who appreciated the originality of a country which would promote such a project . 
he loved to wander about our few small cities , on foot , glorying in snowstorms , eschewing the formality of his office and speaking of his admiration for " this glorious country " and " its perfectly independent inhabitants '' . 
he also said , that in order to have insight into the future of all nations , it was necessary to come here . 
Vincent Massey , our first Canadian Governor General , laid the groundwork for practically all of our modern cultural institutions - the Canada Council , the National Arts Centre , the Order of Canada , among others . 
and my predecessor , Rom é o LeBlanc , reinforced the central fact of French Canada across this country , culminating in the success of last month ' s Summit that put New Brunswick and Acadia at the centre of the map of francophone reality . 
this was only fifty years after the great painter , Paul - Emile Borduas , had exhorted Quebec , and by implication , all of us , to abandon " the smooth and slippery walls of fear " by refusing " to act knowingly ( or consciously ) - beneath ( our ) psychic and physical possibilities . " 
allow me a moment of personal reflection . 
the Poy family , arriving here as refugees , in 1942 , was made up of my parents , my brother and myself . 
three of us are in this Chamber today . 
we did not arrive as part of a regular immigration procedure . 
there was no such thing for a Chinese family at that time in Canadian history . 
my mother ' s intense and abiding love is here in spirit today . 
my brother , Dr. Neville Poy , was seven when we arrived . 
and my father , Bill Poy , is here - extraordinary , in his 92 nd year . 
Lance - Corporal Poy , dispatch rider with the Hong Kong Volunteer Corps , received the Military Medal for his bravery during the battle of Hong Kong . 
like many soldiers , he never speaks of those actions , but it is his bravery , which is the underpinning of his children ' s lives . 
to have been brought up by courageous and loving parents , was a gift that made up for all we had lost . 
but it was also the place where our family was befriended by the Molots , who owned the local drugstore , the Marcottes and the Proulx , among whom we lived in Lower Town , and our guardian angels , the Potters . 
because my father had a job with the Department of Trade and Commerce and because we lived among French Canadians , I became fixated , from the age of five , with the idea of learning French . 
i remember the day when I was dressed up in my patent leather shoes and pink smocked dress , and was taken up the street by my parents to the convent of Ste. Jeanne d ' Arc , where I was interviewed by a kindly woman wearing white all around her face , while a dim crucifix glowed in the background . 
walking home , I sensed that there was dejection in the air and disappointment . 
it had been explained to my parents that it was not possible for a Protestant to receive French language education in Ottawa . 
in my lifetime , this has changed to such a radical degree that I don ' t even need to comment on it . 
but that early sense of something being impossible , which actually was nonsensical , put steel into me . 
Farley Mowat has pointed out that a little adversity in childhood is a very good thing for animals - including human ones . 
our family , like many others , had lost a great deal but we had also gained an enormous amount : a country with lakes , with small mouth bass and with free public education . 
it is a strength and not a weakness that we are a " permanently incomplete experiment built on a triangular foundation - aboriginal , francophone and anglophone '' . 
it is an old experiment , complex and , in worldly terms , largely successful . 
stumbling through darkness and racing through light , we have persisted in the creation of a Canadian civilization . 
we are constructing something different here . 
as Jean - Guy Pilon describes in one of his poems : 
À cracher au visage des é toiles . 
we have the opportunity to leave behind the useless blood calls of generations , now that we are in the new land that stretches to infinity . 
there seem to be two kinds of societies in the world today . 
perhaps there have always been only two kinds - punishing societies and forgiving societies . 
a society like Canada ' s , with its four centuries of give - and - take , compromise and acceptance , wrong - doing and redress , is basically a forgiving society . 
we try - we must try - to forgive what is past . 
the punishing society never forgets the wrongs of the past . 
the forgiving society works towards the actions of the future . 
the forgiving society enables people to behave well toward one another , to begin again , to build a society in hope and with love . 
we know , that in joining Canadian society , we will be able to accept the invitation , offered , in 1970 , by Grand Chief John Kelly : " As the years go by , the circle of the Ojibway gets bigger and bigger . 
Canadians of all colours and religions are entering that circle . 
you might feel that you have roots somewhere else , but in reality , you are right here with us . " 
that the aboriginal circle enlarges to include all of us - native and immigrant - arriving by boat and plane to a vast and beautiful land , has been characterised by Michael Ondaatje , as a " vision of nature beyond the human ego '' . 
this is a place , he said , " fixated by the preoccupying image of figures permanently travelling or portaging their past - we are all still arriving . 
from the Filles du Roy to Dionne Brand ' s new Canadians is a miniscule step '' . 
we must not forget that this complexity is whole . 
to be complex does not mean to be fragmented . 
this is the paradox and the genius of our Canadian civilization . 
in the contemplation of our wholeness , lies the symbolic importance of the Governor General : the identification of this post with inclusiveness - the inclusiveness that lies at the core of Canadian society , at its best . 
this is the essence of our notorious decency , our infamous desire to do good . 
and it is important to recall that with the great waves of immigration , there has been , since the beginning , an underlying motif : the lost , the rejected , and those who dreamed of another life would come here and would make a contribution to the whole . 
in a 1913 photograph , a group of Scandinavian immigrants in Larchmont , Ontario is huddled around a blackboard on which is written : 
duties of the Citizen 
understand our government . 
2 . Take an active part in politics . 
3 . Assist all good causes . 
4 . Lessen intemperance . 
5 . Work for others . 
it would be easy to focus obsessively on all the pitfalls and prejudices that undoubtedly landmined this path of good intentions . 
but in examining the intent , you see the underlying central assumption . 
it was expected that the immigrant , along with everyone else , would join in the social process , which was democratic , co - operative and other - directed . 
the fact that it would take another 50 years for this kind of inclusiveness to become colour blind , means , simply , that it took another 50 years . 
but in other countries , it would take a hundred . 
in some , it has never come . 
the essence of inclusiveness is that we are part of a society in which language , colour , education , sex and money need not , should not divide us , but can make us more aware and sensitive to difference . 
i learned to be a Canadian through a series of eternally virginal public school teachers , who treated me only as bright - and not bright yellow . 
they were mostly small - town Ontario women who , given some of our history might have been narrow - minded ; but without exception they had the ability to reach out and understood , instinctively , the need for compassion and the stirring of imaginative curiosity . 
luckily , all of us came to a land where the aboriginal peoples have always dreamed life into being . 
it is customary to talk about how hard immigrants work and how ambitious they are , but those of us who have lived that process , know that it is mainly the dream that counts . 
i ' m not talking here of fantasy . 
i am talking of the true dream that is caught in the web of the past as it meets the wind of the future . 
all of us have this , even if we do not express it . 
this is what gives a nation , such as ours , its resonance , its depth and its strength . 
the dream brings openness , adventure and , of course , pain and confusion . 
but , as Leonard Cohen observes , " There is a crack in everything . 
that ' s how the light gets in '' . 
through the light that is in us , we have created a place of dynamic innovation . 
innovation in political structures . 
new approaches toward social relationships , towards citizenship . 
we must not see ourselves as a small country of 30 million people , floundering in a large land mass . 
we are among the healthiest , best - educated people in the world , with great natural riches . 
we have two of the world ' s great languages . 
we must not see ourselves as people who simply react to trends but as people who can initiate them . 
we must not see ourselves as people to whom things are done but as people who do things . 
our history demonstrates that we have the self - confidence to act and to act successfully . 
we can - when we trust ourselves - seize hold of the positive energy , flowing out of the choice we have made to be here and to continue what remains an unprecedented experiment . 
the streetcar our family often took on Sunday afternoons to Rockliffe Park , used to pass the closed gates of Rideau Hall . 
i ' m so glad that has changed . 
i ' m delighted that crowds of people now come through the grounds and the Visitor Centre . 
i look forward to continuing the tradition of welcoming Canadians to what is , in effect , your national house . 
but we will not always be in Ottawa . 
John and I intend to travel and re - travel this whole country by plane , train , car , canoe and kayak . 
we are initiating the holding of a public levee in each province and territory we visit . 
you are all invited . 
in ten days we will be in Alberta for our first official provincial trip . 
our first levee will be held on Saturday , October 16 th at 4 p.m. at the Museum of the Regiments in Calgary . 
in November , we will be in British Columbia and our levee will be on Sunday , November 21 st in Vancouver . 
we want to meet as many of you as we can , not only on special occasions at Rideau Hall and at La Citadelle in Quebec City , but where you live and make your lives . 
we bring to this new work , a deep commitment to the relationship between francophone and anglophone , which is the essential and central fact of our political history . 
we have already long - established , personal interests in French immersion schooling , shelter for the fragile in our society and human rights . 
and I am committed , as I have always been , to affirming and furthering the full expression of that more than half of society to which I belong - a group which modestly calls itself women . 
we also have a history of deep involvement in and love for the arts. 
beauty and excellence are not the property of a select group . 
they are the means by which we most profoundly express our society and they belong to every one of us . 
as I take up this task , I ask you to embark on a journey with me . 
together , I hope that we will be able to do it with the Inuit quality of isuma , which is defined as an intelligence that includes knowledge of one ' s responsibility towards society . 
the Inuit believe that it can only grow in its own time ; it grows because it is nurtured . 
i pray that with God ' s help , we , as Canadians , will trace with our own lives , what Stan Rogers called " one warm line through this land , so wild and savage '' . 
and in the footsteps of Samuel de Champlain , I am willing to follow 
prime Minister of Canada 
at The Installation Ceremony of Governor General 
October 7 , 1999 
Ottawa , Ontario 
your Excellency , Madame Adrienne Clarkson . 
allow me to offer the best wishes of the Government , Parliament and people of Canada as you take the oath of office . 
i would also like to express appreciation to the Right Honourable Romeo LeBlanc and Mrs. Fowler LeBlanc . 
with quiet dignity and abiding good grace , they have left an indelible mark on this high office . 
when he took office in 1995 , this proud Canadian became the first Acadian to serve as Governor General . 
and I know that the opportunity to participate in the 8 th Summit of La Francophonie in his native New Brunswick at the end of his mandate gave him special pleasure . 
i was touched by his show of pride at the historic meeting between French President Jacques Chirac and our Acadian community . 
at the emotional way that Mr. Chirac renewed the unbreakable bond of fraternity that connects Acadians with the home of our ancestors , and praised the exemplary accomplishments of Canada . 
ladies and gentlemen , we are gathered to honour a person of singular talent , discernment and achievement . 
who today becomes the representative of our Head of State in Canada . 
whose selection as Governor General is just one more remarkable stop in an incredible personal journey . 
from this uncertain beginning , the arc of her life has taken a steady upward course . 
an arc that has run parallel with the development of the Canada we know today . 
a cosmopolitan nation . 
at home with our diversity . 
in practice as well as theory . 
her presence here today tells us how far we have come as a nation . 
a nation built by immigrants . 
by those who sought our national dream and our safe haven . 
it is not for me to tell Canadians what they already know about Madame Clarkson . 
her list of accomplishments as a journalist and commentator speaks for itself . 
but I would like to say a few words about that special quality that makes her so worthy of this office at this time in our history . 
we live in a time of globalization . 
across time - zones , borders and cultures . 
and in which we wonder what place there will be for diversity . 
what room to protect and nurture unique voices and experiences . 
as few others , Madame Clarkson has sensed the essential harmony in that distinctive blend of voices and experiences that gives Canadian culture its unique flavour . 
blessed with extraordinary insight , she has put her gifts to work creating venues of expression for our artists , musicians and writers . 
from every corner of our great land . 
from all backgrounds and walks of life . 
above all , I believe that her selection as Governor General sends a powerful message . 
one that makes clear our resolve as a nation to ensure that our voices and our stories remain a vibrant part of our shared experience . 
and a vital aspect of a strong and distinctive Canadian presence in the global village . 
one of bright dreams and dark nightmares . 
when we often had reason to wonder whether there was any hope for the world . 
for me , the success of Canada has been about proving - to ourselves and the world - that there is always hope . 
Madame Clarkson , your experiences and success fortify me in this belief . 
on behalf of all Canadians , I thank you for accepting these new responsibilities . 
and I also wish to extend my thanks and best wishes to Mr. Saul . 
i know he will be an able companion in the days to come . 
i wish you every success in the service of the best country in the world .

house OF COMMONS 
Wednesday , October 13 , 1999 
the House met at 2 p.m. 
prayers 
the Speaker : 
it is Wednesday and since it is also our first full sitting day , we will now begin by singing O Canada under the direction of the member for Wentworth - Burlington . 
[ editor ' s note : 
members sang the national anthem ] 
statements BY MEMBERS 
gasoline PRICING 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi - Baie - James - Nunavik , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in recent months , the people of Abitibi - T é miscamingue and I find the price of gasoline too high in Abitibi compared with other regions of Quebec . 
except in a national emergency , the federal government does not have jurisdiction to directly regulate the price of gasoline . 
the Canadian Constitution gives the provinces the authority to regulate prices . 
only Prince Edward Island and Quebec have taken any action in this regard , although Newfoundland announced recently that it would look at the statute provisions that would permit it to regulate the price of gas . 
other provinces preferred to rely on market forces as the most effective means of determining the appropriate prices , while retaining the incentives that contribute to innovation and cost reduction . 
the Government of Quebec has no choice : it will have to rely on the market forces and provide incentives for the people of Abitibi - T é miscamingue . 
* * * 
MENNONITES 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott ( Wanuskewin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to recognize the 125 th anniversary of Mennonites coming to Canada from Russia . 
one would be hard pressed to imagine what the province of Saskatchewan would be like if not for the hardworking , God - fearing Mennonites who chose to come to our country so many years ago . 
the positive influence of these men and women remains with us today . 
the contribution of the Mennonites to our present way of life is almost too difficult to enumerate . 
agriculture , cuisine , churches , enterprise and innovation are all areas that were influenced as this group settled and took root in the valley area north of Saskatoon , Saskatchewan . 
it is a testimony to God ' s enduring goodness that these Mennonite farmers , teachers , preachers and entrepreneurs flourished in this new land with harsh climate extremes and political uncertainties . 
i am pleased to be a descendant of the Neufeld clan and wish to extend my congratulations to all my constituents of Mennonite heritage on the occasion of this special anniversary . 
* * * 
safe COMMUNITIES COALITION 
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to recognize the achievements of the Safe Communities Coalition of Brockville and District . 
in the past three years they have worked with community partners to spread the message to local businesses and throughout the community that 100 % of accidents are preventable . 
in fact , last Tuesday I attended a luncheon where over 100 local businesses divided up $ 76,000 in rebates from the Worker Safety and Insurance Board under their Safe Communities Incentive Program . 
thanks to the coalition , Brockville is fast becoming one of the safest communities in Canada to live , work and play . 
* * * 
hockey 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , hockey is our game and we play it best . 
as we close the century it is fitting to acknowledge the game of the century , which took place 27 years ago on September 28 , 1972 . 
on that date the Canada - U.S.S.R. series , 480 minutes of nail - biting , heart - stopping hockey , was decided by only one goal with 30 seconds left in the game . 
everyone in my hometown of Sault Ste. Marie was riveted to their television sets to watch Team Canada and two of its favourite sons , Phil and Tony Esposito , who were instrumental in Team Canada ' s victory . 
in fact , it was Phil Esposito who set Henderson up for the winning goal . 
much has changed since that afternoon in 1972 but the people from my hometown will never forget this exciting series . 
there has not been one like it since . 
the Sault is very proud of Phil and Tony Esposito . 
* * * 
world POPULATION 
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 12 the Canadian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development celebrated its second anniversary with a forum in commemoration of the six billion mark of world population . 
the day of six billion is a significant milestone in the history of population growth . 
in only 12 short years the world has realized an addition of one billion people , nearly half of whom are under 25 years of age . 
every year 78 million people are added to the planet and over 95 % of this growth is in developing countries . 
this growing population of young people has yet to have the right and access to reproductive health services and information . 
the international community can address these problems which seriously impair their quality of life . 
i call upon Canada and all nations who are signatories to the Cairo Programme of Action to honour their commitment to put basic human needs of girls , men and women - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Calgary Northeast . 
* * * 
gulf WAR VETERANS 
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is time for the government to acknowledge the existence of gulf war syndrome . 
watching from the visitors ' gallery today are gulf war veterans Louise Richard , Maurice Binard and Susan Roirdon , wife of Terry Roirdon , whose death this April was officially caused by gulf war syndrome . 
captain Roirdon died in the prime of his life . 
they represent over 2,000 more infected soldiers . 
these veterans came to the Hill today to ask the government for answers . 
they deserve that much . 
they also deserve treatment . 
the Liberal government has been unwilling to acknowledge or treat gulf war illness . 
veterans are frustrated , sick and dying . 
they are tired of getting no response from the government . 
Canadian forces personnel are misdiagnosed , undiagnosed , untreated , then released from the service . 
these veterans have waged - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra .

ROBERT MUNDELL 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadian economist Robert Mundell has won the Nobel Prize for economic sciences for his analysis of exchange rates and their effect on monetary policies . 
professor Mundell graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1953 and received his Ph . D . from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956 . 
he has taught at Stanford , Johns Hopkins , McGill and Waterloo . 
in the 1960 s he published a pioneering study on the short term effects of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy . 
his theoretical constructs were studied by the European Union ' s leaders and were influential in developing plans for a single Eurocurrency . 
* * * 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , never before have the Espoirs de Laval so lived up to the hope expressed in their name . 
last week , one of the club members , Genevi è ve Jeanson , made the news with a marvelous accomplishment : two junior cycling championships within the same week . 
this is a first in road cycling in Quebec and in Canada . 
Genevi è ve ' s exceptional success is already being lauded as the sporting event of the year . 
Genevi è ve has already set her sights high for the future . 
starting next year , she will move up to the senior ranks and she has hopes of earning a spot on the Canadian team . 
this 18 - year old athlete ' s maturity , tenacity and discipline have made her a model for an entire generation of young people . 
it takes a huge amount of determination and hard work '' . 
Genevi è ve , has every right to those high hopes . 
the Sydney Olympics await her . 
we of the Bloc Quebecois tip our hats to her , and it is with the greatest of pride that we offer our congratulations and best wishes for continued success . 
* * * 
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Vaudreuil - Soulanges , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to quote Edgar Fruitier , Jean - Louis Millette , man of the theatre , relentless perfectionist and actor extraordinaire , let his audience down for the first time in his career when he made his final exit on September 29 . 
jean - Louis Millette the actor also left his mark on the culture of Quebec , through Quebec television . 
he also enjoyed a career in film where he often played seedy , disturbed or downright fiendish characters . 
when interviewed last year , Millette himself said the best way to keep death at bay was to work passionately for as long as one ' s strength and time permitted . 
we offer him this richly deserved tribute , along with our sincere condolences to his family members . 
thanks so much for all the memories , Jean - Louis Millette . 
* * * 
PAKISTAN 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the democratic government of Pakistan was overthrown by a military coup . 
in this context we must remember that Pakistan has had several military governments in the past and that its political culture is complex . 
the official opposition supports the restoration of the democratic government in Pakistan . 
the stability of Pakistan , a nuclear power since last year , is crucial to this region . 
we understand the concerns of Canadians of Pakistani descent . 
that said , Canada should not make any rash decision to impose sanctions or talk about suspending anyone from the Commonwealth . 
the blustering we heard from the foreign affairs ministers yesterday was a typical overreaction . 
we oppose sanctions and threats . 
instead , why does the government not encourage Pakistan ' s Asian neighbours , the IMF and the World Bank to put pressure on this military regime ? 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the opposition apparently did not appreciate the throne speech , which sets out the broad priorities of our government , nor did it take kindly to the government ' s interest in the quality of life of the Canadian public . 
the opposition did not like it that our government wants to give priority to maintaining a strong Canadian economy that will create jobs . 
and it was not at all pleased that our government is interested in our children . 
no matter . 
let the opposition go on with its search for identity and its in - fighting . 
in the meantime , the Liberal government will pursue its objective of improving the quality of life of all Canadians . 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the empty promises , hollow rhetoric and vague commitments in yesterday ' s throne speech were sweet nothings that Canadians have come to expect from the Liberals . 
what really cried out in this throne speech were the appalling gaps . 
we heard about a children ' s agenda that does not include children or child care . 
we heard a passing reference to homelessness , but nothing about providing affordable housing . 
we heard about the knowledge based economy , but nothing about ensuring that all Canadians have access to high quality education . 
if the Liberal government would for one moment stop the din and clatter of vague , meaningless pronouncements about nothing , what would it hear ? 
in the deafening silence that remains it might hear the real priorities of Canadians . 
* * * 
social UNION 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Liberal government announced how it was going to go about implementing the social union framework agreement : absolute spending authority in just about every sector , from early childhood to education , health , culture , and a host of other jurisdictions exclusive to Quebec . 
from now on , two instruments will underpin this increasingly unitary Canada : the Constitution , 1982 , and the social union agreement , neither of which has been approved by the National Assembly and both of which have been denounced by every premier of Quebec . 
yesterday ' s throne speech mentioned Quebec only once and then only to give it a clear warning . 
the provinces are being reduced to the level of municipalities and community groups . 
there is the federal government , which was referred to as national yesterday , and the rest . 
what part of this vision is still federal ? 
what has become of flexibility ? 
in the eyes of this government , Quebec no longer exists . 
will things be taken to their logical conclusion and the abolition , pure and simple , of the provinces proposed ? 
* * * 
parliamentary COMMITTEES 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , although parliamentary Standing Order 106 ( 2 ) states that the chair of all parliamentary committees will be selected by the members of that committee , the Globe and Mail reports that the transport minister has already chosen the MP from Hamilton West to chair the new transport committee . 
as well , the transport minister has established the agenda , which will include presentations by himself and Mr. Gerald Schwartz . 
the minister has instructed his Liberal MPs on the committee on how to vote for the chair before the committee has even met . 
this violates the spirit and the process described in Standing Order 106 ( 2 ) . 
will the minister stop interfering and just allow the transport committee to function as defined in the standing orders ? 
* * * 
national HOCKEY LEAGUE 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Saturday I was watching the Leaf game with my seven year old son , Patrick , who plays tyke hockey in Toronto . 
when a fight broke out on the ice my reaction was to change the channel . 
this is not behaviour my son nor his teammates are being taught . 
how do I explain to my children that violence and in particular fighting , both on and off the ice , is wrong when they see professional hockey players fighting on the ice ? 
fighting is illegal in Canada . 
it is a criminal offence whether it is taking place on a street corner or on an NHL rink . 
why is it then that we seem to have two standards of justice ? 
why is the NHL above the law ? 
the NHL has an obligation to put a stop to fighting . 
what kind of role models are we putting forward to the millions of Canadian boys and girls who watch and play hockey ? 
if the NHL does not step in , then the government should insist that the police and prosecutors lay criminal charges . 
fighting in the NHL is disgraceful and it has to stop for the sake of our children . 
* * * 
canada 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada is one of the great success stories of the 20 th century and British Columbia is a very important part of that success . 
our government has restored the nation ' s finances and modernized programs paving the way for sustained economic growth and job creation to build the future for Canadians . 
it is through this government ' s vision of working together that has made Canada the best place to live in the world and will continue to be in the 21 st century . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to be back for the fall session after a rather unusual summer . 
we had Tories joining the Liberals . 
we had NDP joining the Tories . 
we had Joe Clark united with Joe Clark , and Reformers were fighting each other . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition . 
Mr. Preston Manning : 
Mr. Speaker , Reformers were fighting each other , so maybe it was not that unusual after all . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
why should Canadians believe any of the promises of tax relief in the throne speech after six straight years of Liberal tax grabs ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are very happy to be back too . 
there was some movement . 
we are sorry that the Reform Party might disappear or end up as some type of not very united alternative . 
Canadians are very happy with the performance of the government . 
all Liberal members who have been in their ridings have reported to the caucus this morning that the people are extremely happy that we have no more deficit and that we have already started to reduce taxes . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
the Speaker : 
i am giving a little bit of room today but not lots and lots of room . 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we got sharper responses when we were handling the question period by ourselves . 
this summer I visited a lot of Canadians at their places of work : at factories , plants , offices and so forth . 
what these people are interested in is take home pay . 
they will not believe any promise of tax relief unless the federal government takes a smaller bite from their paycheques . 
why should Canadian workers believe any of these promises on tax relief when the federal deduction from their paycheques week after week and month after month keeps increasing rather than decreasing ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
there was a surtax of 3 % imposed by the Tories some years ago because of the deficit . 
that is no longer there . 
there are 600,000 Canadians who are not paying any more taxes because my Minister of Finance brought in some good budgets . 
we will keep doing that in a rational , reasonable and sensible way . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once before the Prime Minister promised tax relief . 
he was going to abolish , get rid of , in other words obliterate the GST . 
with a record like that and with statements like that on the record why should Canadians believe they are going to get real tax relief out of the Prime Minister ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we came here we said we were going to reduce the deficit to zero . 
they did not believe us but we did it . 
we have an agreement on that . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we clear all the rhetoric away from yesterday ' s throne speech what are we left with ? 
no tax cuts , just a commitment to spend a whole lot more . 
the stark reality is that on January 1 the first act of the government in the new millennium will be to raise payroll taxes and personal income taxes through bracket creep . 
why does the finance minister not simply admit that after all the smoke has cleared from yesterday ' s throne speech what we are left with is a big tax hike on January 1 ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can assure the hon. member that on January 1 , as indeed on January 1 of every year since we have taken office , there will be a reduction in payroll taxes . 
it is a perspective that says we will invest in education , we will invest in social programs , and that - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , maybe the finance minister should invest in a watch . 
he has taken up a lot of time . 
we are looking at a finance minister who has a great future behind him . 
instead , he raised taxes 60 times . 
his whole record is a record of tax hikes . 
why does the finance minister not just give it up ? 
why does he not admit that his real agenda is to raise taxes in the next budget ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have told the member a million times not to exaggerate . 
this is a question of credibility . 
the fact is that the Reform Party has no credibility . 
its tax plan in the third year would require a surplus of $ 52 billion . 
that is smoke and mirrors . 
until such time as the Reform Party gives the Canadian people a plan that is based on solid facts it will have no credibility in this debate . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is invoking the social union agreement to justify its forays into provincial jurisdictions . 
it has announced that it will establish a national children ' s agenda , evaluate the effectiveness of social programs , and eliminate unjustified barriers to the mobility of citizens and students . 
let us not forget , however , that this agreement was never signed by Quebec . 
are we to understand that the government intends to impose these new programs without Quebec ' s consent , once again demonstrating the one - sided nature of its flexible federalism ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is forgetting something , because the Government of Quebec went along with the national child benefit . 
it agreed to take the resulting surpluses and reinvest them , because we were investing in families . 
that is what it did and we had its consent . 
we are working with the provinces , although I am well aware that this does not serve the interests of the Bloc Quebecois . 
but since what we are doing is good , as was the case with the national child benefit , the Government of Quebec has had to continue working with us . 
we are going to keep on tackling real problems , particularly those having to do with children . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have the leader of this government to thank for the two instruments driving federal policy : unilateral patriation , in 1982 , and the social union agreement , both opposed by federalists and sovereignists alike in the Quebec National Assembly . 
in the same vein , the government announced that it planned to establish a pharmacare plan . 
but Quebec already has such a plan . 
are we to understand that the only choice open to Quebec will be either to amend its plan , or to forgo the money from the federal program , some of which also belongs to Quebec taxpayers ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
this is how a federation operates . 
it is still the best form of government in the world . 
as President Clinton said last Friday , federalism is always the best solution in a modern society . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Speech from the Throne the government has committed to eliminating the barriers it claims impede the mobility of citizens within Canada . 
we are aware of the tensions that exist between Ontario and Quebec in the area of construction . 
can the Prime Minister tell us whether this desire of the government to eliminate barriers to mobility means that it wishes to interfere in the discussions currently under way between Quebec and Ontario relating to construction ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is a dialogue at the present time between the Government of Quebec and the Government of Ontario relating to protectionism in the field of construction . 
i believe there should be an agreement to enable people to work anywhere in Canada that there is work , and to prevent excessive protectionism , which is detrimental to economic growth in any part of Canada . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is getting into a particularly hot issue as far as Quebec construction workers are concerned . 
perhaps he should think twice about doing so . 
in another area of concern to us , again in connection with barriers to mobility , does the Prime Minister consider that the provisions of Law 101 relating to the language of work in Quebec constitute an obstacle to mobility ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is the problem . 
i deal with federal problems . 
living here in Ottawa , I have had the opportunity to see that there are far more Quebecers working in Ontario than there are Ontarians working in Quebec .

agriculture 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is a crisis on the farm and the government does not care . 
forty - six per cent of prairie grain and oilseed producers could be out of business this time next year if the government does not act . 
our farmers are as efficient as any in the world , but the government has destroyed crucial agricultural support . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
why was the throne speech silent on the greatest , most serious farm crisis since the Great Depression ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has been working on the problem for a long time . 
we put $ 900 million aside in the last budget for resolving this problem . 
this was long before the summer . 
at this time the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food is communicating with his counterparts in Manitoba and Saskatchewan . The solution to this problem will come from both levels of government working together . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , being in communication is not exactly a solution . 
yesterday the Speech from the Throne was supposed to be about children , yet today children on the prairies are watching their farm families and farm communities fall apart . 
there was not even a mention in the throne speech . 
can the Prime Minister explain to these children why they do not count ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we had a Speech from the Throne where the main item was the future of children in Canada . 
it is a very big preoccupation for the government . 
probably she did not read the same Speech from the Throne as the minister of finance of British Columbia who said " I would give it seven or eight out of ten ; I think the spirit is right in most areas '' . 
thank you for the compliment we received from the NDP .

fisheries 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the 1990 Sparrow decision giving natives the right to conduct a food fishery should have sent warning bells when Donald Marshall Jr. appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada to fight his conviction for illegal fishing . 
given the Marshall decision and the ample time the government has had to study all possible scenarios coming out of the supreme court ruling , can the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans explain why his department was so ill prepared to respond to the supreme court ruling ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on the contrary , we have acted in a very expeditious manner . 
we believe in dialogue and co - operation . 
that is what works . 
it has paid off . 
it is working . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the reason that the native fishing issue has escalated so dramatically is that the minister ' s department had no plan regarding the court ruling , no ideas , and exercised none of the leadership that the minister should have been exercising . 
can the minister now explain why DFO was caught so off guard ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
that is co - operation and that is dialogue . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech yesterday did not even address the serious racial conflict which has erupted in the New Brunswick lobster fishery . 
ethnic tensions have escalated and that is inexcusable for the government . 
who was that ? 
it was the current Prime Minister speaking in 1969 . 
why , 30 years later , is he still ranking Canadians according to their bloodlines ? 
why would that be ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be clear . 
we have a different position from the Reform Party . 
the Reform Party believes that if everybody is treated the same , it means everybody is treated equally . 
i have three children . 
i treat them equally but I do not treat them the same . 
as a country we were built taking into consideration the regional differences across the country . 
we want to make sure we include Canadians and take into consideration the needs of Canadians right across the country . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what part of equal might the minister not understand ? 
let us take a quote from the great guru of Liberal wisdom , and that would be Pierre Trudeau where in 1969 he said : 
that was a Liberal . 
i would like to ask the Prime Minister what has changed his mind since then ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was there and there is some - 
miss Deborah Grey : 
Mr. Speaker , he said it in 1969 . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
Mr. Speaker , yes . 
in 1760 there was a royal proclamation that gave the national government an obligation to respect the treaties with the people who were here before the white people came . 
this is a treaty . 
this is a contract . 
a government has to respect obligations that were signed either yesterday or 300 years ago .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the minister suspended the Competition Act , the airline industry has been in crisis . 
yet nowhere in the throne speech is there any mention of the serious problem facing the industry , particularly in Quebec , where thousands of jobs are at stake . 
will the government tell us why it has absolutely nothing to say in the throne speech on this topic , when this is something that actually comes under its jurisdiction ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously , there were problems with Canada ' s airline industry , particularly with the weak opposition from Canadian Airlines . 
as a government , we have three options : first , we can provide financial assistance for Canadian ; second , the company can declare bankruptcy ; third , we can seek another solution . 
we have chosen the third option , which is to find a private sector solution , and that is why we resorted to section 47 of the National Transportation Act . 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , everyone is waiting to hear something about the strategic issue of the airline industry in Canada . 
why has the government chosen to remain silent about this in the throne speech , when it has found something to say about all sorts of matters that are none of its business ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in our view , the situation is very serious and I am therefore prepared to answer questions in the House of Commons . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government had months to develop a response to the Marshall decision and it did not . 
it had years to develop a fisheries management policy for this country and it has not . 
under this Liberal government Canada now has a race based fisheries policy from coast to coast . 
a fisherman ' s livelihood is contingent upon his parent ' s bloodlines . 
i would like to ask the minister why he has allowed race to become a cornerstone of fisheries policy in this country . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said earlier , clearly we have a different point of view on this side . 
our view on aboriginals is that we have to include all Canadians to make sure they can participate . 
we have to make sure that we respect the treaties that we have signed . 
that is exactly what we are doing and that is exactly what we are going to do . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fisheries minister is of no comfort to lobster fishermen who are afraid of losing their livelihoods . 
he is of no comfort to native families who are now facing unfair recriminations from their neighbours . 
he is certainly of no comfort to those who are concerned about the pillaging of lobster stocks . 
i went to the east coast . 
i saw the problem developing and I suggested a solution to the minister which was a way out of the mess we are in now . 
i would like to ask the minister why he failed to ask the supreme court to stay the decision and take a rehearing of this judgment . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us examine the position of the Reform Party . 
the Mi ' kmaq people , after 240 years , a quarter of a millennium , were given a treaty right . 
what the Reform Party wanted to do right away was to take that right away from the aboriginal people . 
we will not do that . 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , without even once using the word education , yesterday ' s Speech from the Throne made reference to learning , skills development , knowledge , and internship programs . 
can the Prime Minister now admit that his government wants to implement a national education policy , when this is not an area within its jurisdiction ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if they do not want to get into areas of provincial jurisdiction , the throne speech states that they want to " eliminate barriers to the mobility of citizens " - I am quoting from page 21 , to be exact - particularly those barriers " that deny some students use of their student loans when they study out - of - province '' . 
are we to understand that the government in Ottawa , after having inaugurated its millennium scholarship program , now wants to attack the award criteria for loans and bursaries that are in place in Quebec ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what we are seeking is equality for everyone , for everyone to be able to go anywhere in Canada to further their education . 
i believe it would be very good for Canada if people from the English speaking provinces could go to Quebec to study , and if people from Quebec could go to study in the rest of Canada under the same conditions . 
i feel that this is ideal , because everyone would gain from it . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the throne speech failed to mention the massive restructuring that Canada ' s airlines are about to face . 
air Canada and Canadian Airlines were in merger discussions six months prior to section 47 being invoked . 
could the minister please explain to Canadians why he invoked section 47 when he did ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is true it now appears that the two airline companies were having discussions earlier this year . 
in the month of March , Air Canada was the first to raise with my officials the use of section 47 . 
we now know that it was in connection with those discussions , but no action was taken and there was no formal request because the talks fell apart . 
in June of this year , first Air Canada , with its proposal for the Canadian Airlines international routes , and then Canadian Airlines came to us and talked about a need to restructure the industry . 
that is why we used section 47 . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the government failed to provide Canadians with its vision of our airline industry in the new millennium . 
one can only assume that it does not have one . 
why has the government failed to provide Canadians with some indication of its vision of Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is committed to a viable , strong and stable airline industry , but it is undergoing some very difficult problems , problems that will necessitate some very difficult choices on the part of Canadians and especially members in this House . 
we want a full debate in the House to elicit the views of hon. members on both sides of the House so we can develop an airline policy that will deal with the difficult matters we have to overcome in order to have a very strong and viable airline system in the 21 st century . 
* * * 
employment INSURANCE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the disastrous consequences of EI reform are well known . 
nearly 60 % of unemployed workers , youth and women in particular , do not qualify . 
this reform is creating poverty in Canada . 
setting aside the parental leave plan , will the minister explain why she has been unable to convince her Cabinet colleagues that the best way of fighting poverty is to restore access by the unemployed to the EI system , which is their ultimate safety net ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member speaks about employment insurance . 
that is one part of the government ' s strategy to help Canadians get jobs . 
all these are our government ' s approach to helping Canadians find and keep jobs . 
* * * 
peacekeeping 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) : 
will the minister inform the House of Canada ' s response to a call for humanitarian assistance as we commit resources and expertise to the UN peacekeeping efforts in East Timor ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
it was rather risky but we did that . 
we are monitoring the situation and in a few days I will be in a position to announce in the House some additional assistance as the situation in East Timor becomes such that we can go in and actually do our job in there as well . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the Prime Minister verbally proved he does not understand the farm income crisis , let alone able to devise a solution . 
let us try the agriculture minister . 
there is a 98 % drop in realized net income and not a whisper of concern in yesterday ' s throne speech . 
there was no any mention of children going hungry or parents wondering if they could stay on the farm . 
farmers never knew how far away Ottawa was until yesterday . 
my question is for the minister of agriculture . 
why is the plight of thousands of farm families not a priority for the agriculture minister and the government ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the opposition and all Canadians that even prior to last year ' s budget in February the government announced $ 900 million and , along with the provincial contribution , $ 1.5 billion to assist producers who are under stress and need that help across Canada . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government cannot in good conscience allow farmers to head into winter with no hope . 
the government likes to throw around compassionate sounding buzzwords such as the children ' s agenda . 
there are thousands and thousands of farm children whose parents are trying desperately to make ends meet . 
real children need real help and the government is turning its back . 
if the agriculture minister and government are truly interested in helping children , what do they plan to do for them to get them through this winter ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
we will continue to do all we can to find all the resources we can in co - operation with the provinces and the industry to assist all those that we can assist . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has said that the Onex takeover of Air Canada is strictly a private sector issue . 
the Minister of Transport has said that there might be some public interest at stake . 
has the Liberal government made up its mind ? 
will it listen to Canadians or let only shareholders decide the fate of our Canadian airline industry ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said earlier , we have chosen a market driven solution as the option for us to follow at this stage . 
it is up to the parties in the private sector to determine any arrangements in reorganizing the companies . 
once the private sector determines that , and once a conditional offer comes to the government , the government will be fully engaged in making sure that the five principles I enunciated a couple of weeks ago are adhered to and that the protection for Canadians on prices and other issues in the public interest is rigorously adhered to . 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister ' s market driven solution and his five principles just will not cut it . 
Canadians were promised a healthy competition within the airline industry when it was deregulated . 
instead we have seen fewer flights , wages driven down , jobs threatened , reduced service , more American influence and less Canadian influence , and now a weakened major airline . 
will the government now admit that its policy on deregulation has been an utter failure ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to make the assertion the hon. member does about deregulation is a very facile way to approach the debate . 
deregulation had many successes but there is no question that severe problems have occurred in the last few years especially with one company , Canadian Airlines . 
those issues have to be addressed and addressed in a way that protects the public interest to ensure that as we go into the next century we have a very viable air industry . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if conservation of lobster stocks is of primary importance , will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans insist that native fishers abide by the same seasons as non - native fishers ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I assure the member and the House that conservation is a priority . 
we shall ensure that we protect the resource . 
however we do have a judgment of the supreme court . 
i took great honour in recognizing that treaty right and will ensure that we live in the spirit of the judgment . 
we need to focus on the long term and make sure that we bring everybody around the table to work on a long term arrangement to fulfil and ensure that the Mi ' kmaq and the Maliseet can exercise their treaty rights . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have another question for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
in the short term the lobster fishery is regulated by licences , trap limits , size restrictions , seasons and lobster fishing areas . 
regulations ensure conservation and conservation ensures a viable fishery . 
how could the minister allow any fishery not to based on conservation ? 
will the minister answer that question ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , all fisheries are based on conservation . 
there is no fishery that is not based on conservation . 
as I said in my statement last week , if there is a fishery it will be a regulated fishery . 
i assure the hon. member that the fisheries out there now are regulated . 
we are enforcing conservation practice and conservation rules . 
* * * 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. George Proud ( Hillsborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of National Defence . 
in light of its embarrassing performance and inability to get to East Timor in time , could the minister tell the House when the government will replace the old and unreliable Hercules aircraft ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is unfortunate that one aircraft took a number of attempts to get off to the mission in East Timor . 
i must say that it was the high maintenance standards of our crew that ensured that the safety of our personnel was of paramount importance . 
when the plane was fixed it did get off . 
it was one of the earliest to arrive in East Timor and it has provided terrific service to the allied troops that are there . 
in addition , it is going through an upgrade . 
the avionics and navigation systems are going through an upgrade in the last couple of years and over the next couple of years so that they will continue to provide excellent service .

immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , people smuggling is rampant in Canada . 
boatloads of human cargo land on our shores . 
our airports are increasingly becoming sieves for illegal migrants and the government does not even care enough to prosecute the captains involved in people smuggling . 
Canadians , especially new immigrants , have called on the government to make this issue a priority , yet there is no mention of it whatsoever in the throne speech . 
why is the smuggling of human cargo , the enslavement of thousands of people and the infiltration of organized crime not important to the government ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech identified that people smuggling as a great concern to the government . 
we will not tolerate trafficking in human lives . 
the concerns we have when it comes human smuggling is that not only does it endanger the lives of the people who are in the hands of transnational organized crime but it diverts our attention from genuine refugees . 
nine people have been charged and they are presently before the courts . 
we have the toughest laws and we are looking at making them even tougher to ensure that smugglers know they will not succeed in Canada . 
* * * 
organized CRIME 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in light of the threats made by organized crime against Quebec farmers , their families , and even my colleague , the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , regarding the illegal growing of marijuana , would the Minister of Justice not have been better advised to table effective legislation in the House in order to finally do something about organized crime , instead of drafting legislation that Quebec does not want , legislation that would brand young offenders for life ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fact is that organized crime does exist . 
that is why fighting organized crime is the number one law enforcement priority of the government . 
i assure my hon. colleague that the RCMP has supported the SQ in fighting organized crime in Quebec against the farmers . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in light of the Marshall decision the severe lack of leadership has caused a devastating effect among the lobster fishermen in my home province of Nova Scotia . 
will the minister commit the necessary resources to help the Bay of Fundy inshore fishermen reach a co - operative settlement with aboriginal people for the future of the lobster fishery ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in fact I went to Moncton and met with the commercial people . 
i also spent a whole day with the aboriginal people . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
i would ask hon. members to try to contain their exuberance . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal : 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party which makes the most noise spends the least amount of time with the aboriginal community hearing about aboriginal concerns . 
i went to Atlantic Canada and in fact encouraged dialogue and discussion . 
i was very happy to see that in Nova Scotia native and non - native fishing communities working together . 
we have said that we needed community based solutions and we have been there encouraging that . 
i am very happy . 
i think we should applaud what is happening there . 
this is the way to resolve the problem . 
we have been working on a long term solution to get all the groups together to have a long term arrangement . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans confirm here and now that non - native fishers will be included in negotiations on an equal footing with native fishers and the federal government ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have said all along that to resolve these issues we must get all the parties working together toward a common solution . 
i met with the commercial fishermen and the processors . 
i spent two days out there to ensure that I had the benefit of all views . 
i also consulted with all my colleagues on both sides of the House , as well as my counterparts in fisheries . 
we have a solution in place . 
it is working because dialogue and co - operation are working .

labour 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton - Springdale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Labour . 
construction workers at federal work sites deserve to receive not only a fair wage but also fair treatment . 
could the minister tell me what she will do to ensure fair treatment ? 
hon. Claudette Bradshaw ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
the schedule will be posted and the workers will know what their wages should be . 
i would like to thank the unions and the construction workers across the country for helping us to put this in place . 
i am very happy that it has been done . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the taxpayers of Canada ' s largest cities and the provinces bear the brunt of the government ' s bungling on immigration . 
yesterday Toronto ' s mayor , Mel Lastman , said he is tired of the government ' s excuses and his city can no longer afford the Liberal ' s broken immigration system . 
the mayor of Toronto is simply expressing the frustration on immigration felt across this country . 
how does the minister respond to Toronto ' s mayor and Canadians who share his concerns ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my department is working co - operatively with the city of Toronto . 
we are trying to gather the data and the information . 
we know that this requires a response from three levels of government : the federal government , the provincial government and the municipal government . 
i want to point out that the refugee population that the mayor is concerned about represents about 10 % of the concerns that he has and we are working with him to resolve those issues . 
i want to make one point very clear . 
as we do this , the government remains committed , as opposed to the opposition party , to upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; not just for some , but for all .

PAKISTAN 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
subsequent to the military coup d ' etat in Pakistan , serious warnings were issued by the United States , most of the countries of Europe , the European Community , the secretary - general of the Commonwealth , and the head of the IMF . 
all of these called for a return to democracy as quickly as possible , and respect of the Pakistani constitution . 
can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tells us what Canada ' s position is ? 
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have done the same as the other countries . 
in addition , we have also arranged to have a meeting of the Commonwealth ministers on Monday which will apply the Harare principles to Pakistan concerning this military takeover . 
in fact , I think we are ahead of all these other countries .

points OF ORDER 
special DEBATE - FISHERIES 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think you would find unanimous consent to withdraw any existing motions for emergency debates on the fishery issue and to adopt the following : 
that during the said debate : ( 1 ) no member shall speak for more than 20 minutes , with a 10 minute question and comment period being permitted , and provided that time may be divided pursuant to Standing Order 43 ( 2 ) ; and ( 2 ) the Chair shall not receive any quorum calls , dilatory motions or requests for unanimous consent to propose any motion ; and 
that , when no member rises to speak or at 12:00 a.m. , whichever is earlier , the motion shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and the House shall adjourn to the next sitting day . 
the Speaker : 
does the member have the unanimous consent of the House to put the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed .

Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :

there is a procedural motion contained within the report to enable that committee to begin business immediately , and I should like to move concurrence in the first report .

requests FOR EMERGENCY DEBATES 
the Speaker : 
i received six applications for emergency debates for this evening . 
two of them have been withdrawn by the unanimous consent of the House , namely the applications made by the member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough and the member for Delta - South Richmond . 
that leaves me to deal with four others . 
i would ask the hon. members , as I call upon them , to state their case for an emergency debate in a very concise fashion . 
i would first call on the hon. member for Palliser . 
agriculture 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise under Standing Order 52 ( 2 ) to seek leave to propose an emergency debate to address the deepening financial crisis that is affecting far too many Canadian farm families . 
spring flooding has compounded the situation . 
those that escaped the devastation of rising waters continue to be battered by record low commodity prices and highly subsidized competition from producers in the U.S. and Europe . 
without immediate and effective help , up to half of the farmers in western Canada could be out of business by next year . 
i believe that an emergency debate is required in order to urge the government to address this crisis . 
parliament has the responsibility to find long term solutions . 
Mr. Speaker , I would urge you , respectfully , to consider an emergency debate in an immediate and timely fashion . 
the Speaker : 
i will hear the member for Selkirk - Interlake because his request deals with farming . 
i believe from the letter I received that it is in the same genre . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the crisis situation I referred to in my letter to you asking for an emergency debate absolutely involves the statistical analysis of Statistics Canada , which has clearly indicated that farm incomes will be flat and will be dropping as a result of low commodity prices and the actions of our competitors . 
this emergency arises now because last fall the standing committee on agriculture held hearings on the problem . 
as a result of those hearings and the report that was put forward it was determined by the government that the only problem was a sharp drop in income for farmers for 1998 - 99 . 
the fact is , the federal government has addressed a short , two year program that is not providing money to the majority of farmers . 
that is the reason we must have an emergency debate . 
the government has not addressed the issue . 
farmers are going bankrupt . 
calls to the Brandon , Manitoba stress line for farmers are up three times over what they were a year ago . 
we are dealing with a true crisis . 
the number of farm groups coming to Ottawa to stress their point to the minister requires that we in the House debate the issue to bring forward what the real problem is and what the solutions are . 
the Speaker : 
my colleagues from Palliser and Selkirk - Interlake , not diminishing in any way the importance of such a topic , I feel that at this time it does not meet the criteria for an emergency debate . 
i will now hear from the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast . 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 52 , I request leave to make a motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration . 
following a January 1999 British Columbia supreme court decision concerning the possession of child pornography , the British Columbia Court of Appeal did , on June 30 , 1999 , dismiss the appeal to reinstate subsection ( 4 ) of section 163.1 of the Criminal Code . 
the supreme court has scheduled a hearing on this matter for mid - January 2000 . 
given the normal time required for the supreme court judgments , this issue will not be disposed of until perhaps 2001 . 
on February 2 the minister said in the House that the government was acting immediately on the issue and would not wait for the case to reach the Supreme Court of Canada . 
sixty - three Liberal MPs and six senators signed a notice to the Prime Minister asking him to use the notwithstanding clause in this child pornography issue because it was so important last February . 
the children of this country cannot wait until 2001 to find out that child pornography is illegal to possess in Canada . 
we have to debate that issue in the House and come up with a solution to protect our children a lot quicker than the judges of this land want to protect our children . 
the Speaker : 
i do confirm that the hon. member did write to me explaining this particular case , but I do not feel at this time that it meets the criteria for an emergency debate . 
with reference to the member for Lakeland , if there was some confusion and if I did misread the information I had , I will entertain a letter to be sent to me again today so that the hon. member can address his subject tomorrow . 
we will now go to Orders of the Day . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to reply to the Speech from the Throne presented yesterday by Her Excellency the Governor General . 
in doing so I want to take the opportunity on behalf of the official opposition to extend our best wishes to the former Governor General on his retirement as well as our congratulations to the new Governor General on her appointment . 
this summer , my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the region of New Brunswick in which Mr. LeBlanc will be enjoying his retirement , and we can readily understand his desire to live in that magnificent part of the country . 
along with other members of the House , we also had the opportunity to listen to another speech by Her Excellency the Governor General at her swearing in ceremony a week ago . 
i might say it was an excellent speech . 
it was much better than the speech prepared for her by the Prime Minister . 
we wish Her Excellency well in all her future communications . 
i also want to extend on behalf of the official opposition our best wishes to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces both at home and abroad . 
their contributions to maintaining peace in the world are even more significant in light of the hardships and resource limitations that they must endure , not the least of which are those imposed upon them by their own government . 
in the next few days my colleagues will be dissecting the Speech from the Throne in considerable detail , pointing out its deficiencies , which are many , and presenting constructive alternatives . 
my task today is to deal with the big picture which I will now proceed to do . 
for example , over the summer the country faced specific problems demanding government action . 
we heard of some of them today , from people smuggling on the west coast , to violence in the east coast fishery , to an agricultural crisis on the prairies , to the need to completely reorganize the airline industry . 
the Speech from the Throne does not even acknowledge the existence of these problems , let alone offer solutions that are based on some kind of vision of the future for those sectors or some kind of fundamental principles . 
the greatest defect is the deficiency in principle and vision , a deficiency for which the government attempts to compensate with bland rhetoric . 
for example , the government refers in the speech to the principle of clarity as essential to national unity . 
it talks about the importance of principles to the national children ' s agenda . 
in most of the other sections of the speech there is no attempt to specify at all the principles that will guide the government ' s actions . 
let me start with the principles of fiscal responsibility . 
when Reformers were first elected to parliament , we won support on the basis of a commitment to certain clear - cut principles of fiscal responsibility . 
today we are even more committed to those principles because we are even more convinced they are right for Canada and Canadians . 
one of the things that bothers me profoundly is that it can be demonstrated from polling data and research data that there was majority public support in this country as early as 1984 for balancing the federal budget . 
there was majority public support for balancing the federal budget as early as 1984 and yet it took two administrations and 15 years to achieve what for most of us is a self - evident objective that should have been achieved far sooner . 
this Speech from the Throne is rife with government references , bowing and scraping toward the recognition of the global economy and high tech knowledge and computerization . 
it is the benefits that will flow . 
i have a dream . 
it is a simple one and it gets reinforced every time I go to a factory or a plant and talk to workers . 
we are talking about real , substantive tax relief . 
it is quite evident that the Canadian public , and particularly workers , are simply not going to believe promises of tax relief from anyone unless they can see it in a tangible form . 
they are going to look at their paycheques at the end of the day and they will believe they have tax relief when the federal deductions have been reduced . 
they will not believe any other promise or commitment to tax relief unless it shows up on the bottom line . 
this is our vision of tax relief . 
its impact on families could deliver up to $ 4,600 of tax relief per year per family for them to use on whatever they choose , such as education , shelter and clothing . 
we think the people themselves are the best ones to direct those expenditures whether they are socially directed or economically directed . 
but what do we see in the Liberal administration ' s implementation of these principles of fiscal responsibility ? 
we see a government whose main financial priority has been to collect and spend as many taxpayers ' dollars as it can , from $ 107 billion , or almost $ 14,000 in federal tax revenues per family in 1993 , to $ 148 billion , or $ 18,150 in federal tax revenues per family in 1999 , and still growing . 
we read in the Speech from the Throne on page 9 that the government will follow a multi - year plan for tax reduction . 
why would anyone take this at face value when we consider what the government has said and done on this subject in the past ? 
on one occasion the finance minister said that the ultimate goal was to lower taxes but - and unfortunately there is always a but - lowering taxes and reducing the fiscal load would not be possible . 
he then promptly raised federal tax revenues to $ 14,835 per family . 
the next year the finance minister said that we could not have a massive tax cut across the board , and promptly raised federal tax revenues per family to $ 15,614 . 
the next year , speaking about across the board tax cuts , the Prime Minister said " I do not think it is the right thing to do in a society like Canada '' . 
somehow it is un - Canadian to give them back some of their money . 
that year , as if to reinforce the point , the finance minister raised federal revenues per family up to $ 16,550 . 
the next year , along with the budget close to being actually balanced , the finance minister said that to put in place a broadly based tax cut now would be irresponsible . 
that year he raised federal tax revenues per family to $ 18,000 . 
is it any wonder that Canadians will regard tax relief promises from the throne speech with extreme , justifiable scepticism . 
the government ' s taxation record is in precisely the opposite direction to the direction it promises in the throne speech . 
the most deceptive half truth in the entire throne speech is on page 9 . I could hardly believe the statement , when I heard it standing in the other place . 
if it had been in the prospectus of a company filed with the Ontario Securities Commission , this half truth which fails to disclose the other half of the truth , whoever put it together would be liable to spend up to five years in a provincial institution . 
it gets this figure by adding up projected tax reductions for the financial years 1999 - 2000 , 2000 - 01 and 2001 - 02 , for a total of $ 16.5 billion . 
what it fails to mention is that during those same three years it also projects tax increases , namely through increases in CPP premiums and bracket creep , amounting to $ 18.4 billion for a net increase in the tax burden on Canadians of $ 2 billion . 
the first great deficiency in principle and vision that we see in the Speech from the Throne is the lack of principle and substantive commitment to the great principles of fiscal responsibility , in particular tax relief that is the key to both sound government and a prosperous economy for the 21 st century . 
in our judgment , this is a deficiency which cannot be remedied by trying to change tax and spend Liberals into tax cutters . 
it is a deficiency which will only be remedied by the election of 150 - plus members to the House who on a certain night in a certain month - probably February or March - are prepared to stand up in the House and vote for real , genuine , substantive tax relief . 
let me turn to economic policy in general . 
the official opposition ' s vision of an economically prosperous and secure Canada for the 21 st century includes much more than just a fiscally responsible federal government and lower taxes . 
it includes a Canada where jobs with good incomes are plentiful rather than scarce because the job creation engine is fueled , not by patronage - tainted and politically motivated grants , contracts , handouts and subsidies from the government but because it is fueled by dollars left in the pockets of consumers to spend and businesses to invest . 
it is private enterprise . 
it is an old concept but it happens to work . 
we envision a Canada where the younger generation is valued and encouraged by economic opportunity to make their future in Canada rather than being told by the Prime Minister to go to the U.S. if they are not prepared to pay exorbitant taxes . 
talk about a children ' s agenda . 
he is telling our children , " If you don ' t like the tax system here , if you think the levels are too high , go somewhere else '' . 
we envision a Canada where economically disadvantaged regions and people , including aboriginal people , are given the tools to direct and create their own economic future by participating in a free enterprise , market based economy , not a country where aboriginal people are given the obsolete , dependency creating instruments of government planning and socialist economics . 
one of the big reasons we object to the Nisga ' a treaty is that it is straight out of the 19 th century . 
there is no other group in the country that the government would have the nerve to say , " Your economic development is going to be achieved through collective rights and collective ownership of property and resources '' . 
there is no other group that the government would have the nerve to say that to . 
it then hands off those types of tools to aboriginal people . 
exactly the same mistake the country made in the 19 th century we are making as we enter the 21 st century . 
we envision a Canada where challenges faced by agriculture , the infrastructure sector , the airline industry or professional hockey are met by policies that give them tools and frameworks to solve their own problems rather than increasing dependency on the government . 
time does not permit me to deal with all the points in the Speech from the Throne where the Liberal government ' s approach to economic problems or the problems of particular sectors violate these principles , but let me touch on just three examples . 
the first example is the brain drain . 
the official opposition has some of the youngest members in the House . 
many of them spend a lot of time on university campuses and they hear about this problem all the time . 
i hear it every time I go to a campus . 
what is the question that we are asked by younger people at the universities ? 
some person will go to the microphone and say , " I ' m graduating next year with such and such a degree and my wife is graduating with such and such a degree . 
you tell me why I should stay here one day after I graduate '' . 
when I see the new pages in the Chamber I do not just think of the pages as servants of the House . 
i know many of them have ambitions and are studying far beyond spending time here in the House . 
i think of them as representatives of the younger generation who are looking for incentive , opportunity and things like that from government , not punitive taxes that create the opportunities for them somewhere else . 
the government fails to see that high taxes drive youth , capital , jobs and companies out of the country . 
its response to the brain drain is to deny it . 
it does not bring to the problem of the brain drain what free enterprise , market based principles and fiscal responsibility in government can offer those people . 
that is a huge mistake . 
it is a deficiency in principle , not approaching the problem from a principled basis , and a deficiency in vision . 
let us look for a minute at the agriculture situation . 
this summer the member for Selkirk - Interlake and the member for Souris - Moose Mountain arranged for me to spend a little time talking to farmers and producers from southwestern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan . I do not have to tell the members in the House who have a background in agriculture about the depth of the dilemma . 
we have thousands of farmers who have suffered two disasters beyond their control . 
in that particular region , the disaster was an enormous amount of flooded acreage , an inability to seed after the flooding and late seeding leading to frozen crops in the fall . 
we now have the bigger problem of foreign subsidies driving commodity prices down to the point where a large number of our farmers cannot make a living . 
it is worth looking at some of the statistics that the hon. member referred to a minute ago . 
statistics Canada confirmed that 1998 was a disastrous year for Canada ' s farmers . 
realized net income was down 21 % over the year before . 
agriculture Canada forecasts even worse for 1999 . National realized net income of $ 2.2 billion and that figure includes payments from the government ' s AIDA program . 
the hardest hit will be Saskatchewan where Agriculture Canada predicts a net loss of $ 48 million . 
Manitoba will fare only slightly better earning $ 64 million , a little less than the net realized farm income of Prince Edward Island . 
this is one of the great agricultural provinces of the prairies yet that is what its net income is . 
i ask the Prime Minister to listen to this . 
put another way , the realized net income for all farmers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan taken together will be down 98 % from the previous four year average . 
i cannot imagine that if any other group had statistics show that its net realized income had fallen 98 % because of something beyond its control the government would not respond . 
however , in the Speech from the Throne there is no visionary response to this problem . 
i do not want to labour this but I will read the statistics . 
i have been going to farm meetings ever since I belonged to a 4 - H club in the Horse Hill area of Alberta in the 1950 s . 
i have gone to all kinds of agricultural meetings with different commodity groups , et cetera . 
at some of the meetings we went to this summer we talked to people in this dilemma . 
i cannot recall ever having seen people who could not even talk about the problem . 
it was not because of their bottom lines but because they were losing the farm that their grandfather had . 
it was because of what it was doing to their families , the stress lines that the hon. member mentioned . 
people are calling for help from psychiatrists , ministers and everybody else and the government does not respond . 
the government has to do three things . 
it must first recognize that its AIDA program is a joke and is not working . 
the agriculture minister goes around saying that the government has promised farmers $ 25 or $ 50 an acre to put together with the provinces . 
i defy the government to find one farmer who has actually received $ 25 an acre . 
some farmers pay $ 500 to accountants to fill out the forms to get $ 40 back while others pay $ 500 only to be told that they do not qualify for anything . 
nobody gets what is in the press releases because there are a whole lot of strings attached : what was their last three years ' average ; what is their deductible , et cetera . 
there are 100 reasons for not getting the money . 
they want to know where the replacement for AIDA is and they want it fast . 
secondly , where is the expanded crop insurance program that includes disaster relief ? 
this business of inventing a new ad hoc program every time there is a natural disaster is crazy . 
why do we not extend crop insurance to include broad based disaster insurance ? 
Thirdly - and this is one for the prime minister - where is the team Canada mission to Europe that is not just a glad - handing exercise but includes the prime minister , the minister of trade , the foreign minister and the agriculture minister and which makes a powerful argument with the Europeans that their subsidies are killing our farmers ? 
if we are committed to free trade , and the government professes to be committed to free trade , this is not just knocking down trade barriers and subsidies at home . 
yes , it does include that and we have supported that , but it also means being even more vigorous at knocking down the other guy ' s trade barriers . 
if the prime minister has great influence with President Clinton , why does he not use it on behalf of the farmers ? 
if Canada and the U.S. teamed up to fight European subsidies rather than the U.S. just outbidding them , we could have an impact on those subsidies which are killing our farmers . 
i suspect the reason the government does not take this approach is because it really is not committed to market based , free enterprise ways of solving this problem . 
it will cut our subsidies but it does not go after the other guys . 
there is one other sector where I see a deficiency in the government ' s approach which is again a backward looking approach . 
the speech states nothing at all about the need for north - south trade corridors , the need to build the transportation networks and rebuild the transportation networks that are moving a billion dollars of trade a day across the American borders . 
if the government looked at that it would soon come to the conclusion that there are not enough dollars in the public works budget of the Government of Canada and the highways departments of all the provinces to even meet the physical infrastructure investment requirements of the west . 
if we add them all up , there is not enough to even meet the requirements for building infrastructure in the west over the next 20 years . 
what does that mean ? 
it means we are going to have to find massive amounts of capital for investment and infrastructure from other sources . 
i say that the only place we are going to find that is in the private sector . 
my conclusion is that the second great deficiency of principle and vision that we see in the Speech from the Throne is the lack of a principled substantive commitment to encouraging and facilitating individual and corporate enterprise and better operations of free markets to solve the actual practical problems in many of these particular sectors . 
i have already spoken of Reform ' s vision of fiscal responsibility and the need for governments to constrain their natural appetites for excessive taxation and misdirected involvement in the economy . 
however , fiscal and economic ideals are not ends in themselves . 
they are but means to more important ends . 
those more important ends for us are social and moral in nature . 
the most important social responsibility is the protection and nurturing of the family . 
let us look at what this throne speech does in those two areas . 
when it comes to criminal justice , we have a vision of Canada as a safe society where people can live their lives , walk on the streets , drive on the highways , go to school , go to work , shop in the stores , visit the parks and live in their homes without fear of harm to themselves or their property or , even worse , fear of harm to their loved ones . 
i think of the many seniors we run into when we are door - knocking as all of us do . 
some of them are women who pioneered in the workforce while raising families . 
many of them are people who built our homes , our towns and our cities . 
do we not owe our seniors more than a pension ? 
do we not have a moral and social obligation to protect their physical safety and to lift the federal government ' s constitutional obligation to create peace and order off the dry pages of the constitution and give people peace and order in the place where they live ? 
it seems to us the only people who are really sticking their necks out to protect citizens from crime are police officers , particularly the ones who work on the streets . 
these are the men and women who literally put their lives at risk every day to make public safety a reality . 
how does the government treat them ? 
it slashes their budgets and it turns their work and their risks into a mockery through a revolving door parole system and an unbalanced justice system . 
when we examine the policies and actions of the government we find them lacking in commitment to this principle . 
let me take the classic illustration of this point from the events of this summer . 
federal law , as everyone in the House knows , provides for the legal entrance into the country of immigrants and genuine refugees . 
however those laws were repeatedly violated this summer by international gangsters smuggling illegal entrants into Canada on our west coast . 
this people smuggling is not only illegal but is a gross affront to the hundreds of thousands of legitimate immigrants and legitimate refugees who have waited patiently in line and fulfilled everything we have asked of them - all the hoops , all the paperwork , all the time delays - in order to have legitimate legal standing in the country . 
the points I am making have been pointed out by official opposition critics for immigration and justice , but I want to repeat them again . 
the official opposition has called for expedited procedures to detect , detain and assess illegal immigrants and to immediately deport those who are not genuine refugees . 
in doing so we are not calling for something unusual or draconian . 
this is what the 1987 amendments to the 1976 Immigration Act were supposed to accomplish . 
why do we not do something about it ? 
the problem is that in 1985 the Singh decision by the supreme court ruled that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to everyone who is physically present in Canada , even if they got here illegally and even if they have no legal standing whatsoever . 
so we hand to those engaged in people smuggling and to illegal entrants , regardless of their status , all the legal tools required to fight deportation hearings , deportation procedures and deportation orders . 
it is an issue of criminal justice . 
we look to the federal government for a solution to make its laws enforceable so that rights granted to persons without legal standing in our country and violating its laws , are not allowed to tarnish or diminish the rights and privileges of those who fully comply with our laws . 
what is the third great deficiency in principle and vision that we see in the speech ? 
it is a lack of principled and substantive commitment to criminal justice reform , in particular reforms which ensure that when the rights of law abiding citizens and victims of crime conflict with the rights of the perpetrators of crime it is the former that prevail over the latter . 
as I said earlier , the social vision of Reformers attaches the highest priority to the protection and nurturing of the family . 
our vision of Canada regards the family as the most important organizational unit of society . 
last weekend was Thanksgiving . 
Mr. Speaker , what are you thankful for ? 
what am I thankful for ? 
well , many things . 
i am thankful for being a Canadian . 
i am thankful for growing up within driving distance of the Rocky Mountains . 
i am thankful for a Christian heritage and for the religious liberty which allows each of us to turn toward God or away from God and to accept the consequences of our own moral decisions . 
i am thankful for political freedoms . 
reformers complain a lot about the political system of the country , but I am thankful for the freedom that allows my friends and me to start a political party and to try to change the government . 
i am most thankful in my life for my family , and I think a lot of members share this . 
what was the most important thing Sandra and I did on Thanksgiving ? 
we spent time with our family , as many other members did . 
i am thankful for the kindness and nurturing of my mother and for the wisdom and example of my late father . 
he was my hero . 
i am thankful for my wife , Sandra , and for the spiritual foundations of our marriage which have enabled us to withstand all the stresses and strains that everybody here knows politics puts on a marriage . 
i am thankful for the effort Sandra makes to keep our family healthy and strong and the way so many of our spouses sacrifice their own interests for us to be playing in this game . 
i am thankful for my own boys who have grown up to be strong and sensible with the help of a lot of other people besides myself , and who can do so many things from fishing to making music to operating computers far better than I can do . 
i am thankful for my daughters ; for their relentless pursuit of excellence in sport and education ; for making life and faith commitments of their own ; for their choices in husbands , the two who are married ; and for the strength that these men bring to our family . 
i am thankful for three precious little grandchildren , with another one on the way , who find love and acceptance and roots in the family while at the same time becoming its brightest promise and prospects for the future . 
i am thankful that such a family allows us to support and care for each other : children , parents , grandparents , great grandparents and siblings , and turn to one another in times of need instead of having no one to turn to other than a stranger on the end of some government telephone line . 
in expressing this thankfulness for family I am not denying for a moment the importance of government services , whether it is health , education or social assistance , that help the well - being of families . 
i am not denying for a moment the harsh realities of all those who because of economic , social or personal circumstances have lost or been denied the benefits of family , or those for whom family has been transformed into a place of violence and insecurity . 
it should not focus on government programs that attempt to substitute for families . 
it should focus first and foremost on supporting the family directly . 
it might start at the beginning , if it had the moral nerve , by defining the rights of the unborn . 
this it will have to do if it intends to reintroduce its bill on reproductive technologies . 
it will have to get into that subject and it would be better to do it sooner rather than later . 
second , if the Liberal government really wants to do something for children , it should state clearly the definitions of marriage and family which it believes are most conducive to the well - being of children . 
on June 8 , 1999 , for example , the House passed by a vote of 216 for and 55 against a resolution moved by the hon. member for Calgary Centre which read as follows : 
that , in the opinion of this House , it is necessary , in light of public debate around recent court decisions , to state that marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others , and that Parliament will take all necessary steps - 
where are the steps ? 
we did not see any in the Speech from the Throne . 
- within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve this definition of marriage in Canada . 
the government ' s support of this motion was a good step but it should be followed by another . 
if the Liberal government really wants to do something for children , it should also clarify the definition of family as the primary biological and social context into which our children are born . 
it is the Reform Party ' s conviction that a family should be defined as individuals related by blood , marriage or adoption . 
members should note that this definition is broad . 
it is not a narrow definition of family . 
it is broad enough to embrace a so - called traditional family , common law relationships , the single parent family and the extended family which is so important to many new Canadians . 
affirming these definitions of marriage and the family is not to say that parliament cannot recognize in law other relationships of dependency , but in our judgment these should not be confused in law or public policy with marriage defined as the union of a man and a woman or the familial relations based on that union . 
some might argue on the basis of the supreme court ' s recent M. v H . decision that the court is headed , whether we like it or not , in the direction of saying that in Canadian law a couple is a couple is a couple , regardless of the basis of the relationship . 
however I believe I speak for the majority of parliamentarians , not just Reformers , when I say that it is parliament ' s intention , that it was parliament ' s intention and that it is still parliament ' s intention that the union of a man and a woman , which is unique in its potential for the natural procreation and nurturing of children , should be in a category by itself as should be the familial relations based upon it . 
on page 22 the throne speech states that Canada will champion efforts at the United Nations to eliminate the exploitation of children . 
if this is the case , the government should then direct the courts here at home to stop protecting the consumers of child pornography . 
when parliament passed that section of the criminal code , and that debate has gone before the B.C. court , it intended that the possession of child pornography should be treated as a crime . 
why ? 
because possession represents the demand side of the pornography industry . 
if one wants to shut down the pornography industry one has to go after the demand side and not just the supply side . 
if the criminal code does not make it crystal clear that is what parliament intended , the government should introduce legislation that makes that crystal clear to the courts . 
if the courts still insist that section of the criminal code is not charter compatible , the government should not hesitate to use the notwithstanding clause now to enforce such a provision . 
surely if the government values children it will put their right to protection from the evils of pornography ahead of any adult ' s right to possess child pornography . 
the throne speech also expresses particular concern about child poverty while often ignoring the family context in which much of that poverty occurs . 
the government takes in $ 6 billion and tries to figure out how some complicated program , which will cost a lot administratively , will give them back a couple of hundred dollars for this or that . 
it is a deficiency which in our judgment cannot be remedied until there are 150 - plus members in the House who are convinced in their hearts as well as their heads that the number one social priority of government should be the protection and nurturing of the family . 
i have three examples . 
there is the impact of the Singh decision on the government ' s ability to halt people smuggling . 
what difference does it make if this parliament sets up the ideal system for handling immigrants and refugees ? 
as long as the Singh decision stands , there are legal ways around it . 
it can be fought every step of the way for seven years . 
there is the impact of the B.C. court decision in the Sharpe case which legitimates demand for child pornography . 
it is already having a secondary impact in other parts of the country while we wait and wait for a court decision that may not come . 
there is the impact of the Marshall decision on the management of the east coast fishery . 
i understand we will have a debate tonight during which we can get into this in detail . 
the member for Delta - South Richmond will be saying a lot on this a little later . 
in the Marshall case the court affirmed an aboriginal fishing right from a treaty that does not contain the word fish . 
talk about writing things in , that is a good example . 
apparently no one , and this is the responsibility of the government and not the court , made a convincing case for the dangers of having one law for aboriginals and another law for non - aboriginal fishermen . 
the court made a fishery policy as distinct from parliament making a fishery policy leading to , in this case , violence and chaos on the east coast fishery . 
switching to the positive , the official opposition has a vision of the proper relationship between parliament , the court and the executive . 
it is a vision that is rooted in our own Constitution and several hundred years of British constitutional convention and precedents . 
it is based on a simple principle , that parliament makes the law , the administration administers the law and the court interprets the law . 
the root of the problem is that the BNA Act of 1867 founded Canada on a constitution " similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom '' . 
one of the founding principles is that parliament makes the law , the executive implements the law and the courts interpret it . 
this law included for the first time in Canada a constitutionally entrenched guarantee of civil rights . 
it served the same function in Canada as the U.S. bill of rights but without any of the checks and balances on the three branches of government which are found in the American Constitution . 
that is what happens when you transplant an idea from one constitutional system to another . 
you do not necessarily bring along with it the checks and balances that made it work in the original situation . 
with the introduction of the charter to the Canadian Constitution a great departure began from the historic division of responsibilities between parliament and the courts which continues to this very day . 
the consequences of that departure include replacement of the supremacy of parliament with the supremacy of the Constitution as interpreted by judges . 
they include a transfer of power from parliament and the legislatures to the courts , including a transfer of the ultimate right of interpretation . 
the other consequence is the thrusting , whether they want it or not , of unelected judges with no direct accountability to the people into the realm of decision making and political activism . 
the consequences of this great departure and the political activism of the courts are enormous . 
the Mah é decision of 1990 took the courts into the operation of school boards . 
the Eldridge decision of 1993 took the court into affecting provincial government budgetary decisions . 
the Singh case of 1985 , as already pointed out , took the court into the administration of immigration and refugee procedures . 
the Therens case of 1985 created an enhanced role for lawyers in criminal proceedings that went far too far and which has had negative effects . 
we saw further evidence of political and social activism by the courts when they created the defence of self - induced intoxication , something parliament never ever dreamed about in any of its wildest moments . 
that was via the Daviault case in 1994 . 
there was court direction of public policy with respect to vagrancy via the Heywood case of 1994 . There was the extension of the requirement for the use of warrants to unreasonable lengths via the Feeney case of 1997 . 
at such time it would be my intention to lay before parliament a number of measures for clearly delineating a line between ourselves and the courts . 
these measures include a number of things , of which I will mention three . 
first would be measures to ensure that parliament specifies in each statute it passes the intent of that statute and that it obtains independent legal advice , because we cannot get it from the justice department , on the charter compatibility of bills before they leave this place rather than after . 
it is a process of pre - legislative review . 
we would also recommend that these remedial measures include the establishment of a judicial review committee of parliament to prepare an appropriate parliamentary response to those court decisions that misconstrue parliament ' s intent , and include recommendations of the appropriate use of the notwithstanding clause which I remind hon. members is just as much a part of our Constitution as is the charter of rights and freedoms . 
when we look at the Speech from the Throne we do not see any recognition of this even though it affects everything we pass here . 
why is that ? 
i suspect it is because on many of the issues affected by the political activism of the courts , especially in moral and social areas , the Liberal administration would prefer to have the hard decisions made by Liberal appointed judges rather than by the elected members . 
if that is the case , we will not see a remedy to this problem until there are 150 - plus members elected to this Chamber with a commitment to change and to draw the line crystal clear between parliament and the courts . 
as all members here know , Canada is the second largest nation in terms of territory on the face of the earth . 
it consists of ten provinces and three territories encompassing an enormous breadth of cultural and regional diversity . 
in order to unify this great diversity into one nation from sea to sea to sea , our forefathers rightly chose to apply the principles of federalism . 
canada is therefore a federal state , but because of its size and diversity it is a federal state that cannot take its internal unity for granted even for a month . 
let us look at the present state of our federal union and the Speech from the Throne from this perspective . 
this summer my wife and I spent several weeks in the west , two weeks in Quebec , two weeks in Ontario , and almost three weeks in Atlantic Canada . 
we attended some 80 different functions , many of them informal social functions which gave us a good opportunity to interact with people . 
we listened to the predictable concerns of people about taxes , jobs and health care . 
but we also perceived something else , something less defined and yet very real and something that is bigger than people ' s day to day concerns . 
there are four big regional concerns and aspirations which I believe are abroad in our land and which this federal parliament must recognize and address in order to maintain the unity and progress of this country in the 21 st century . 
let me begin in the west . 
i like beginning in the west . 
in June , Sandra and I travelled to the Milk River country of southern Alberta . 
there we borrowed two horses and a tent from a longtime rancher in the Milk River area , Tom Gilchrist . 
for three days we joined the anniversary trail ride commemorating the 1874 march west of the original North West Mounted Police contingent ; a great adventure which originally took 275 officers and men from Fort Dufferin south of Winnipeg all through the southern part of Saskatchewan and southern Alberta to Fort Whoop - Up 125 years before . 
that original group of North West Mounted Police included Colonel James MacLeod who would lay the foundation for a treaty with the great Blackfoot confederacy on the basis of a simple principle : equality under the law . 
i wish James MacLeod had been around when they were putting together the Nisga ' a treaty . 
that is how he made peace with the fiercest group of aboriginals left on the prairies . 
it was the last group to have a confrontation with the Europeans . 
he made it on a simple basis . 
a couple of RCMP walked into a huge camp . 
there was one law , the same law , for whites and Indians . 
he did a few things to back it up and that was the basis of that peace . 
he became the greatest premier the old North - West Territories ever had . 
he was the one who negotiated the provincial terms of entry of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the federal union as provinces . 
what was the principle he insisted on , even though he did not get it ? 
equality for provinces . 
equality between the new provinces and the old provinces . 
members of that same old Northwest Mounted Police contingent would soon establish another fort at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers , Fort Calgary , the place where over a century later nine premiers and two territorial leaders would meet and produce a declaration asserting the principle of equality of all Canadians and provinces under the law and that any power given to one province to protect and develop its uniqueness would be given to the others . 
equality for individuals and provinces was as much a founding principle of the old west as accommodation to the French - English fact was a founding principle of central Canada . 
that old west , including British Columbia , was wild and vast with enormous potential . 
it attracted people of enterprise and initiative who overcame all sorts of obstacles and hardships . 
members should read the story of the original march west by the RCMP if they want a story of overcoming hardship . 
that old west had all sorts of new ideas and convictions on how the west itself should be governed . 
but politically the old west had one huge problem . 
it was politically impotent . 
at the turn of the last century the west produced less than 10 % of the GNP , had less than 10 % of the population and had less than 10 % of the seats in this parliament . 
the old west lacked political clout to impress its concerns on the federal government , let alone impress its ideas . 
it quickly and unfortunately developed an underdog attitude that if it participated in negotiations with the national government or if it participated in political dialogue with people in other parts of the country it would rarely win the debate and would always be outvoted and outnumbered . 
what struck me as I rode through that country commemorating the opening up of the old west was how far the west has come in a century and how different the position of the new west entering the 21 st century is in comparison to what the old west was at the turn of the century . 
in that Milk River country , if one stands at the right place , the Cypress Hills can be seen to the east , the Sweet Grass Hills of Montana to the south and Chief Mountain to the west . 
these were all sacred places to the Blackfoot . 
they were high places from which the Blackfoot believed they could see forever and from which they believed they could see the future . 
it was a place where the young saw visions and the old dreamed dreams . 
could any of the people who mounted those heights at the turn of the last century , aboriginal or non - aboriginal , possibly have envisioned the new west of the 21 st century ? 
the new west is no longer politically impotent . 
in the 21 st century it will be impossible to implement any truly national policy without the west ' s concurrence or to form any truly national government without western participation . 
the great challenge for westerners is how to use this newfound influence . 
there will be some , " little westerners " Haultain would have called them , who will advocate that the new west should use its growing influence simply to settle old scores and that the west should confine itself to addressing its own immediate regional interests . 
these people will prefer regional parties over national parties . 
there will even be some who will say , regrettably , that the new west should use its influence to separate from Canada . 
fortunately there will be others , " big westerners " Haultain would call them , who will advocate a much more positive and inclusive course . 
reform is the principle and Reform is the voice of the new west . 
we say yes , the new west should use its influence to protect and advance regional interests , to raise the agricultural concerns of the prairies higher on the national agenda , to protect the oil and gas producing regions from another raid by the federal government , to prevent the west coast fishery from suffering the same abuse as the east coast fishery and to make B.C. Canada ' s gateway to the Asia - Pacific . 
we also say that the new west should use its new influence in the federation to address and resolve the problems of the federation as a whole , to get the federal financial house in order by insisting that tax and debt levels be lowered for all Canadians , by advocating that national health care - medicare , after all , was born in the west - be reformed for the benefit of all Canadians , by insisting that federal institutions be made more representative and democratically accountable for all Canadians , and by insisting that the equality of all Canadians and all provinces under the law become a governing constitutional principle throughout the entire country and be pounded into the heads of members of parliament . 
when we look at the Speech from the Throne from this perspective , what do we see ? 
we see no evidence at all that the federal government even recognizes the existence or emergence of the new west , let alone a preparedness to accommodate its aspirations . 
the federal government is at odds , in particular with British Columbia , on everything from the mismanagement of immigration and refugees to the mismanagement of the fishery to the mismanagement of aboriginal relations . 
it has negotiated a treaty with the Nisga ' a which is based not on the principle of equality of all under the law , but on the divisive principle of one law for aboriginals and another for non - aboriginals . 
rather than offering tax incentives to reduce greenhouse emissions , the government has mused about imposing a green tax which would discriminate against the petroleum producing regions without proposing any compensatory measures or equivalent environmental taxes on competing energy sources . 
by failing to propose or mount a concerted international attack on European agricultural subsidies , it refuses to get at the root of the low commodity prices that are doing enormous damage to our farmers . 
the Prime Minister has never followed up on that resolution we passed in the House one night , which members voted for , calling on the federal government to help communicate the real significance of the Calgary declaration to Quebec . 
the Speech from the Throne and the Liberal government are completely oblivious to the spirit and the aspirations of the new west . 
this is a deficiency which is inexcusable in a federal system where the federal government must recognize regional aspirations and respond to them for the sake and well - being of Canadians living in those regions , as well as national unity . 
i said there were four strong winds . 
the wind coming out of the new west is only one . 
in Ontario , the federal government must recognize and accommodate the aspirations of the common sense revolution . 
it has not done so and there is little in the Speech from the Throne that indicates it is prepared to do so . 
in 1993 the people of Ontario elected the tax cutting , common sense government of Premier Harris to get that province ' s financial house in order . 
premier Harris proceeded to do so by cutting taxes 30 % , introducing programs like workfare as preferable to welfare , while still spending 50 % more dollars on health care in that one province than this government spends on health care in the entire country . 
in 1997 Mr. Harris asked the people of Ontario whether they wanted his government to continue on this common sense course and , in particular , whether they wanted him to continue to cut taxes . 
despite the fierce opposition of both federal and provincial Liberals , the Harris government was returned by the people of Ontario with a solid majority . 
we offer them our heartiest congratulations . 
there is a strong wind blowing across Ontario . 
it is the wind of the common sense revolution . 
it is completely counterproductive for the largest government in the country , the federal government , to pursue tax policies that are at cross purposes with the tax policies of the largest provincial government . 
people in Ontario are concerned , like people in Alberta , that tax and spend federal Liberals will move into the hard earned vacated tax room created by the provincial government . 
they want the principles of the common sense revolution to be respected and implemented in Ottawa as well as Queen ' s Park . 
yet , there is not a flicker of recognition in the Speech from the Throne of that political reality . 
it fails to recognize , let alone respect , the principal fiscal interest of the largest province in Canada . 
i talked about four strong winds . 
i have two so far . 
there is an easterly wind beginning to blow in this country . 
the Atlantic provinces are bestirring themselves in a manner which is good for them and good for the country . 
some of these policies , and they represent a departure from what the federal government has done , were first proposed and pursued by Premier McKenna of New Brunswick , who has just denounced the federal Liberals ' approach to regional economic development in the strongest possible terms . 
according to a Globe and Mail report , Mr. McKenna has unleashed a scorching indictment of the federal government ' s treatment of Atlantic Canada . 
the federal Liberals , he said , have nothing in the window for his region . 
he speaks of " their total ignorance of the issues of shipbuilding , their total ignorance of the very highly developed information technology sector which is taking place here , their disgraceful management of the fisheries issue and the resource issue having to do with the natives '' . 
all of these things , he said , are just more nails in their coffin . 
premier McKenna ' s initiatives were largely abandoned by his successor at the provincial level , who paid the price at the polls . 
in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia two tired and discredited Liberal administrations have been turned out of office and replaced by the Conservative ministries of Mr. Lord and Dr. Hamm . 
in both elections the smell of patronage and federal political interference in provincial highway projects was a factor in the defeat of the provincial Liberal administrations , and both of these administrations are seeking to pursue new approaches to economic growth . 
we extend our heartiest congratulations to both . 
the winds of change are blowing in Atlantic Canada . 
yet , when we examine the Speech from the Throne , supposedly the speech laying out the legislative program of the federal government which claims it lies awake nights trying to figure out how to make this federation work better , there is no recognition of this regional fact at all , no new principles or visions that respond to the new wind that is blowing out of Atlantic Canada . 
that brings me to the fourth wind . 
the fourth wind that a perceptive and sensitive federal government would be recognizing and seeking to accommodate would be the new wind that is stirring in Quebec . 
it is still a light breeze , but there are signs in the polls and the political discussion in that province that perhaps up to 15 % of the Quebec electorate is open to a third way , une troisi è me voie : not separation for Canada , not the status quo federalism of the Liberals and the Prime Minister , but reform of the federation with a rebalancing of the powers between the federal and provincial governments for the 21 st century , a rebalancing that would strengthen the federal government in some of its key areas of jurisdiction , strengthen the provinces in some of their key areas of jurisdiction , particularly health , education and social assistance , and include jurisdiction for the provinces over language and culture . 
yet , when we examine the Speech from the Throne and the application of the principles of federalism to the maintenance of national unity , what do we see ? 
as I have said , we see nothing that truly recognizes the growing and diverse regional aspirations of the west , Ontario or Atlantic Canada . 
when it comes to addressing the concerns of Quebec we see nothing of the principle or the vision of a reformed federalism , only a continuation of the status quo plus a veiled reference to defining a federal position on the secession process and question . 
i find it absolutely amazing that a government that prides itself on always taking the balanced approach - how many times have we heard it , always seeking the balanced approach between spending and tax cuts , between debt reduction and taxation - when it comes to national unity it takes a totally unbalanced approach . 
when it comes to national unity and adjusting federalism to accommodate the strains of regional - provincial interests , the government spends 90 % of its time thinking about Quebec and 10 % of its time thinking about the rest of the country . 
when it comes to Quebec , the government spends 90 % of the time trying to defend and perpetuate an unacceptable status quo . 
when it comes to advocating something new to provide a way out of the constitutional box for either discontented federalists or for weary nationalists in Quebec , instead of presenting both plan A and plan B in balance so Quebecers understand all their options and the consequences of them , the Speech from the Throne contains no plan A and only a veiled reference to a plan B proposal for federal legislation on the secession referendum process and question . 
the Prime Minister must come across in Quebec as the schoolyard bully . 
when the sovereignists show strength , as in the last referendum , he grovels and promises anything , like constitutional recognition of distinct society which he had opposed for 36 years . 
however , when he thinks his opponents are weakening , he plays the tough guy who is willing to go to court . 
on the question of national unity , Quebecers are used to seeing the Prime Minister playing the blow - hard . 
that has been his style throughout his political career . 
the Prime Minister is brave when his adversaries are disorganized , but he makes himself scarce as soon as they begin to rally round . 
if federalists are going to speak credibly to Quebecers we must be consistent and balanced . 
we should recognize that status quo federalism has little appeal in particular to the young . 
we should not risk a revival of support for separation as a reaction to clumsy miscalculations by status quo federalists . 
if plan A and plan B are to be presented they must be presented in balance , with plan A representing reform of the federation with the priority being given to communicating it to those who are searching for a third way . 
those are the four big winds that we see blowing across the country . 
we see nothing in the Speech from the Throne that shows any recognition of them whatsoever , that shows any preparedness to harness them for the benefit of the country in the 21 st century and no adjustment of federalism beyond the status quo . 
in our judgment , this deficiency will not be remedied until there are 150 - plus members of parliament from all parts of the country committed to that vision of a reformed federation for the 21 st century . 
one might ask why there is so much public interest and support throughout the country for things like tax relief , criminal justice reform , the strengthening of families , health care reform and the reform of federal - provincial relations to make them more co - operative and productive , and yet so little principled commitment or action on these fronts in the legislative program of the federal government . 
the answer lies in the fact that the federal political institutions of the country , in particular this parliament and this House of Commons , are defective in terms of their capacity to accurately assess and represent the public will and to respond democratically to public demands . 
this is why Reformers want not simply to reform particular fiscal , social , economic or justice policies of the government . 
we want to reform the system itself whereby these policies are developed and implemented in the first place . 
we have a vision of a country and a system of government that is truly democratic , not simply democratic in appearance , not an autocracy where people get a chance to vote for the autocrat every four years , but a genuine democracy where the institutions are truly representative and accountable and where the first allegiance of members of parliament is not to their party or to themselves but to the people who elect them . 
we envision a parliament where the upper house is a credit and a complement to democracy , not the disgrace to democracy that it is now . 
we envision a Senate that is democratically elected with equal numbers per province and effective powers to safeguard and represent regional interests . 
if the country had a workable Senate , in particular the way the Fathers of Confederation envisioned it to be , the first place where these four regional winds that are blowing would register in Parliament is the Senate . 
as it is , it is the last place . 
they could have a hurricane over there and they would not even recognize it as a wind . 
we envision a parliament where there is genuine free voting in both the Houses , not just on private members ' bills or on exceptional occasions when the government does not want to touch a moral issue with a 10 - foot pole , but every day on issues of substance and on government bills and opposition motions of every description . 
if a government motion is defeated or an opposition motion is carried the government will not resign . 
it will respect that vote and only resign in response to the passage of an explicit vote of no confidence '' . 
can hon. members imagine even for a moment what a difference that one simple change would make to improve the democratic nature of this place ? 
the capacity of every single member to more effectively represent constituents ' interests would be increased , in particular when the constituents ' will conflicts with the party line . 
they could initiate legislation . 
debates would no longer be meaningless , sequential soliloquies because members would actually be free to change their mind or their positions as a result of something that some other member had said . 
legislation would be enacted perhaps not in exactly the same form that it was originally introduced by the government , but enacted nevertheless by majority vote and in accordance with a broader cross - section of public and national opinion than would otherwise be the case . 
in other words , we envision a democratic parliamentary system where the principles of genuine democracy , of effective representation , of true accountability , of free votes and of public participation are actually practised and reflected in the day to day operations of our institution . 
they marked their ballots in the spirit of democracy . 
perhaps the most encouraging thing for Canadian democrats this summer was a conference held at Bird ' s Hill Provincial Park in Manitoba by the First Nations Accountability Coalition , a group now representing grassroots aboriginal people from more than 200 first nations communities across the country . 
what were they talking about ? 
they were talking about fiscal and democratic accountability for on - reserve governments and the department of Indian affairs . 
not a flicker of enthusiasm for any of the great democratic principles and reforms that would make the country a model democracy for the 21 st century . 
they sit in the balcony expecting to see a model democracy . 
i have devoted almost the entirety of my reply to the Speech from the Throne to demonstrating its greatest flaws : its deficiency in principle and vision . 
this brings me to my final point . 
the official opposition is deeply committed to these principles . 
for example , across the country there are hundreds and thousands of supporters and voters for various political parties who believe in the principle of fiscal responsibility , in particular the need for national tax and debt reduction . 
however , because so many of the people who hold these convictions are divided in their political loyalties between various political parties , between several federal parties , or between provincial parties that espouse these principles and federal parties of the same name that do not , it has not been possible to amass the political support required to elect the 150 - plus members needed in this parliament to make real tax reduction and tax relief a reality . 
across the country there are millions of people who would agree in principle that Canada needs to make a new commitment to law and order , to preserving the family and to reforming federal - provincial relations . 
however , again , because the political loyalties of those people are divided among various political groups , the country ends up being governed by a party that is committed to none of these principles and elected with only 38 % of the vote . 
it could be argued that if only we could secure some of these democratic reforms I have enumerated , in particular free voting in the House or some change in the electoral system , it would then be much more possible to form temporary or permanent coalitions of members of the House who are committed to the same principles but find themselves currently divided by party lines and loyalties . 
there is a catch - 22 to that argument . 
in order to implement those democratic reforms , we need the 150 - plus votes required to carry a motion or a bill and no such free voting or committed majority exists in this Chamber at the present time . 
what is this telling us ? 
what is this telling Canadians ? 
it is telling us that there is a need for a realignment of the party lines in the country in order to implement policies based on widely shared principles and values be they those that I have enumerated or some other set of principles that others may define . 
it is to advance the principle of political realignment , the principle that party lines and party structures must be adjusted from time to time to better unite rather than further divide all those who share certain common principles essential to the implementation of public policy conducive to good government , that the official opposition has offered to work with others like - minded , regardless of past party affiliation , to create a principled united alternative to the current administration in time for the next election . 
in this partisan House , I am well aware that arguments in favour of co - operation across party lines for the sake of the country usually fall on deaf ears . 
however , out in the real world where voters and taxpayers live this is not the case . 
i believe that increasing numbers of Canadians are watching us with two questions in mind whether or not we as practising politicians want to recognize it . 
they are watching first to see whether any existing party is willing to make a sincere effort to define new common ground on which large numbers of Canadians could unite in new ways to lower taxes , to heal the health care , to democratize their institutions and to unite our country , all the things the status quo Liberal administration has been unable to provide . 
second , they are watching to see if any existing party is so committed to these principles that it is prepared to set aside its own partisan goals , even if for a moment , and work with others who are like minded , regardless of past party affiliation , in order to implement those principles at the federal level . 
two weekends ago the once great Progressive Conservative Party of Canada said no to both the idea of seeking new common ground and setting aside its own narrow partisan goals to work with others . 
it will have to live with the consequences of that decision , the kind of inward looking thinking that reduced its representation from 169 seats in the 34 th Parliament to 2 seats in the 35 th Parliament , that has reduced its party membership from 90,000 a year ago to 18,000 under the current leadership , at least half of whom reject the traditional conservative principles of both fiscal conservatism and free trade . 
the Reform Party of Canada and the official opposition in this Chamber has said yes to both those questions . 
over the next few months it will continue to explore whether it is possible to build a new principled alternative to the unprincipled and visionless administration in time for a new century . 
the original Fathers of Confederation had a dream . 
we should remember this because a similar challenge was faced by a parliament long ago that created our country . 
the original Fathers of Confederation had a dream that could not be realized until there was a political realignment in the old parliament of Canada . 
i too have a dream of a new and better Canada that requires a political realignment if it is to be fulfilled early in the new millennium . 
it has sometimes been asked how was it that the original Fathers of Confederation , a group which contained people who wanted to conserve certain old things like the French language and culture and the British connection and which contained people with radical new ideas on federalism and advanced democracy , were able or willing to work together to bring into being the new confederation . 
the short answer which has meaning for us today is that the conservers of the old and the advocates of the new learned to bear with one another and to recognize each in the other the necessary complement of their one - sidedness . 
the defenders of the old need the challenge of new ideas . 
if they do not have that the old ossifies and eventually decays . 
the advocates of change need the influence of the advocates of old principles to constrain them from going too far . 
if the two can ever bear with one another , one of the products of their doing that at the turn of the last century was the country of Canada itself . 
i invite all Canadians who share in their hearts a vision of a better Canada where taxes are lower and government less intrusive ; where law and order and the value of the family are enhanced rather than undermined by federal policy ; where federal and provincial governments co - operate rather than bicker in a better federal union to provide better health , education and social services for our people ; and where federal political institutions like the Senate and the House command a new respect because of their effectiveness and commitment to democratic accountability to work together . 
i invite all who share in this vision and the principles on which it rests to work together to remedy the deficiencies in principle and vision that characterize this last gasp throne speech from a tired and visionless administration . 
in the meantime I move that the following words be added to the address : 
and that this House regrets that your Government has failed through a lack of vision and commitment to sound principles to adequately address the allegations of corruption against it , including the abuse of patronage ; failed to bring integrity to Canada ' s immigration system by allowing organized crime to take advantage of Canadians ' generosity and by undermining the standing of legitimate immigrants and genuine refugees ; failed to seriously deal with the problems of drug trafficking , youth crime , and child pornography ; rejected the common sense policies of other governments , most notably the Ontario and Alberta Governments , of lowering taxes to create jobs and prevent companies , young people , and capital from leaving the country ; failed to maintain the supremacy of Parliament in relation to the court ; failed to recognize the serious plight of Canadian agriculture and to provide a framework for reorganizing the airline industry ; failed to provide for the democratic reform of federal institutions and the reform of federal - provincial relations through the rebalancing of powers ; and therefore , having failed to demonstrate the capacity , commitment , and vision required to lead this country into the 21 st century , has lost the confidence of this House and the Canadian people . 
the Speaker : 
the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is in order . 
debate is on the amendment . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I begin my remarks today by congratulating the hon. member for Windsor - St. 
Clair on the excellent speech he made in moving the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
i would also like to congratulate the member for Laval West , who also made an excellent presentation in seconding the address yesterday . 
i was very impressed by their presentations and I am sure that they will have a fine career here in the Parliament of Canada . 
on behalf of all members of the House I congratulate Her Excellency on assuming her functions as governor general . 
we all wish her well . 
today we are on the eve of what many predict will be the century of the Pacific . 
one hundred years ago who would have predicted that a woman immigrant from China would one day become Governor General of Canada ? 
it is with great pride that I say we have come a long , long way in this wonderful country . 
we are now 75 days from the turn of a new century . 
it has been said that Canada is a triumph of will over geography and economics , and what a triumph it has been . 
how easy it would have been for a small population , spread over vast spaces across the entire continent , to succumb to the forces of manifest destiny . 
but succumb we did not . 
we grew and we flourished . 
how easy it would have been for a small French speaking population , concentrated on the banks of the St. Lawrence , to succumb to the forces of the English speaking North American melting pot . 
but succumb we did not . 
we grew and we flourished . 
how easy it would have been for our first citizens , the aboriginal people , to succumb to the forces of assimilation . 
but succumb they did not , and a new relationship is growing and flourishing . 
in a century of tyranny Canadians gave their lives in the far corners of the world so that others could live in freedom . 
today I would like to pay tribute to the troops who are all over the world at this moment working for peace . 
in a century of intolerance Canada became a beacon of freedom . 
in a century of brutal dictatorships Canada became an advanced pluralistic democracy . 
in a century of the worst excesses of nationalism Canada became a multicultural post - national society . 
in a century of human rights oppression Canada embraced a charter of rights and freedoms . 
in a century of growing gaps between the haves and have nots Canada developed an advanced system of social security and a social safety net . 
in a century of great economic progress , from the small agrarian society that it was , Canada has become one of the seven great industrialized countries . 
in a century of entrepreneurship and innovation , Canada has been at the forefront . 
we Canadians have proven to be a very determined people . 
it is a balance that promotes individual freedom and economic prosperity while , at the same time , sharing risks and benefits . 
the world has sat up and noticed . 
the world values what we have accomplished . 
it wants us to succeed . 
and succeed we have , and succeed we will . 
we will build on our strengths . 
we will take bold action for the future . 
the Canadian way will be a model , setting standards for the whole world . 
we all know that there are some in Canada who will judge the success of countries solely by how much money they can make . 
ironically , many of those who today judge us harshly on our economic policy have actually made a great deal of money in Canada . 
that is certainly not the only criterion for judging success , nor should it be the only criterion for governing . 
life is about more than just making money . 
there may be other countries that are better for those who are already very well off . 
i am not sure , but there may be . 
however , if I have to choose between decisions that make life better for those in the middle and for those who have less or decisions for those who already have a great deal , I know how I choose . 
i know how this government chooses and I know how Canadians choose . 
we choose the Canadian way . 
we have every reason to be very proud of what we have accomplished . 
we have every reason to be full of hope , of confidence and optimism for the future . 
that does not mean that everything in Canada is as it should be for everyone . It is not . 
that does not mean that everything is as it can be and must be for everyone . It is not . 
there is a lot of room for rolling up our sleeves , looking forward and working harder together . 
we have much work left to do , not only for this parliament but for the next parliament as well . 
with an appreciation for our past , boldness of vision and the courage to act , we can take what is clearly the best country in the world in which to live and make it better for everyone . 
our vision of the Canada of the 21 st century is clear : a society of excellence with a commitment to success , a strong and united country , a dynamic economy , a creative and innovative population , a diverse and cohesive society where prosperity is not limited to the few , but is shared by many . 
it is a Canada where every child gets the right start in life , where young people have a chance to grow and be the best at whatever they want to do , where citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to excel . 
it is a Canada where citizens , regardless of income , receive quality health services , where families enjoy safe communities and a clean environment and where we work together with other countries to promote peace , cultural diversity and the human purpose and benefits of the new global economy . 
it is a country , Canada , that is the place to be in the 21 st century , the place where people want to come and stay , to learn , to pursue opportunities , to raise children , to enjoy natural beauty , to open new frontiers and to set the standard for the world for a high quality of life . 
it is a Canada that is a leader and an example to the world . 
we must set ambitious , concrete objectives , and work with Canadians to achieve them . 
that is what leadership is really about . 
that is why the government is setting out both five - year objectives and concrete steps over the next two years to achieve them . 
above all , a strong economy is the indispensable foundation for all we can do and all we want to do . 
the government ' s economic strategy is clear and comprehensive ; it is to make Canada a world leader in the next century . 
when we took office six years ago , we had a plan . 
and we will continue to follow it . 
we are now in a position to build on it by setting ambitious new goals and objectives for the next five years . 
we have to build a common vision of how Canada will take on the world , and win , in the 21 st century . 
we have to think globally . 
we have to brand Canada , at home and abroad , as a dynamic and skilled knowledge - based economy . 
and we must do these things faster than our global competitors , because speed wins . 
but to compete on an equal footing , we first had to restore the country ' s fiscal health . 
the era of growing debt and large deficits is now behind us once and for all . 
in each and every year , instead of adding to the national debt , we will pay it down . 
the debt to GDP ratio will decrease year after year , after year . 
the economy is growing strongly and sustainably . 
Canadians are more optimistic about the economy and their individual prospects today than they have been for a long , long time . 
i want to express to him my personal gratitude as Prime Minister , the gratitude of his colleagues in caucus and cabinet , and that of all Canadians . 
with the fiscal house in order , with the strong and growing economy , we can move forward boldly to implement our economic strategy , to strengthen the economic and social fabric of Canada and to seize the opportunities of a new century . 
the government , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Finance and the Liberal Party have been and are committed to reducing taxes as the finance of the nation improves . 
we have already started and we will carry on . 
but lower taxes are not an end in themselves . 
they are an essential part of an economic strategy to provide jobs , growth , rising incomes and a higher quality of life . 
we began targeted tax relief even before the budget was balanced . 
as soon as the books were balanced the Minister of Finance introduced broad based tax relief . 
the budgets of 1998 and 1999 have together cut taxes by $ 16.5 billion over a three year period . 
now we will do more in a responsible and sustained way , year after year after year . 
with continuing improvements in the financial health of the nation we will do more to reduce taxes in the years ahead . 
in the next budget the Minister of Finance will outline a multi - year tax reduction strategy to ensure that Canadian families have more income in their pockets than they had when we started as government , and that Canadian businesses are better able to compete in the global knowledge based economy . 
tax reduction is only one part of the equation . 
a comprehensive , balanced economic strategy requires investment , public and private , in children , knowledge , creativity , innovation , health and the environment . 
it also requires maintaining flexibility to meet urgent needs such as the problems in agriculture today in western Canada . 
i hope people will note that . 
this government committed itself at the beginning of this mandate to using 50 % of any surplus for tax and debt reduction and the other 50 % for investment in economic and social needs that will increase our quality of life over the long term . 
there is a growing Canadian consensus that this is the right approach , that this balanced approach is the Canadian way . 
in August in Quebec City we saw agreement on that from Tory premiers from the west and from Atlantic Canada . 
the NDP governments were there as were Mike Harris and Lucien Bouchard . 
in fact , Premier Harris read from the red book . 
he saw that as real common sense and that is why he approved of it . 
i do not blame him . 
i applaud him . 
he has to like it . 
our comprehensive strategy to make Canada the place to be in the 21 st century means focusing on children , on knowledge , on youth , on health and on the environment . 
the best place to start is with Canada ' s children . 
if we want the brightest future possible for our country , we must ensure that all our children have the best possible start in life . 
real support for Canadian families in the Canadian way . 
let me elaborate on three aspects of our strategy . 
there is now overwhelming scientific evidence that success in a child ' s early years is the key to long term healthy development . 
nothing is more important than for parents to be able to spend the maximum amount of time with newborn children in the critical early months of a child ' s life . 
therefore , I am proud to announce today that the government will introduce legislation in this parliament to extend employment insurance maternity and parental benefits from the current maximum of six months to one full year . 
we will make these benefits more flexible to meet the different needs of families . 
we will make them more accessible by increasing the number of parents eligible for support . 
together with the provinces , we have begun to put in place the national children ' s agenda to improve supports for families and children . 
i believe this work has to be accelerated . 
provincial premiers think so as well and discussed this last summer . 
we must move as quickly as possible from talk to action . 
we have demonstrated over the last three years that federal and provincial governments can work together to help families with children . 
the national child benefit is an outstanding example of federal - provincial collaboration . 
we must now continue toward our goal that parents will no longer have to choose between a job and benefits for their children . 
too often , we have seen people turn down jobs because they might lose their government benefits . 
under the system we have introduced , in collaboration with provincial governments , people are motivated to keep their job because they are not penalized for working , as they were in the past . 
we will therefore - and this is very important - make a third significant investment in the national child benefit for low income families with children , to be in place no later than July 1 , 2001 . 
and we will seek a commitment from the provinces , who have all asked for this further federal contribution , to build on our investment by increasing their own investments in early childhood development . 
in a country as prosperous as ours , senior Canadians should not be denied the security and dignity of an income . 
we did not build our system of old age security and public pensions overnight . 
but we focused on our goal and , by and large , we succeeded . 
what kind of world will these children live in ? 
well , we can see it already . 
and we can also see how they will succeed . 
we enter a new century at a time of rapid change , the scope and speed of which the world has never seen . 
it was a Canadian , Marshall McCluhan , who coined the phrase " global village '' . 
our researchers no longer compete with each other ; they are in competition every day with the whole world . 
our industries no longer compete locally ; they compete globally . 
globalization and technology have redefined the concept of the marketplace . 
this has a major implication for public policy . 
to seize the opportunities of the new knowledge based economy requires a comprehensive and ambitious strategy . 
we have begun this in the last six years . 
our goal is for Canada to be known around the world as the place to be , the place of exciting opportunities . 
the knowledge based industries which will provide the jobs of the future require access to a diverse range of skills close at hand to support them . 
this is much easier for a large country like the United States to achieve than it is for a relatively small country like Canada . 
over the years through the granting councils , the Medical Research Council , the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council , the Government of Canada has been far and away the largest contributor to university research in our country . 
in recent years the granting councils have contributed to the pursuit of excellence by creating and supporting hundreds of research chairs in our universities . 
they are now prepared to build on what they have already begun . 
the heads of the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for Innovation , working with some university presidents , in particular Dr. Robert Lacroix , the rector of the Universit é de Montr é al , and Dr. Martha Piper , the president of UBC , have come to the government with an exciting and ambitious proposal . 
they want to build on existing partnerships between our universities , the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for Innovation , to brand Canada around the world as the place to be for knowledge creation as we enter the 21 st century , to enable Canadian universities to create outstanding research opportunities for the best and brightest Canadians . 
it is a plan for brain gain , not brain drain . 
they have proposed a plan to establish over the next three years 1,200 new 21 st century chairs for research excellence in universities across Canada . 
they want to provide enough financial support for the total costs of research for each new research chair to make them internationally competitive and to set as an objective reaching a total of 2,000 new chairs for research excellence across Canada as soon as possible thereafter . 
it is a plan I welcome and we welcome on this side of the House . 
it is a plan for excellence and international competitiveness which the government endorses enthusiastically . 
we will provide the required funding to the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for Innovation . 
this is not all . 
with the Canada millennium scholarship fund , the Canada Foundation for Innovation , the 21 st century chairs for research excellence and the Canadian institutes of health research , the government is putting in place a sweeping and comprehensive strategy for putting Canada in the forefront of the knowledge based economy of the 21 st century . 
getting Canadians connected , to each other , to schools and libraries , to our diverse stories and voices , to government , to the marketplace and to the world , is one of the key elements in establishing Canada as a world leading economy and as a country of opportunity . 
we must aim to be the most connected country in the world , a country which uses these connections in a dynamic and original way . 
our goal is to make Canada a world leader in the smart use of electronic ways of doing business and to encourage the rapid use of e - commerce throughout the economy . 
today , I challenge all sectors of our country , private and public , government and business , to work together toward the goal of capturing 5 % of the world share of e - commerce for Canada by the year 2003 , and to do over $ 200 billion of business in this way . 
by 2004 , our goal is to be the most electronically connected government in the world to its citizens , so that Canadians can access all government information and services on - line at the time and place of their choosing . 
our success in the future will as never before depend on a population committed to learning , adapting to change , at ease with new technologies and the digital economy , and able to master new media . 
our ability to continue to lead in the world demands a commitment to ensuring that young Canadians have opportunities to acquire direct experience in these areas . 
to ensure they have the skills required to use new information technology , we will recruit up to 10,000 young Canadians to train community members of all ages . 
the quality of our lives and the future strength of our society require a new generation of Canadians who have the skills of citizenship and leadership , who understand themselves and their country , and who are open to the world . 
in collaboration with the voluntary sector the government will create a single window service called Exchanges Canada to give 100,000 young Canadians every year the chance to learn about another part of Canada , to live and experience another culture and language . 
to develop projects in the arts , sports , science and community development , the development and maintenance of a strong basic infrastructure as well as a knowledge infrastructure are also key components of a competitive economy for the 21 st century . 
the environment , water and air quality , public health , tourism , transportation , telecommunications and cultural infrastructure must be well planned to meet the needs of a modern economy in urban Canada and in rural Canada . 
it will require partnership , federal , provincial , municipal and the private sector . 
therefore we will seek to reach an agreement with our provincial and municipal partners by no later than the end of next year to begin in 2001 , or before if possible , a five year modern national infrastructure program for Canada . 
in the new global economy a healthy environment and high quality of life go hand in hand . 
this is a matter of very high priority for the government . 
the environment is of importance to all Canadians and particularly to young Canadians . 
our generation will be judged on the environmental legacy we leave to our children and grandchildren . 
legislation will be introduced in this session of parliament to protect species at risk and their critical habitat . 
we will continue to extend Canada ' s national parks system . 
we will clean up contaminated sites in the country and protect the health of Canadians . 
canada enters the next century with enormous advantages . 
in an era of globalization we are a multicultural society whose people have roots in almost every country of the world . 
we are an Atlantic , a Pacific and an Arctic country . 
we belong both to the Commonwealth and to the Francophonie . 
as such we are well placed to promote human security and cultural diversity . 
we have earned a respected place in the world community . 
over the last six years we have taken significant initiatives to help achieve shared international objectives like the land mines treaty and the International Criminal Court . 
we participated very actively at the beginning in the former Yugoslavia , in Bosnia and in Kosovo . 
we took a leadership role in Haiti and now we are in East Timor . 
our objective is to make a difference by using our ingenuity , the history of our international achievements and the respect with which Canada is held in the world to make progress on the human security agenda and to recognize that in a difficult world there will always be more progress to be made . 
we are a very fortunate country . 
we are an affluent country . 
we have an obligation to do our part to help those who are very poor . 
this is our obligation to our fellow human beings . 
the foreign policy through which we project our values , coupled with the trade oriented economy and vigorous promotion of trade and investment interests , will make Canada very well positioned for the global economy of the 21 st century . 
this afternoon I have spoken about the country that we are so proud of , the country that we have built so well in the 20 th century . 
today I have set out a comprehensive strategy for Canadian leadership in the knowledge - based economy and for promoting our interests and projecting our values in the world , a vision for the Canada of the 21 st century and a plan to achieve it , a vision of the Canadian model , a modern project of a society , the project of a forward - looking country . 
these are not old solutions to the problems of today , but new plans to meet new opportunities . 
1745 
it is a strategy for the future for a country of the future , a country that is open to the world and willing to lead . 
Canadians are not a boastful people . 
we are not given to flag waving or emotional excesses . 
in a century , indeed in a millennium , that has seen so much bloodshed over differences of faith , race and nationality , perhaps that is a good thing . 
instead , with quiet confidence we have adopted a Canadian way of living together , resolving differences , reasoning together and creating what is quite simply the best country in the world in which to live . 
i began today by referring to the famous remark of Sir Wilfrid Laurier about the 20 th century belonging to Canada . 
the world has seen the future and it is Canada . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , some weeks ago , the throne speech was being touted as the opportunity for the Prime Minister to demonstrate a vision of Canada for the 21 st century , as we enter a new millennium . 
instead of a vision , we have an invasion . 
for Quebec this throne speech is fraught with meaning and with consequences . 
this prime ministerial vision of the future is one of a Canada that excludes Quebec , that thumbs its nose at Quebec ' s concerns and traditional demands . 
the Prime Minister is now putting into practice his famous statement made just before the last election in Quebec " The general store is now closed '' . 
with this throne speech , the federal government is slamming the door closed on all the commitments toward Quebec that were made leading up to the 1995 referendum . 
there is also a message for all Quebec federalists in this speech : this is the end of renewed federalism , of Quebec ' s traditional demands , this is the end of the concept of founding people , of distinct character , all those formulas that were found in an attempt to renew Canadian federalism . 
from now on everything is clear : one country , one people , one government . 
Mr. Dumont and Mr. Charest have made it clear that they would not have signed it either . 
in the throne speech , the federal government indicated both its intention to work in collaboration with its partners and its intention to do without their approval . 
where exactly does this leave us ? 
the answer is blatantly obvious when we read the Speech from the Throne . 
let me quote an extract from it from page 5 . 
the speech talks of national will , of national strategies and of the partnerships across the country that are required . 
that are required - that is the word , the essence of the Speech from the Throne . 
how will federal government go about achieving this ? 
it tells us that it is going to establish standards of its choosing , since it is omnipotent . 
the government talks about operating on the basis of the social union agreement . 
what does this agreement on social union say ? 
there is discussion , but if no agreement is reached , the federal government - Ottawa knows best - announces three months in advance that it will intervene in areas of provincial jurisdiction where direct services are provided to the public , and the provinces are requested to take note . 
this is what Ottawa calls partnerships . 
in what areas will it impose its standards and set up its programs ? 
national defence or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or air transportation come to mind . 
there is no shortage of problems in these sectors , which are under federal jurisdiction . 
the federal government could ensure pay equity in its own public service or correct the huge injustices caused by the employment insurance reform , which is nothing more than government robbery on the backs of society ' s most disadvantaged . 
in fact , this afternoon the Prime Minister could not deny that , under the social union and the unjustified barriers to mobility , he could take action regarding Bill 101 , regarding the language of work in Quebec . 
this is serious stuff . 
it jeopardizes a vital prerogative in Quebec . 
the Prime Minister also talks about getting involved in Quebec ' s environmental sector , as if his government had lived up to its commitments in its own jurisdictions , including air pollution . 
the government talks about justice . 
it claims that it will reform family law . 
does it intend to tamper with the Civil Code , which is the foundation of the Quebec law and an exclusive Quebec jurisdiction , as was the case even before the Constitution , in 1867 ? 
on page 23 , the government reiterates its intention to impose a repressive act on young offenders , an act that no one in Quebec wants . 
the government is prepared to sacrifice the future of hundreds of young Quebecers to gain a few votes in western Canada . 
this issue does not fall under its jurisdiction . 
the government could have acted through the Criminal Code , it could have taken action against organized crime , which is corrupting our young people and our economic institutions , both in Quebec and across the country , which is going after farmers , and which has even targeted my colleague from Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot . 
it could have tabled anti - gang legislation . 
but there is not one word about the fight against criminals . 
yet , in order to get some votes in western Canada , the government does not hesitate to jeopardize Quebec ' s rehabilitation program for young offenders . 
this is an unacceptable , shameful and cowardly attitude . 
the government also talks about families and young children . 
it now wants to help families and children after having drastically cut employment insurance , health , education and income support . 
the government wants to impose , and I am quoting from page 7 , " common principles , objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments '' . 
this government is so arrogant that it is trying to impose policy by stating that the provinces , and Quebec is in the forefront with its exemplary policies on daycare and early childhood , will be able to provide additional services in their own areas of jurisdiction . 
it takes no little arrogance , indeed a lot of it , to say that the provinces will nevertheless be entitled , in their fields of jurisdiction , to propose policy that is complementary to that decided here in Ottawa . 
in the cultural sector , the federal government mentions Quebec only once . 
we will see later on that it is in order to threaten it . 
otherwise , nothing . 
as if Quebec and Quebec culture did not exist . 
the government has announced a whole series of new cultural programs , but it is also promising an approach that it calls encompassing for national unity . 
that is totally crazy , but I know just how much that inspires the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
the government talks about the environment as well . 
however , this government ' s performance in this area is disastrous . 
it has failed to achieve the very modest objectives it set for itself in Kyoto . 
it refuses to sign the protocol on biodiversity that 140 countries have already signed . 
so much for the federal government ' s jurisdictions . 
what is it doing ? 
well , once again in the provinces ' jurisdictions it will try to impose bills and programs on endangered species and habitats , two areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
this government , from one end of the speech to the other , is ignoring the existence of Quebec and making a mockery of its powers . 
a head - on collision is in the works . 
plan A is not just being ended , it is being buried . 
when I speak of head - on collision , I refer particularly to the area of education . 
naturally , nowhere in the text of the speech does the word education appear . 
i am sure the thesaurus was well used in the writing of this text . 
it probably refers to agriculture when using those terms . 
Ottawa is therefore announcing a national plan related to skills and learning for the 21 st century , with a one - stop entry point , one marked " made in Ottawa '' . 
this means that Ottawa is announcing no more and no less than a national policy for education , a provincial area of jurisdiction if ever there was one , one that has been recognized as exclusive to them since this country began back in 1867 . 
a vision of the future ? 
more of a systematic invasion plan into areas of provincial jurisdiction , with or without the provinces ' consent . 
this means the end of Plan A , but it gives a good idea of what Plan B will or may be , thus leaving Quebec with the sword of Damocles hanging over its head . 
there is of course reference to the referendum process , to rules of clarity . 
as far as the rule of 50 % plus one is concerned , which is a democratic rule recognized even here in Canada , it seems to me that this ought to be clear . 
there cannot be two rules , one for Newfoundland , where it was 50 % plus one , and where the outcome was just a touch above 52 % after two referendums , and another rule for Quebec in a third referendum , whereas in the first two , where the federal government was involved , it was 50 % plus one . 
it is a pretty strange game when one player wants to change the rules partway through . 
as for the matter of the referendum question itself , that is a prerogative of the National Assembly . 
i would remind you that , right before the last referendum , the Prime Minister himself said " The question is clear . 
if you vote no , you stay in Canada . 
vote yes , and you leave Canada . " 
i would submit that if the Prime Minister understood it , then everybody understood it . 
in conclusion , as far as plan B is concerned , although I am not sure that is what it should be called since there is no longer a Plan A , I would say that the government ought to start by applying to itself the clarity it demands of others . 
it will have to tell us clearly whether it intends to honour a majority that is democratic and recognized by the people of Quebec in a referendum and whether it intends to negotiate with Quebec , as the supreme court requires it to do , the terms of its departure from the federation . 
there is a significant imbalance . 
the Speech from the Throne should have served as the government ' s opportunity to make a solemn commitment in this regard . 
however , we got simply a vague promise that there may be something in the upcoming budget without anything specific being indicated . 
so it is very vague , wishful thinking , general remarks . 
we were promised vision , we got repetition , and especially no specific action in order to ensure and develop Canadians ' quality of life . 
this theme of the Canadians ' quality of life appears as a leitmotif throughout the throne speech , as if it only needed repeating in order to convince Canadians and Quebecers that they live in the best country in the world , as the Prime Minister puts it . 
it also includes income support . 
in this area , the provinces provide the services to the public . 
and herein lies the contradiction in this country of Canada in which , on the one hand , those who provide direct services to the public do not have the means to do so and , on the other , the government that does not provide these direct services has all the money in its pockets . 
herein lies the contradiction . 
one would expect the government , which will have cut $ 33 billion between 1994 and 2004 , to restore transfer payments to the provinces , precisely to improve health and education services . 
the only thing one sees is the old Liberal habit of getting involved in provincial jurisdictions as soon as they have money . 
the government is now promising a pharmacare plan , something which already exists in Quebec , homecare and help for families and young children , instead of giving back the money to those who provide the direct services to help them fulfil their responsibilities . 
the federal government is collecting too much money , given its own jurisdictions . 
it is more than an imbalance , it is a profound injustice , a major dysfunction in the federal system . 
this imbalance leads the federal government to establish new programs to gain greater political visibility . 
this is the whole issue . 
the Liberals see the federal government as the major league . 
to them , the provinces are mere junior partners they consult when they see fit to do so and on whom they impose their will , with money taken from the citizens of those provinces , and often from budgets that should have been given to these provinces . 
as I said earlier , the federal government is not proposing anything to correct the major flaws in employment insurance . 
indeed , 60 % of those who contribute to the program are not eligible for benefits if they become unemployed . 
this is highway robbery . 
an insurance agent who behaved like the Prime Minister and the Minister of Human Resources Development would be taken to court and at risk of being sent to jail . 
this is fraud , no more and no less . 
people were expecting tax cuts for middle income families . 
nothing , once again . 
nothing about re - establishing transfer payments . 
might people not realize that there are far more poor children since this government has been in power ? 
it seems to me this is easy to understand . 
perhaps there would be less visibility but greater responsibility . 
let us look at problems of immediate concern to the government , for instance air transportation . 
at the present time , there are between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs at stake , in Quebec in particular . 
does the buddy - buddy relationship between certain members of government and the main stakeholders in this matter have anything to do with this ? 
there is nothing about shipbuilding either , yet the Bloc Quebecois had made some proposals , supported by the other three opposition parties , for a serious and rigorous shipbuilding policy . 
on the other side they are constantly boasting about this country reaching from sea to sea to sea - three oceans but no shipbuilding policy . 
they do not have much imagination . 
all of the premiers who met together in Quebec City last August supported the shipbuilding policy we proposed . 
yet there is no reference to it in this Speech from the Throne . 
and what about the situation of aboriginal people and the fisheries issue ? 
there is a mess in both cases , and now the two messes are combining into one big one . 
there is a major crisis and even if one reads this speech from start to finish , there is nothing to be found about this problem . 
i am thinking of mobility , - because we heard about mobility for citizens and students , - and because we are required to eliminate unjustified barriers to that mobility . 
can we expect to see the federal government blunder into this sector ? 
and can we expect it to meddle in the loans and scholarships issue ? 
we were told that someone should look into all the people from Vancouver who go to Montreal , and all the people from Montreal who go to Vancouver . 
come on . 
as for language of work , is Bill 101 a barrier to mobility ? 
your guess is as good as ours . 
it is to weep . 
i knew that the ambassadors have their little question and answer books , but now the Prime Minister and his ministers will be able to spread the good word throughout the country . 
it could go something like this : 
where is Ottawa ? 
Ottawa is everywhere . 
why is Ottawa everywhere ? 
because it has money . 
why does Ottawa have money ? 
because it made extensive cuts . 
what does Ottawa do with its money ? 
it does wonderful things and establishes new programs everywhere in order to enhance its visibility . 
this sounds silly , but it gives the idea . 
obviously , this government has too much money for its areas of jurisdiction , views the provinces as mere intendants , and denies the existence of the Quebec culture and people . 
therefore , I move : 
that the amendment be amended by adding , between the words " powers " and " ; and therefore '' , the following : 
" , especially by failing to recognize the existence of the Quebec people ; failed to carry out its responsibilities in the area of social welfare by not re - establishing transfer payments for programs relating to healthcare , postsecondary education and social assistance , while maintaining an inequitable and unjust employment insurance scheme '' . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it occurs to me that this afternoon ' s speech by the Prime Minister is one of the more revealing deathbed repentances I have ever witnessed in my 20 years in political life . 
after so many years of the federal Liberal government tearing down , backing away from commitments and creating crises for many Canadians and many Canadian communities , what we heard from the Prime Minister this afternoon was potentially very good news , and I say that quite sincerely . 
it is also a reminder of why it serves Canadians well to have sufficient numbers of New Democrats back in parliament to be able to push back against that reform dominance of the federal Liberal government ' s efforts over the last six years . 
on that very positive note I welcome the opportunity to enter the debate this afternoon on the throne speech that we heard yesterday . 
the throne speech is an important opportunity for members of parliament to speak about their own constituencies . 
i am immensely grateful for the privilege my constituents have bestowed upon me and for the trust they have placed in me . 
i take that trust very seriously . 
i believe that it is my responsibility to gain and regain that trust each and every day I have the privilege to remain in office and to serve as their representative in the House of Commons . 
the throne speech offers members an opportunity to note some of the particular contributions one ' s constituents have made to one ' s community and province . 
i will say a few words this afternoon about the sadness I feel , and I know the great sadness that many Canadians feel , about the recent deaths over the last 10 days of three very distinguished Canadians , Nova Scotians who have contributed enormously to the life of my province . 
one was the long serving conductor of the Atlantic Symphony and more recently the Nova Scotia Symphony , Georg Tintner . 
he was a marvellous man who came to Canada as a refugee . 
he created joy and harmony in the community through the music that he contributed and through a wonderful philosophy on life . 
he was truly a leader who provided inspiration to all of us . 
second , I was very saddened to learn yesterday of the death of Reverend Donald Skeir , a leader in Nova Scotia and particularly on behalf of black Nova Scotians for over 40 years . 
he was someone whom I had the privilege of knowing personally and of observing his terrific commitment to creating harmonious race relations and advancing the status of black Nova Scotians . 
he will be sorely missed , but he has left a great legacy for all Nova Scotians . 
third , I was very saddened this morning to open my newspaper and find that Lee Creemo had passed away on the weekend as well . 
he will be known certainly to Nova Scotians who serve with me here in the House of Commons as a great Cape Bretoner , a wonderful Mi ' kmaw who also provided music that will long be remembered . 
he was a fiddler , a champion in Canada and internationally . 
he will be missed sorely . 
i want to express my condolences to his family and to his community of Eskasoni . 
i also want to take a few moments to speak about what for me have been several highlights in my past year . 
i will long remember them as among the most inspirational in my 20 years of political life . 
we have many things that we are privileged to participate in as members of parliament in our own communities and across the country . 
for me it was a privilege that I will never forget to have been present in Nunavut on April 1 , 1999 for the official launching of the newest member of the Canadian family , the territory of Nunavut . 
i was accompanied by my colleague from Churchill River who had many friendships and relationships over the years with some of those I had the privilege to meet while in Nunavut on that special occasion . 
i think it was one of the happiest and most promising things that happened in the past year . 
it really is a testament to the many years of patient , persistent struggle by Inuit Canadians in working toward a dream that would not only provide for some reconciliation after literally centuries , of 400 years of exploitation and hardship , but would serve as a model of what people can achieve if they come together , if they work together toward a dream that they share . 
it was indeed a privilege for me to be in attendance at that very exciting event . 
pier 21 will be known to many members of the House and certainly to millions of Canadians as the point of entry for over one million immigrants , many of them refugees , to Canada between the years of 1921 and 1973 . 
my colleague from Sackville - Eastern Shore is a member of one of the immigrant families that came through Pier 21 . 
that occasion was a wonderful celebration of the contributions immigrant Canadians have made to Canadian society over not just that period of 52 years during which many immigrants and refugees came through the Halifax harbour , but the past , present and continuing contributions of the millions of immigrants and refugees who have come to Canada throughout all of our history . 
pier 21 is a very important living , breathing memorial to the contribution immigrants have made . 
it is a very timely reminder of that important immigrant history and that reality in Canada at a time when there have been some very unhappy sentiments aroused and fears generated around the arrival of Chinese refugees on our shores over the last several months . 
we have seen less than a welcoming , compassionate response to the plight of many of those people who in some cases are young children who have been exploited by a criminal element for reasons of profiteering . 
we need to be very much on guard against the kind of fearmongering that has been generated toward many of those exploited and desperate people . 
i attended it because that is one of the things one does as a member of parliament . 
i want to take this occasion to say that I found it to be a tremendously inspirational event . 
i believe the speech delivered by Canada ' s newest Governor General on that occasion was a great moment for Canada . 
what we saw in the vision put forward by Canada ' s newest Governor General was one that will be long remembered . 
we would all do well to keep in mind the very powerful message she delivered about how there are two kinds of societies in this world , forgiving societies and punishing societies . 
she urged that Canada always remain and continue to strive to be a forgiving society in every sense of the word . 
i think it is the same concept . 
sometimes we do not build enough on those positive images as we try to go about dealing with the major challenges we face in contemporary political life . 
it struck me that it was somewhat ironic , in a way a sad irony , but also a telling disappointment that a woman who came to Canada as a refugee , who has never held political office in this country and who has never to my knowledge sought political office nevertheless was able to put forward in her speech to Canadians last week a more compelling vision for the future of Canada , a more profound appreciation of Canadian history and Canadian culture and a better grasp of the challenges that we face in this country today than the current Prime Minister who has actually held office for over 30 years , and the current government that by my calculation has actually been in power in the country for 63 years during this century . 
like all good literary references , I will again quote briefly from that book because it bears repeating : 
for a maritimer there is no question that references to the ocean , to the seaside , to our marine heritage are always very positive , particularly when one comes from a riding where so much of the way of life depends on our proximity to the ocean . 
there is shipbuilding , shipping , our naval history , marine related industries and so on , and of course fishing . 
it occurred to me that maybe part of the problem with the lack of vision from the government and the Prime Minister is the fact that he spends too much time on landlocked golf courses and not enough time beside the sea where he could gain the kind of inspiration that is very much needed today in public office . 
nevertheless , the Prime Minister has made it clear that he intends to remain at the helm . 
some of his colleagues would say it would appear to be forever . 
it is certainly creating some difficulties and some manoeuvring below decks among his colleagues . 
but he has made it clear that he wants to continue to be at the helm . 
it is becoming something of a long running soap opera , not to be outdone by the continuing national soap opera between the Reform Party and the Conservative Party in trying to decide whether they want to be a divided alternative , a united alterative , or split off in three different directions . 
the Prime Minister wants to remain at the helm , but he is a bad captain . 
he has no vision and no idea of which direction to take . 
consequently , he relies on pollsters and uses taxpayers ' money to determine Canada ' s destinations for the 21 st century . 
in 1993 Canadians were told that if they put Liberals at the helm , they would launch a national child care program . 
the result is that hundreds of thousands of children and their families remain stranded when it comes to access to affordable , safe and quality child care . 
we were promised that we were on our way to home care so that families could care for their loved ones . 
we were promised that we were on our way to pharmacare so that families without drug plans could cope with inflated prescription drug costs . 
that ship has not even set sail . 
no wonder Canadians do not believe that Liberals can be trusted to keep their promises that have been set out in the throne speech . 
liberals pretend to care about our children . 
they talk in the throne speech about the importance of the early years of a child ' s life , to his or her own well - being . 
i want to say that we welcome the Prime Minister ' s announcement this afternoon of extending parental leave and maternity benefits . 
i congratulate my colleagues from Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton and Acadie - Bathurst for having worked strenuously to achieve that kind of commitment from the government . 
the question is what has the government actually done about children who are living in grinding poverty in this country ? 
there were close to one million children living in poverty already when this Prime Minister came to office . 
what has the government done ? 
it has added 500,000 more children to the ranks of poverty in Canada . 
when did the Liberal government decide that 1.5 million poor kids do not count in this country ? 
the throne speech shows clearly that the Liberal government has no intention of acting to help our young people gain access to the higher education they need . 
the Liberals ' laissez - faire attitude means more debt for our young people and more profits for the banks that finance their education . 
could it be that the government does not care about young people ? 
when did the government decide that farm children and farm communities did not count ? 
there was not a word in the throne speech about the upheaval in families and communities in Cape Breton that are facing the shutdown of the coal mining industry or those who are facing uncertain futures in the steel industry . 
when did the government decide that the families in those communities do not count ? 
the government pretends that it cares about Canada ' s physical infrastructure . Yet we are experiencing a severe crisis with respect to the future of our airline industry . 
the Speaker : 
i think we might have a solution to continuing a bit longer . 
we have just a few more minutes and I will go to questions and comments . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to pose a question to my leader , the member for Halifax , pertaining to the very difficult economic situation facing many families and communities everywhere in the country . 
i would like to ask the member to respond to what is in the Speech from the Throne for that situation and what solutions she sees . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , I think we have already heard that a number of Canadian families have been completely ignored by the government . 
let me speak about the complete lack of leadership by the government with respect to those who do not have a family with whom they can find a home , with whom they are able to live , the homeless . 
we have watched the government completely abandon any responsibility to put in place a national housing strategy , the only industrial nation in the world which does not have a national housing strategy . 
when did the government decide that the homeless did not count ? 
one of the most important principles of the recommendations in that commission ' s report was that treaty rights should be negotiated , not litigated . 
yet it is the lack of leadership by the government which has driven many aboriginal people into the courts to seek justice and to seek their rights . 
the result is that many tensions have been created by a government absolutely not prepared to provide any leadership in dealing with the inevitability of finally addressing treaty rights long overdue and disregarded . 
later this evening we are to have a take note debate on some of the tensions created in the fishery industry . 
again it is important to note that the Union of Nova Scotia Indians began to provide leadership six months ago on April 29 around the failure of the federal government to address what kinds of tensions would be created by a favourable decision on the Marshall case when it came before the supreme court . 
we now have to repair the damage done by that lack of leadership . 
there are many other areas in which the government has disregarded its responsibility to provide leadership . 
the government says that it cares about the environment all of a sudden , and thank goodness it is back on the agenda . 
however , let me say that it is very difficult for Canadians to be confident that the government will deliver on any new commitments to the environment when it has done nothing to put an end to the export of our most precious resource , our water . 
it has done nothing to address the concerns of communities in Ontario in speaking out against the importation of MOx plutonium , MOx fuel , with all the implications both short term and long term that holds for damage to our environment . 
having gutted the most important provisions and improvements to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , Canadians are wondering how they can trust the government to make a priority of the environment . 
we understand that politics is the lifeblood of a free and democratic society . 
the New Democratic Party absolutely believes in the importance of modernizing our electoral processes and our democratic institutions to ensure that they remain responsive , effective and accountable . 
the federal Liberal government has delivered many promises in its Speech from the Throne , but Canadians can be forgiven for not trusting the Liberals to deliver on those promises because of their dismal record of not doing so . 
my colleagues and I will use every opportunity available to us inside and outside of parliament to act on the concerns of ordinary Canadians to push the government to address the concerns of working people because we believe in a responsive , positive and proactive role for government . 
we believe in a vision for 21 st century Canada which includes the notion of political leadership not just by the federal government but by all levels of government working in effective partnerships with the private sector , the non - profit and co - operative sector , labour representatives , and primary producers for something that is bigger than ourselves . 
that is the legacy of my party ' s contribution to Canada . 
that is what inspired each and every one of my colleagues to seek public office and to represent our constituents and our communities as New Democrats . 
in conclusion , that is what will inspire our every move as we go about our work on behalf of our constituents . 
as Tommy Douglas once said , it is never too late to build a better world . 
let us get on with the task of working together on behalf of all constituents to build a better Canada and a better world as we go into the 21 st century . 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
we heard the leader of the NDP talk about the programs and the spending which the federal government plans to undertake . 
we also heard of some programs that she and her party would like to see added to that list . 
exactly how much higher would the leader of the New Democratic Party like to see Canadian taxes go ? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , that is a very unhelpful question which breeds much cynicism toward politics in a lot of Canadians who look at what goes on in parliament today with some distress . 
let me say very clearly that we believe the federal government or any government has a responsibility to act in a fiscally responsible manner . 
that is what the Reform Party stands for . 
that is why my party is very happy to be here with sufficient force to stand and not only push against the Reform Party agenda but finally begin to push the Liberal Party back toward a more responsible stand on some of these issues than the dominance it has had over its actions over last six years . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I begin on a congratulatory note . 
i extend my congratulations to all previous speakers and leaders . 
i also extend congratulations on behalf of the party to the new governor general , Madam Adrienne Clarkson , and offer our best wishes to the outgoing governor general , Mr. LeBlanc . 
some congratulations are also in order with respect to the Speech from the Throne which broadly and vaguely stated the government ' s willingness to look to the future . 
it is necessary to compliment the Liberal government for finally recognizing that the modern economy exists , for showing an awareness for the next century and for spending some time in the throne speech telling Canadians that new technologies will play a larger role in all our lives . 
these are penetrating statements of the obvious , yet it marks a shift in simply following the policies of a previous Conservative government and reaping the benefit of those visionary initiatives . 
we are on the verge of the 21 st century ; that is an undeniable fact . 
the Liberals acknowledge it , and that is encouraging . 
they may have taken six years to do so , but finally the government has taken the risk of stating that the country is in a period of transition and that there are a number of challenges ahead on the horizon . 
yet there is nothing in the Speech from the Throne that helps Canadians understand the direction in which the Liberals wish to steer Canada . 
nothing in the throne speech assures Canadians that the country is going in the right direction . 
the Speech from the Throne says nothing about all the complicated workings of governmental affairs . 
i compliment the government for making a grand gesture to the Canadian public yesterday , a gesture that exhibited supreme confidence in the future of the country and the ability of Canadians to respond to future challenges . 
unfortunately it was an empty and shallow gesture , one which offered no vision and no leadership . 
this was not a blueprint of where the country is headed . 
it was a pencil sketch or connect the dots . 
sadly it showed a government with no ideas , no focus and no sense of how we move the country forward , only vague notions of what the future might look like . 
Canadians want some serious issues addressed , issues like increasing the tax burden , the agricultural crisis in western Canada , the issue of immigration , or the consequences of a hostile takeover resulting in a single national airline . 
those looking for these issues to be addressed in the throne speech were sadly disappointed . 
there were a lot of right sounding words in the throne speech , words like knowledge economy , building a higher quality of life , technology and advancing Canada ' s place in the world . 
these are all important issues that this parliament will have to address , but beyond the catch phrases themselves there was nothing , nothing new and nothing that explains the purpose of the government . 
it is disheartening to see over the course of several months that the federal government failed to prepare itself for this new parliament , even with the three - week delay in the opening . 
it failed to meet the demands of Canadians for a responsible government and for the delivery of a vigorous new plan for this parliament . 
it has also failed to anticipate the Supreme Court decision in Marshall , the void that it would create and the chaos it would initiate . 
it is appropriate now to quote a respected Canadian philosopher , John Ralston Saul , who wrote : 
the modern tools of communication become the tools of propaganda . 
and fear of the consequences of non - conformity is propagated . 
this statement takes on a wonderful clarity and irony in the context of yesterday ' s throne speech . 
what was the meaning behind the promises we heard ? 
were they one line promises with little if any detail on how exactly these promises were to be implemented ? 
it was much like we have seen from previous throne speeches from the government . 
much of what we heard were ideas generated by the PC Party of Canada or ideas that have been long media tested , words that sound wonderful and warm people ' s hearts but do not amount to much . 
no one would deny that we need to improve our commitment on children ' s issues , to a stronger economy , to a quality health care , to aboriginal peoples amongst other issues . 
these we can all agree on but where were the details ? 
when can Canadians count on the government to explain its vision in a manner that provides answers rather than more questions ? 
we have heard much about the Liberal ' s concept of diversity . 
we heard it many times in yesterday ' s speech . 
how can the government speak of respecting diversity when it chooses to antagonize Quebec , when it chooses to antagonize Atlantic Canada , the west and other regions and when it chooses to antagonize every region of the country with alienating provocative approaches to federalism ? 
we need to encourage Canadians if we are to evolve as a strong and united country . 
when the government ignores the plight of western farmers or Atlantic fishers it shows that it respects diversity only when it falls within the Liberal agenda . 
it demonstrates that it is only a true crisis that evokes a response and even then the government responds slowly and inadequately . 
it is heartening to know that the government has finally recognized the priority that needs to be given to environmental issues , six years too late , I might add . 
and still the Liberals have done nothing more than to affirm and reaffirm Canada ' s commitment to the Kyoto protocols and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . 
the government speaks of a children ' s agenda but it has not taken any meaningful action to protect the environment in which our children will live . 
thankfully , some industries have stepped up the challenge and have taken meaningful steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to do so from their factories . 
others have not been so noble . 
the government needs to stop talking about the reduction of harmful greenhouse emissions and start meaningful implementation of those commitments . 
they continue to do so . 
they continue to be a part of Canada ' s overall economy despite Liberal government indifference . 
where on earth was the commitment to our brave men and women of the armed forces for equipment and resources to ensure their safety and success ? 
this glaring omission speaks volumes . 
within the pages of the speech there was a flavour of the abandonment of the past . 
while the push to the future is a noble ideal , we cannot forget the fact that our traditional industries continue to provide meaningful work in areas of high unemployment . 
the speech was littered with reaffirmations of previously unfulfilled promises or commitments . 
as a Maritime member , it becomes obvious that the lack of focus on significant industries will have a negative impact . 
it sends a message to Atlantic Canadians and others that they are not a high priority for the Liberal government . 
one only has to look at the results of the last federal election and two recent provincial elections in the Atlantic provinces to know how Atlantic Canadians react when ignored . 
when the Liberal government speaks of high technology and of the knowledge based economy bringing a higher quality of life to Canadians , it neglects to mention that the costs to the quality of life in our smaller communities amongst fishers , farmers and miners will be hurt . 
let us build a stronger future by encouraging and connecting Canadians from coast to coast . 
let us not disconnect from the important industries that continue to drive the economy . 
it is appropriate tonight that we in the House will be participating in a debate on the crisis emerging in the commercial fishing industry between native and non - native fishers . 
the government has tiptoed around this critical issue for weeks allowing it to fester and grow to the point of confrontation and violence . 
let us hope that the government uses tonight ' s debate as an opportunity to reset its priorities and focus on the necessity of finding a swift and long term resolution to this crisis . 
this must be an inclusive focus on consensus building and it must avoid the base political antagonism that has been practised by some . 
we have learned recently that aboriginal chiefs , including those who have until now supported the moratorium , have just left the meeting in New Brunswick and that the fisheries self - imposed moratorium is now off . 
this means that boats and traps will be put back in the water and there is a serious issue that needs to be addressed and addressed quickly . 
across the country other crises emerge . 
the crisis faced by the western farm families went literally and figuratively unnoticed in yesterday ' s throne speech . 
the low agricultural prices caused by subsidies among our trading partners threatens to put many Canadian farmers out of business completely . 
this issue needs government action before it is too late . 
there is nothing in the throne speech that will stem the brain drain . 
far too many young Canadians are forced to move away from home and family depriving their communities of the knowledge and the skills necessary to build a strong foundation for the country in the 21 st century . 
we cannot wait for more Centres of Excellence to be established and more implementations of millennium scholarships . 
we can do more than simply applaud the government ' s commitment to a free trade arena or area of the Americas by the year 2005 . 
we can do that but it is finally heartening to see that free trade has become a government priority . 
free trade is something that this party initiated . 
i would certainly like to see the Liberal government undertake this effort with as much vigour and tenacity as it did with its anti - free trade efforts in 1993 . 
the reality is that the Liberal track record has been about declining productivity and investment , record levels of taxation and punishing regulations and red tape . 
pie in the sky platitudes are not enough for Canadians and after six years they should and do expect more . 
at best , we have seen incomes decline . 
the Liberal government ' s lack of vision and leadership is actually destroying and undermining Canadians ' quality of life not improving it as the throne speech would have us believe . 
the government needs to cut taxes starting with personal income taxes and capital gains taxes . 
we must put money back in the pockets of those who have earned it and allow them to generate economic growth . 
the government must set firm , achievable debt reduction targets . 
the PC Party of Canada has given specifics about where it stands on tax issues such as the decrease in the capital gains tax and a full indexation of tax brackets . 
the Liberal government has remained silent . 
our party will continue to consult with experts and Canadians on this matter . 
our federal government chooses to avoid consultation . 
this reluctance to put forward a plan for tax cuts is part of a trend . 
we have not seen any ground - breaking initiatives in the last six years that would reverse the trend . 
the government ' s commitment to seasonal workers is abysmal . 
agriculture , natural resource workers , middle class families and scores of other Canadians have been ignored and undercut by the government . 
tax reduction is fundamental to the economic well being of Canadians and tax relief , more dollars being left in the hands of families with children , would be a step in that direction . 
to help children , the government must help parents of those children with meaningful tax relief . 
in the throne speech , the government said it would make a third significant investment in the national child benefit but there are no details of exactly how much the government will invest nor are there any contingency plans should the provinces and territories choose not to co - operate . 
the government even created a separate ministry aimed at poverty but with no budget and no mandate and then tried to convince Canadians that it had addressed the problem . 
Canadians will not be fooled . 
there are more examples of more promises and no action . 
the government ' s day to day management of native issues contradicts the promise that aboriginal people will be able to more fully participate and contribute to Canada ' s economy . 
this paternalistic attitude flies in the face of the government ' s pledge to promote greater aboriginal self - reliance . 
the government ' s attempt to present itself in a caring and compassionate way as a government that helps families and children in particular is a sham . 
however , in the Year of Older Persons nowhere was there even a mention of seniors . 
to quote my colleague from Saint John : 
too often in our society today , seniors are overlooked and ignored . 
our society is aging , and as it does , more and more seniors are falling through the cracks - substandard housing , inadequate health care , and in many cases , just plain neglect . 
yet this government didn ' t see fit to mention them even once in their blueprint for the new millennium . 
whether I speak of families , children or of the elderly , it is obvious that when it comes time to implement legislation that would be truly beneficial the government has constantly failed to deliver . 
one need only look at the government ' s chance to reform family law and strengthen support with the joint common senate committee on child custody in 1997 . 
the government ignored its report and the justice minister has already indicated that she wants more consultations that will last until the year 2002 . 
another area where the Liberal government has failed to deliver has been with the new Youth Criminal Justice Act . 
it has called this legislation a priority yet it has refused to acknowledge how it is going to pay for this when it is already not living up to the monetary commitments under the old young offenders act . 
the lack of attention to youth crime has spilled over into other areas of law enforcement . 
an abysmal lack of funding for the RCMP has constantly forced our Mounties to do more with less . 
this has literally endangered the officers and the public at large . 
bowing to public pressure , the government is now expecting the already overworked members of our national police force to combat high tech crimes such as money laundering , organized crime and the smuggling of people , guns and drugs . 
the government speaks of public safety as its number one priority yet it continues to release dangerous offenders into our communities . 
finally we have more Liberal rhetoric regarding the future of health care . 
it is fine for Liberals to talk about improving our health care system but it cannot be forgotten that the dire straits of health care in the country was created by this government . 
by simply putting money back in when it does not even equal the amount of money that was taken out , our health care system will not improve . 
this approach simply will not cut it . 
accessible and universal health care is one of the things for which Canadians take the most amount of pride . 
we are very anxious to see how this government plans to keep the proud tradition of our health care system alive . 
certainly this throne speech gives no hint . 
they are sadly off course . 
the Throne Speech represents a government whose vision is a mile wide and an inch deep . 
there were some fine platitudes about this country ' s potential but there was nothing that provided Canadians with an understanding of where this government is coming from , and where it is going . 
with the dawn of the new millennium , this Liberal government had a golden opportunity to present a comprehensive plan on the path that the country should take . 
sadly that opportunity was missed and the government has traded vision for vagueness at the expense of all Canadians . 
madam Speaker , on behalf of the Right Hon. Joe Clark and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada , I thank you for the opportunity to present our response to the throne speech . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
i am not sure about this , but my understanding is that there was a meeting held in Moncton , New Brunswick today and the chiefs have decided to put their traps back in the water tomorrow . 
these are not just the New Brunswick chiefs , but the Atlantic chiefs . 
what the government did with regard to the fishing situation in all of Canada from coast to coast was not addressed . 
i would like to hear from the hon. member as to what he thinks should have been in that speech . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
madam Speaker , it has become obvious that not only was there an omission in the throne speech but also there was a lax approach by the government to this emerging crisis . 
it was two weeks before the government chose to act . 
going back even further , it is shocking to think that the government did not anticipate or foresee that this was one of the possible scenarios the supreme court could follow in its decision in the Marshall case . 
i know that members of this party , members from South Shore , West Nova , Southwest Nova , Petitcodiac , Beaus é jour , our newest member , and Saint John have worked very diligently to meet with both the native and non - native fishers to get their ideas and input . 
i am encouraged to see that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has followed that tack . 
now the time has come to sit down with these members to try to come up with a solution that is going to work respecting the need for conservation and respecting what the supreme court has done in a meaningful but measured way to avoid violence or possible death in this issue . 
it has to be done quickly . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
pursuant to order adopted earlier today , the House will now proceed to the consideration of the motion concerning Canadian fisheries . 
* * * 
special DEBATE 
fisheries 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) moved : 
that this House take note of the difficulties in Canadian fisheries , especially as complicated by the Queen and Marshall case and its implications for both aboriginal and non - aboriginal peoples and for the future management of natural resources . 
i appreciate this opportunity to bring members of parliament up to date on the developments in Atlantic Canada following a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada . 
many members have been following the story in media reports over the past four weeks , but this is the first chance I have had to tell the House personally what is happening . 
i think it is important for members of parliament to understand the background to this issue and what I am going to do to resolve it . 
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall case is an important judgment that affirms certain rights of the Mi ' kmaq and Maliseet peoples flowing from the historical treaties with the crown . 
as a result of this judgment we will have to consider a number of fundamental questions about the management of the fishery . 
in this new reality our challenge is to find ways to work together to secure the future of the fishery for both aboriginal and non - aboriginal communities . 
we must formulate a process for integrating fishing under the treaty right in the overall fishery . 
we need to develop a management scheme that will respect the treaty right described by the court while being sensitive to the social and economic realities of the Atlantic fishery and those who depend on it . 
when the supreme court handed down its judgment on September 17 , the issue had my immediate and full attention . 
we have been working with federal departments to analyse the implications of the judgment . 
in addition , we engaged in immediate and continuous dialogue with aboriginal communities , provincial governments and other stakeholders in the fisheries . 
throughout this past month I have been heartened to hear the clear commitment to conservation and to co - operation expressed by the Mi ' kmaq chiefs . 
from the beginning our objective has been to achieve an effective management regime which represents a supreme court judgment and is fair to the interest in the fisheries . 
through the goodwill , patience and restraint that has been demonstrated by all participants , we have made considerable progress toward this goal . 
the treaty signed in 1760 between the British and the Mi ' kmaq was called the Peace and Friendship Treaty . 
we should keep those words in mind , peace and friendship , as we work together toward the long term solution . 
the supreme court decision is complex and its full implications are not yet totally clear . 
however , since September 17 we have clarified a number of issues raised . 
let me summarize what we understand about the judgment . 
the court has affirmed that the beneficiaries of the treaty have a right to , among other things , fish , hunt and gather and trade the products of these activities for necessaries . 
translated into modern terms the judgment indicates this right entitles the beneficiaries to have the opportunity to gain a moderate livelihood from the exercise of their fishing , hunting and gathering activities . 
there are many considerations that will be central to our efforts as we move forward in concert with all the parties . 
for example , we consider this to be a communal right and not an individual right . 
to be clear , even though the right is exercised by individuals , it is for the benefit of the collective . 
it is our view that the treaty applies to the aboriginal communities that best represent the modern manifestation of the original signatories . 
our initial assessment is that the Mi ' kmaq and the Maliseet Indian bands in Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , and the Listiguj first nation in Quebec are the modern manifestations of the collectives that benefited from the treaties . 
we now need to focus on a process that will allow us to accommodate the treaty right . 
we will involve in this process all who are directly concerned with the sustainability and the viability of the Atlantic fishery . 
i became involved earlier on this issue and I have worked closely with natives , with commercial fishers , with federal departments and with provincial premiers to find short and long term solutions . 
when the supreme court judgment was delivered on September 17 and others in government sought a clear understanding of the implications , we worked quickly to analyse some fundamental questions about the management of the fishery and how to address them . 
some court decisions take years to interpret . 
in this case we had a preliminary assessment in less than two weeks ' time . 
unfortunately , emotions ran high in some communities which resulted in serious property damage , injuries and violence . 
those events deeply saddened me and many other Canadians across the country . 
it is important for us to work together . 
in the meantime we are working on a process that will accommodate both commercial and native fisheries for years to come . 
i would like to extend my personal thanks to all the chiefs and members of the industry who took the time to meet with me to share their views and concerns . 
since the beginning I have said that I would respect the decisions of the chiefs , and that continues to be my position . 
i also want to commend the people in area 35 who together , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , found community based solutions . 
the decision that was handed down on September 17 by the supreme court left many unanswered questions . 
we need time to work together . 
but thanks to the willingness of all those who keep the lines of communication open , we have made progress . 
aboriginal members of the fishing sector , the province , the federal government have all shown a strong will to resolve this issue . 
what was really important when I met with the chiefs in Atlantic Canada was the long term issue . 
many of the chiefs felt that we must not focus on the short term and detract from what are the real issues , which is a long term issue . 
that is what I hope to focus on , that we begin a process , a comprehensive plan of progress with all those parties that are affected by the fisheries issues , to bring them together and talk about real solutions . 
real solutions can come about through dialogue and through co - operation , with people working together , sitting around the table looking at each other eye to eye and talking about the problems and how they can resolve them . 
we have been working on a short term solution . 
i know the chiefs are meeting today . 
until I hear from them directly , I will not comment whether they in fact have decided to lift the moratorium or not , because this is something that they have done on a voluntary basis . 
certainly I would be disappointed if that is the decision they have made , but I will wait until they have directly contacted me before I comment on that . 
an hon. member has said that I have not had contact . 
i will wait to see if that is the case . 
natives and non - natives have lived and worked together for generations since that time in peace and harmony . 
together with patience , restraint , respect for the law and with the co - operation of everyone , we can turn the spirit for the next century . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the House order made earlier today provides that there shall be no request for unanimous consent , so I am afraid that request cannot be granted . 
we will proceed to questions and comments . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , the government failed to obtain the court ' s objectives in the Marshall ruling . 
it had no management plan in place in the event of a decision in favour of this treaty right and it has made no attempt either in its presentation to the court or since to balance the interests of other Canadians in the face of the treaty right granted by the court . 
the minister has suggested in his speech and elsewhere that he will apply this treaty right as a communal right . 
he has said that the communal right will be exercised by individuals for the benefit of all . 
i would like to know how he will be able to determine a moderate living if he is going to apply this as a communal right . 
if we consider a moderate living for all of the Mi ' kmaq , if that is his objective , it is obvious that there will be nothing left for anybody else . 
i would like the minister , very clearly , to answer the question of how a moderate living could be determined if the treaty right is applied as a communal right . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal : 
madam Speaker , the communal right is seen as a collective right . 
i am sure the hon. member is very much aware of what that means . 
how we define a moderate livelihood , as described by the courts , is something that we have to sit around the table on . 
we have to work with the aboriginal community and with all the parties together . 
we must ask how we can ensure that the aboriginal people who are the beneficiaries of this treaty right are going to exercise it . 
we need to define those terms , but we need to define them in conjunction with the aboriginal people , by sitting around the table and talking with them . 
if we were to ask everybody in this room how to define that we would have 30 different definitions . 
it is something that has to be negotiated . 
we have to sit at the table and do it . 
i have always felt that it is better to negotiate than to go to the courts , but there are others out there who refuse to move forward . 
even when we introduced the aboriginal fishing strategy after Sparrow many said that we could not move forward . 
the last Conservative government was not any better at predicting what the supreme court was going to do with respect to Sparrow . 
however , we were trying to bring the aboriginal community into the fishery . 
buying up licences was one way we were doing it . 
we have already tried to work things out through negotiation . 
however , when we go to the courts we have to go by what they put forward and we have to live with their views . 
one of the challenges we have is to define a moderate livelihood . 
it is something we will have to sit around the table to deal with . 
that is why we need to focus on the long term and not on the short term issues that distract us . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
let the record show that there was not one mention by the minister of the people who are going to be displaced . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , I welcome the brand new Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to the portfolio . 
i was glad to hear him tell the House and all Canadians listening that it is indeed better to negotiate than it is to litigate . 
in the Bay of Fundy region , District 35 opens up its commercial offshore season tomorrow . 
the Bay of Fundy inshore fishermen are working very closely with the aboriginal people to come up with a long term solution . 
the problem is , they are doing it on their own with no help at all from DFO officials . 
will the minister commit the necessary human and financial resources to aid those people in their co - operative effort toward a long term solution ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal : 
madam Speaker , I welcome the hon. member ' s comments . 
what we want to do is start working as soon as possible on a long term solution by bringing people together . 
in the next weeks I will come forward with a plan , which will include all parties , to bring everyone around the table . 
we want to make sure that we start as soon as possible . 
certainly the input of the member will be very valuable as we move forward . 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I look forward to Reform members ' interventions in this debate . 
it is always very interesting to see where they are coming from . 
i am pleased to join my hon. colleague in debating this motion . 
the supreme court has provided valuable guidance on how an agreement between two parties , the 1760 - 61 Mi ' kmaq treaty , should be interpreted as we enter the 21 st century . 
however , the court did not specify how those treaty rights are to be implemented and respected both now and in the future . 
it is very important for people to understand that the court ' s decision is complex and far - reaching . 
there are no quick and easy solutions , as has been suggested by some people already this evening . 
a constructive resolution requires that all parties work together to respect an affirmed treaty right in a way that is sensitive to the interests of all those who rely on the fishery for their livelihood . 
we have much more work ahead of us - governments , first nations and non - first nations - to reconcile and understand the court ' s interpretation of this and other historic treaties . 
the process by which we can work together toward finding a settlement is not new . 
in fact , it is well under way . 
our commitment to negotiate with first nations in the spirit of partnership is ongoing . 
so too is our commitment to finding settlements to legitimate outstanding first nations obligations . 
these commitments were reconfirmed last year with the launch of " Gathering Strength - Canada ' s Aboriginal Action Plan '' . 
the government ' s response to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples affirmed that agreements are best negotiated in a way that respects the rights and concerns of first nations and those of their neighbours . 
this is nothing new . 
we see it taking place across the country every day . 
on the west coast the British Columbia Treaty Commission is negotiating modern day treaties with 51 first nations where no settlements were negotiated . 
in the Yukon , comprehensive claim settlements , self - government and shared resource management are returning certainty to the territory . 
in the Atlantic region a process is under way with first nations to find approaches to identify and settle legitimate outstanding obligations to first nations . 
the same spirit of partnership will be needed to understand historic treaties . 
in " Gathering Strength " we said that the continuing treaty relationship provides the context of mutual rights and responsibilities which will ensure that aboriginal and non - aboriginal people can together enjoy the benefits of this great land . 
unfortunately , for too many years first nations have not fully enjoyed the benefits of this great land , in part because they have had limited access to fish , forests , minerals and other natural resources . 
yet , court rulings have consistently and clearly demonstrated that first nations do indeed have rights . 
they have worked relentlessly to have aboriginal and treaty rights recognized . 
i would like to quote from a letter to the editor in today ' s edition of the Vancouver Sun . 
miles Richardson , the chief commissioner of the British Columbia Treaty Commission , writes : " Aboriginal rights exist whether or not they are set out in a treaty or agreed to by anyone . 
but without a treaty it is unclear about how and where those treaties apply . 
the courts have continually said that the best way to resolve these issues is through good faith negotiations with give and take on all sides '' . 
i agree completely with those words . 
i can confirm that my department is working in partnership with first nations and other governments across Canada to ensure that treaties are fully respected . 
it is clear that the supreme court ruling on the Marshall case has implications for the people of Atlantic Canada , both first nations and non - first nations . 
my colleague , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , is working very hard to arrive at a fair and equitable solution involving access to Atlantic fishery resources in light of the Marshall decision . 
the impact of the Marshall case likely will not be confined to fish and it likely will not be confined to Atlantic Canada . 
i will be reviewing with others involved how these broader issues should be addressed . 
i think we are seeing that the days are gone when one minister , the minister of Indian affairs , is the only one working on or speaking to aboriginal issues . 
these issues are of significant importance to all ministers and I commend and support my colleague , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , for his efforts . 
my role is broader . 
i see it as having the federal lead to work closely with first nation leaders , my provincial counterparts and my cabinet colleagues to explore together an overall approach to the broader question of the treaty relationship and aboriginal access to resources . 
as the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development I am just one person among many who is working on or speaking to aboriginal issues . 
these issues are of significant importance to all ministers . 
again , I commend the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for his efforts . 
together we will explore an overall approach to the broader question of the treaty relationship and aboriginal access to resources . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
there are many members who wish to ask questions tonight . 
therefore I suggest that we limit our questions and answers to one minute in order to give as many members as possible the chance to intervene . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , it is very difficult to get the opportunity to ask a question tonight and I will keep it to one minute . 
with regard to the minister ' s statement there is one looming question that needs to be asked . 
in the 1950 s and 1960 s a lobster licence in southwest Nova Scotia could be bought for $ 1 . 
i believe prior to that a licence was 25 cents . 
what kept any first nations from the lobster fishery at that time ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault : 
madam Speaker , obviously members who have a preoccupation with the fishing strategy are asking very specific questions , but they seem to have lost the gist of the speech and what I was trying to suggest . 
i want to make it very clear to members that when the courts rule on particular rights of first nations they rule with the intent of saying to Canadians and to governments , provincial and federal , that the rights exist . 
then they suggest to parliamentarians and members who are on the government side that they sit down with the aboriginal people to negotiate how those benefits from the treaty will flow , and they flow in a number of ways : from the economic development side of the issue , which was mentioned by my colleague earlier in his question to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans ; the issue of how first nations people would be involved in the regulatory regime of the fishery itself ; how they would be involved in other resources ; and in gathering , which was part of the statement that was made by the court . 
those issues were not defined . 
that was the whole issue . 
for someone to be as simplistic as to say that we should be prepared and coming out with a plan tomorrow and saying here it is , that is not what the courts asked us to do . 
the courts have asked us to sit down with the first nations and to define exactly how that treaty right will benefit them . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , we have been hearing a lot of words over there about how the government will try to work to effect a compromise between aboriginal and non - aboriginal fishermen on the east coast . 
for the benefit of those listening or watching the debate tonight , I would like them to know that this is the same minister , when push came to shove on the Musqueam reserve , who sent eviction notices to all non - aboriginal leaseholders on that reserve because the insensitive and belligerent chief of the Musqueam insisted that be done . 
could the minister tell us what comfort the fishermen on the east coast can take by his words and those of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans when this is the kind of action we have seen from the government consistently , time after time , when it has come down to an issue between aboriginal and non - aboriginal rights ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault : 
madam Speaker , any time an aboriginal community tries to create an economic development opportunity for themselves it becomes a win - lose for the Reform Party . 
i see the Musqueam issue as a win - win in the sense that first nations people will make economic benefit from this legally binding contract . 
i do not know what the Reform Party would like to see the Government of Canada do . 
if its members would give us their position on that particular file , if they would like us to subsidize the first nations to the tune of $ 7 million to deal with it , I would be prepared to look at it . 
so far all the Reform Party is doing is running at aboriginal people but not giving us solutions as to how we deal with the situation . 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I will be setting up a number of tables . 
those tables will be like any other negotiation that we have done in B.C. or across the country , as I have mentioned earlier . 
we will sit down with the people , the chiefs of the Atlantic region and other interest groups , and we will then come up with a resolution as to how best to proceed with the treaty right confirmed by the court . 
that will not happen tomorrow , next week or the week after . 
we will set up these tables and we will work through it over the winter . 
we hope that in the short term , which is in the next year , we will have some solutions to the issues . 
that is how it will be done . 
it is not the simplistic view of some members opposite that we should just go out there and ask people to break the law or change the law because we do not like the results of what the courts have ruled . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , on September 17 , 1999 , the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision in Regina versus Marshall . 
the effect of that judgment is quite clear . 
the situation in law now is that before fisheries managers can lawfully open the fishery to others , the Mi ' kmaq people must be accorded the opportunity to fully satisfy their rights for a moderate livelihood . 
in other words they are given a priority right to fish . 
this follows from the order of priority set out in Sparrow and in other cases which establish firmly that aboriginal treaty rights have priority over general , commercial and sport fishing rights . 
moderate livelihood is defined as including such basics as food , clothing and housing supplemented by a few amenities , but not the accumulation of wealth . 
it simply addresses day to day needs . 
this definition is broad and hopelessly vague . 
what happens if there is some doubt as to when to close the fishery ? 
the practice of erring on the side of aboriginal fishing rights seems to have been adopted as a method of keeping DFO managers on safe ground and free of legal challenges to their decisions . 
the present situation also allows for the courts to strike down the current regulations of the fishing rights of the Mi ' kmaq because these regulations did not have any specific accommodation in regulation as a priority right . 
the minister ' s absolute discretion under the Fisheries Act , which is the basis for the current regulations , was not held to be adequate protection of the treaty right . 
unrestrained fishing can take place by the Mi ' kmaq until such time as a valid regulatory regime can be put in place . 
that may take months or even years since consultation must take place beforehand . 
before I go any further I will look back at the situation in British Columbia because the experience there with preferential fishing rights accorded to natives is not a happy one . 
as a result the Liberal government asked John Fraser , a former Minister of Fisheries and Speaker of the House , to investigate the management system in place on the Fraser River . 
the fact of the matter was that the problem was visited on us because of the poor regulations which were in place , poor enforcement and so on of that native commercial fishery . 
prior to 1992 the fishery on the Fraser River was a profitable one . 
this past year commercial fishing was completely closed on the Fraser River for the first time in history . 
that came about as a direct result of the aboriginal fishing policy and the commercial fishing regulations which were put in place by the government . 
there is no question about that . 
over time the government has blamed nature , acts of God : the water was too high ; the water was too low ; the water was too warm ; the water was too cold ; it was El Nino ; it was La Nina , all these problems . 
when they look at that collapse they say it was El Nino in the north Pacific in the last couple of years . 
what happened ? 
why was it that there were strong returns of sockeye to Port Alberni on Vancouver Island this year ? 
why is it that in Alaska they anticipated 25 million sockeye to return to Bristol Bay and we ended up with over 40 million ? 
those fish were swimming in the same waters in the north Pacific as the fish from Fraser River . 
those returns came back strong . 
the minister talks about supreme court decisions and the effect they have on the government . 
supreme court decisions are not made in isolation . 
what did the crown do , the crown being the Liberal government ? 
in the first instance the crown expert witness described the prohibition on Mi ' kmaq trading peltry with any other than the British as a Mi ' kmaq right to trade . 
second , the expert witness conceded that the treaty right included a right to trade fish although peltry was the only commodity cited in the treaty and the price list agreed to by the chiefs and the British did not include fish . 
how do we get from an agreement which does not include fish and which is a restriction on trading rights to a priority right to fish ? 
i will tell the House how . 
the government had in place a policy on the west coast which gave to natives a priority right to fish . 
how can it have that kind of policy in place and sustained on one coast and then go to court and try to deny it on the other ? 
it cannot be done and the government knows it . 
it did not do it and that is why we are in the jam we are in now . 
there is another interesting oversight by the government . 
the crown also failed to enter into argument the public right to fish . 
the public right to fish has existed in British common law since the Magna Carta . 
the public right to fish guarantees all of us equal access to the fishery . 
that public right can only be broken by the House . 
it takes an act of parliament to allow for separate native commercial fisheries . 
that has not happened on the west coast . 
there is no act of parliament dealing with it . 
those fisheries are operating illegally . 
that treaty should not then have been interpreted as an exclusive right or as a priority right given the underlying right that we all enjoyed , the public right to fish . 
the crown failed to enter evidence demonstrating the social and economic impact on the maritime fishery if the Mi ' kmaq were awarded the right to fish commercially . 
the crown also failed to argue that a decision in favour of a commercial fishery on eels , there being no viable commercial fishery in the maritimes on eels , could result in a commercial fishery on other species such as lobster . 
the crown failed to introduce evidence such as the 1995 fisheries conservation council report which suggested that lobster were already overharvested so that any official entry into the fishery through a treaty would mean an existing participant in the public commercial fishery would have to be displaced . 
in other words , the crown failed to represent to the court the situation that currently exists , a situation in which a fishery is already oversubscribed , in which there are already too many participants according to the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council , and in which allowing the entry of others would require the displacement of those who are currently exercising rights to fish . 
that argument should have been put in place and it was not . 
the government overlooked it . 
it is not the first time a tragic oversight by the government has happened in arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
in Delgamuukw , the federal government supported aboriginal claims to self - government and the continued existence of aboriginal title . 
it caused the logging disputes we had this summer and the flagrant breaking of law , not to mention the hardship . 
the minister , himself , mentioned just moments ago that these rights would extend to logging , mining and so on . 
there is chaos and turmoil in eastern Canada . 
shortly after this decision came down , I offered the minister a reasonable and legal escape route . 
i sent it to him in a letter and I sent that letter to the provincial governments affected . 
i told him that what he should do first is to seek a stay of judgment and , second , to seek a rehearing of the case . 
it is clear what the effect of a stay of judgment would be . 
it would simply allow for a cooling off period . 
it would have allowed the government time to pool its resources and to figure out what it was going to do with the situation it was faced with . 
the second thing it would do is this . 
by asking for a rehearing it would have given the government , the attorneys general of the provinces involved and other stakeholders , whether they be fishermen ' s organizations , processing organizations or the communities affected , the opportunity to go to the supreme court and say " Look , if this decision moves ahead this is the impact it is going to have on our communities '' . 
it would have given those stakeholders a chance to say " Look , when you dealt with the Gladstone decision of the supreme court you acknowledged that others had rights '' . 
that Gladstone decision dealt with an inherent aboriginal right to commercially fish herring roe on kelp . 
even though it was found to be an inherent aboriginal right , the court acknowledged that others had acquired rights as well . 
that argument was not taken to the supreme court by the government . 
it left it out . 
it refused to bring that forward . 
it refused to defend the interests of current stakeholders . 
the fisheries oversubscribed . 
if we take away their access to the resource what is left ? 
it is not only the fishermen who will go out of business , it is the processors , the guy who runs the gas station and the guy in the grocery store . 
it trickles right down . 
it will destroy the economy . 
nothing is gained by taking from one who is simply making a living and giving it to another . 
in my view it is imperative for the court to rehear this matter . 
neither Parliament nor the provincial legislatures have the power to deal with the matter , it having been put out of reach of the legislative branch by sections 35 ( 1 ) and 52 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . 
the notwithstanding clause is not available since section 35 ( 1 ) is not a part of the charter . 
the only legislative remedy is a constitutional amendment by Parliament and the legislatures of seven provinces containing 50 % of the population of Canada . 
this is probably impractical . 
the minister says to negotiate . 
negotiations would be lovely but they can only be successful if one goes to the table with something in one ' s hand . 
the minister has no cards . 
he has no chips on the table . 
he gave it all away when he failed to score points and make the proper arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i want to quote three passages from the Gladstone decision of the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i want to show which references the government could use if it sought the court ' s advice on this matter . 
these three passages would provide legal weight to an escape route from this problem . 
the first quotation reads : 
it should also be noted that the aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s . 35 ( 1 ) exist within a legal context in which , since the time of the Magna Carta , there has been a common law right to fish in tidal waters that can only be abrogated by competent legislation . 
this is from R . v Gladstone , paragraph 67 . 
the second quotation reads : 
while the elevation of common law aboriginal rights to constitutional status obviously has an impact on the public ' s common law rights to fish in tidal waters , it was surely not intended that , by enactment of s . 35 ( 1 ) , those common law rights would be extinguished in cases where an aboriginal right to harvest fish commercially existed . 
this is R . v Gladstone , paragraph 67 . 
the last quotation reads : 
although by no means making a definitive statement on this issue , I would suggest that with regards to the distribution of the fisheries resources after conservation goals have been met , objectives such as the pursuit of economic and regional fairness , and the recognition of the historical reliance upon , and participation in , the fishery by non - aboriginal groups , are the type of objectives which can ( at least in the right circumstances ) satisfy this standard . 
in the right circumstances , such objectives are in the interest of all Canadians and , more importantly , the reconciliation of aboriginal societies with the rest of Canadian society may well depend upon their successful attainment . 
this is R . v Gladstone , paragraph 75 . 
that says it all . 
by not arguing for the rights of other Canadians when this matter was before the court , the government has put peace and good government in the country in jeopardy . 
it has walked away from the very legitimate concerns that other Canadians have for their fishery , the legitimate interests that other Canadians have to earn a living from the fishery . 
it is beyond belief that this could happen . 
DFO could balance the interests of Canadians in several ways . 
it could state , as did the court : that the federal government has the ultimate responsibility to balance the interests of all Canadians ; that there will be only one commercial fishery operating under the same rules and regulations ; that the treaty right will be accommodated by issuing commercial licences to fish in the public commercial fishery alongside other Canadians ; that any licence issued to the treaty fishery will be offset by a licence that the government purchased from a voluntary seller of a licence in the public commercial fishery . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
i must interrupt the member . 
his time is really over . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
we are on the eve of the Bay of Fundy lobster season beginning tomorrow morning . 
it is going to affect communities in my riding . 
we understand that there is now a withdrawal by some of the native fishers on the 30 day moratorium . 
there is tremendous chaos looming right now which the government could have prevented with an appropriate pre - emptive strategy that was more long term in nature . 
i would appreciate the member ' s feedback on that . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , the government ' s response to my position that a stay could be sought from the Supreme Court of Canada and that a rehearing of the judgment would be appropriate was simply to reject it as unfounded . 
i did not just pull that suggestion out of the air . 
i consulted with some prominent constitutional lawyers in my home province of British Columbia , lawyers who have experience before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
it was their suggestion and one that is very real . 
a caller mentioned to me early this morning that some of the bands that had committed to participating in the moratorium had simply moved their gear and placed it elsewhere . 
i cannot confirm this , but if the moratorium has been broken , the government should use the opportunity to say that the situation is out of hand and out of control and that it would be best to go back to the supreme court to seek some legitimate advice on how to handle the situation . 
it has 30 days to do that . 
in other words , there are only about three days left for the government to make that representation to the supreme court . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , we have a very serious situation on our hands . 
as everybody can appreciate , it is very serious for those of us who live in coastal communities and for those of us who live along the sea . 
it always disturbs me when I hear the situation presented as the hon. member who just spoke presented it , to rehear the case . 
it reminds me of people tossing a coin to see who goes first . 
they want to keep going until they get it the way they want it . 
it seems very unusual to talk about rehearing a supreme court decision . 
i wonder if the hon. member would have taken the same position if the decision had come down not in favour of the aboriginal treaties . 
we have a very serious situation . 
the court has ruled . 
it has made a decision . 
we should now be focusing our attention on giving a practical application to the decision that will be beneficial to all who are involved , to all the stakeholders in the industry . 
we have to do that through negotiation , which is where the government has fallen down . 
it waited until the decision came down before it looked at the prospect of negotiation despite the fact that Delgamuukw had talked about negotiation and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples had spoken about negotiation . 
i have heard a lot of goodwill spoken on this issue by people on all sides , by the aboriginal people and by non - aboriginal people who want to resolve this issue in a favourable way . 
this is where the minister and the government must take the lead and show leadership . 
they must not wait and see whether the negotiations have broken down . 
they must not wait and see if the traps have been pulled . 
rather , they must initiate leadership and do something now . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , the objective of asking the court to rehear the case is simply this . 
there is obviously turmoil on the east coast . 
people are upset because they are not sure what the decision means . 
they are not sure whether this priority right allows for others , non - aboriginals , to have access to the fisheries resource . 
we need clarification from the court . 
the rehearing is not to rehear the judgment . 
the court has spoken on that right . 
it has acknowledged that the treaty right exists . 
what it has not done is to clarify what right others have given this decision . 
we can argue this out until the cows come home but the quickest way to solve this problem is to go back to the court and ask it for clarification . 
what balance did the court have in mind when it allowed this treaty right ? 
was it going to allow that treaty right to be infringed ? 
the suggestion in Gladstone and in other cases is that yes , others have rights , but those rights are not stated in this case . 
in fact , the people affected by the decision were not represented in court . 
it is beyond me why the member would not want others to be heard by the court as well . 
the government did not represent the interests of existing commercial fishermen when it made that case in court . 
those people had a perfect right to be heard in that court . 
for the member from Halifax to suggest that they do not have a right to be heard in court is beyond me . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I have two quick questions for my friend . 
the first question is when we heard the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development make his intervention , he suggested that aboriginal people had been denied access to resources . 
my experience in British Columbia is that that is not the case . 
could the member elaborate on what the aboriginal participation is in the regular commercial fishery in British Columbia ? 
is this fishery a traditional fishery that existed prior to European contact and colonization ? 
was there a reliance on lobsters by the Mi ' kmaq Indians as a part of their culture and as a part of their subsistence prior to Europeans coming to North America ? 
Mr. John Cummins : 
some of the most prosperous fishermen in British Columbia were native Canadians . 
if we went to Prince Rupert in the member ' s riding of Skeena , 60 % of the people working in the fish canneries were natives . 
there was a high participation of native people in the fishery in British Columbia where the native population represents about 3 % of the population . 
with regard to native participation in the lobster fishery on the east coast , one circumstance that a historian described to me today was that fish were not mentioned in that treaty because they held very little value at the time the treaty was made . 
they were readily available to anybody who wanted them . 
if they wanted fish , it was not hard to catch them . 
as a trade item they had no value . 
certainly lobsters were probably not a commodity that was sought after by natives . 
there is no evidence to suggest that they were . 
as the member behind me said earlier , prior to 1968 anyone could have got a lobster licence . 
for a long period of time they were available to everybody for 25 cents . 
the people who participated in that fishery did so for a variety of reasons , but it was tough to make a living . 
since the restricted licences came in , the fishermen , the processors and DFO have worked hard together to put a quality product into the marketplace , a product which has gradually risen in value . 
now that it is a valuable fishery , obviously there is interest from others . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I wish to state at the outset that the aboriginal fishers and the commercial fishers on the east coast have my sympathies . 
i took the opportunity to tour . 
i went to Indian Brook , and this summer I went to Prince Edward Island to see the people on Lennox Island , the Micmacs . 
the native community , and the non - native community , shared a lot of visions on the sea . 
then there was the famous Marshall decision . 
unfortunately , I find that the government handled it very badly . 
if we look at the turn of events , what is occurring in the Atlantic provinces is not very happy . 
i decided to raise the issue of the vision of the treaties , because , as we recall , the supreme court analyzed the Murray treaty before making this decision . 
the native peoples viewed the treaties very differently from the Europeans . 
for them , the treaties were not just between governments , but between nations as well . 
what we can also see in history is that all of the people in an aboriginal nation felt bound by the treaty . 
whether it was an ordinary treaty , a friendship treaty or a treaty of co - operation , all of the members of the nation felt bound by it . 
i mentioned the example of the Micmac guardians of the treaty known as the Putu ' s . 
the guardians of these treaties , brought together the Micmac communities every year , reread the treaty and discussed it . 
we realize that the native view of the treaties is something both quite sacred and important . 
naturally , everyone knows , even if it is something rather folklorical for us , still it is a tradition that remains current . 
there were a lot of festivities when a treaty was signed : singing , dancing and so on . 
things were not the same for the Europeans . 
treaties were often signed by generals . 
this was the case with the treaty at issue , General Murray ' s treaty . 
no one knew the ins and outs of this treaty . 
they simply left it to the government or to the general signing the treaty and then forgot it . 
when the treaty became a bit of a bother , it was stuck away in the bottom of a closet and forgotten . 
this is the way the native people have always been treated . 
i would like to tell a story to explain what is going on in the Atlantic provinces . 
two hundred years ago , a neighbour of my family decided to put up a fence that took in 50 feet of my property , and things stayed that way ever after . 
each successive generation said it would straighten the matter out , reclaim our land and our jurisdiction . 
two hundred years later , the highest court in the land , the Supreme Court of Canada , decided that the fence was in the wrong place . 
how long will it take for the fence to be put back where it belongs ? 
no more than a day . 
it was no surprise that native fishers set out in their boats immediately after the decision , because they want to force the issue . 
they see that they have been left out in the cold and that it is very important that they get out quickly so as to perhaps force negotiations . 
unfortunately , negotiations are very slow in coming . 
i would not want to forget the Murray treaty , because I mentioned this famous general earlier . 
early in the 17 th century , there were a series of treaties in Virginia , Massachusetts and Pennsylvania . 
as I said earlier , the British crown drew up treaties with all aboriginal nations . 
there were treaties of this sort in Halifax in 1750 . 
grand chief Jean - Baptiste Cope , the aboriginal negotiator , concluded treaties . 
this was the dispute , according to the Marshall decision . 
nowadays , are aboriginal people allowed to trade a commercial fishery for goods or money ? 
that was for the Murray treaty . 
centuries have passed and a number of major events have occurred , including the Constitution Act of 1982 , which includes section 35 . 
that section , which was drafted after long battles by aboriginals , was included in the Constitution Act . 
so , this type of treaty was reconfirmed by the court which said " Yes , this is valid '' . 
in the current act , " aboriginal peoples of Canada " includes the Indian , Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada . 
this means that the Micmacs and Malecites meet the definition of aboriginal peoples and Indians . 
for greater certainty , in subsection ( 1 ) " treaty rights " includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired . 
this means that any land claim will now automatically be included and protected under the Constitution . 
i looked at how the jurisprudence has evolved over time , because I feel it is important . 
since this debate began , I have been hearing my colleagues commenting " We should go back to the supreme court in order to get it to specify what reasonable livelihood means ; we should go back to the supreme court and ask it to suspend its decision '' . 
since 1973 - I have gone back to 1973 but there are other earlier ones - aboriginal people have won just about all supreme court decisions . 
the first one I will refer to is Calder . 
six of the seven justices of the Supreme Court recognize the existence of ancestral title based on land occupancy Canada law . 
the justices acknowledge that aboriginal territorial rights exist not only by virtue of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 but also under Indian title as the result of ancestral occupancy . 
above and beyond the rights guaranteed by treaties or laws , aboriginal ancestral rights exist in Canada , that is to say customary rights that have survived colonization and the political transformation of the country . 
the year 1973 constituted a very significant breakthrough for aboriginal peoples before the supreme court . 
then in 1984 there was Gu é rin . 
in this case , the majority of the justices of the supreme court reaffirmed the existence of ancestral title and emphasized the federal government ' s fiduciary role . 
the Justices recognize that aboriginal ancestral rights existed before the British and Canadian regimes . 
thus , the rights existed even before the Europeans arrived here . 
the relationship between the Government of Canada and the aboriginal people is a fiduciary one and imposes real obligations on the federal authorities . 
note the wording " real obligations '' . 
then came the Simon case . 
the decision was as follows : 
the Supreme Court finds that native ancestral or treaty rights are not extinguished through the implicit effect of a statute . 
that means that the Parliament of Canada , even if it passes a law , cannot extinguish native rights . 
that is explained clearly in the decision in the Simon case , which dates back to 1985 . 
i am following a time line up to the present . 
members will realize that the solution is not necessarily a return to the supreme court . 
the Supreme Court recognizes the validity of the treaty signed by General Murray ... in favour of the Hurons - 
he had concluded an agreement with the Hurons on September 5 , 1760 . 
the Court recognizes that the consent of the native peoples is obligatory to the extinguishment of treaty rights . 
an ancestral or a treaty right may not be limited if public interest is served . 
now we come to the Sparrow case , which was pivotal to commercial and fishing activity in Canada . 
a lot of things were said in it : 
- provincial laws cannot limit an ancestral right , even if public interest is claimed . 
native fishing rights have absolute priority over others ' fishing rights . 
only the survival or the depletion of wildlife stocks may limit this right . 
i think that is currently recognized now . 
it goes on to say that , furthermore , an ancestral right cannot be interpreted so as to take in the particular regulation prior to 1982 . 
regulations that applied to one thing way back then could apply to something totally different today . 
that is the gist of the Marshall ruling . 
it says that there were trading posts at that time , and today native peoples are being given the right to engage in commercial fishing . 
this was the decision from which the case law evolved . 
it added that any government measure detrimental to the ancestral rights of native peoples must be justified explicitly and in a convincing manner . 
and the interpretation of treaties in particular must be generous and liberal . 
this means that when the supreme court judges look at a case , they are going to give the broadest possible interpretation to the words and provisions of the earlier decision . 
then there were the three famous decisions we often read about in the newspapers : 
Gladstone , Van der Peet , and Smokehouse . 
in Gladstone , the ancestral right to fish commercially was recognized . 
in Van der Peet and Smokehouse , the claimants had to show that their nation had already fished commercially in order to be granted the right to continue doing so , and failed to make their case . 
the Calder decision of 1996 recognized that the right to regulate for conservation still exists . 
the minister is therefore right in saying that regulating conservation is an important role he must play . 
finally , there was the Delgamuukw ruling , which is revolutionizing our approach to aboriginals . 
not only do we take into account the treaty , but also oral traditions . 
this means that someone appointed by his community could come before a court with oral traditions and say " I am in a position to demonstrate that we have always occupied that land '' . 
if the oral tradition is accepted by the court , it would be as powerful as the signature on a treaty . 
what I am trying to show is that the legal basis of the aboriginals is absolutely unshakable . 
whenever the minister of Indian affairs comes before the committee , once a year , I always make a point of asking him or her the following questions " When are you going to act regarding the aboriginal issue ? 
when will you stop waiting for the courts to rule on this issue ? " 
today , parliament is faced with a supreme court ruling , and it is always the same story . 
all these decisions have led to minor changes in the government ' s policy . 
there are 1,000 grey areas in the Indian Act . 
there are 1,000 grey areas in the treaties . 
and what does the government do ? 
it manages , but from one crisis to the next . 
since the crisis began on September 17 , the government ' s attitude has been " If we can manage to solve this crisis and get it over with , we will go back to our business '' . 
that has always been the problem . 
there will be other crises in natural resources . 
there will be other crises in forestry . 
there will be other crises regarding self - government , because of this government ' s total carelessness . 
it does not deal with the issue . 
the government begins discussions with various aboriginal groups and overlooks potential crises . 
instead of seeing what was up ahead , instead of saying " We will sit down and negotiate '' , the government says " We will wait for the court to decide and then we shall see '' . 
the Marshall decision recognized the rights of aboriginal fishers on the east coast and now we are stuck with having to make room for them . 
certainly , this upsets the old way of doing things . 
ingrained habits die hard . 
white fishers were not used to seeing other people allowed to enter their market , their fishery . 
someone is going to have to give in , and it is not the aboriginal people . 
frankly , we are not going to send out the RCMP to arrest them when they have a Supreme Court of Canada decision that says they are entitled to be there . 
the minister ought to settle this by negotiation . 
earlier , I received some most alarming news over the news wire . 
instead of the minister coming along with his colleague , the minister of Indian affairs , both of them proud as punch , to inform us that everything is just fine , that there are no problems , that now there is a moratorium , that the people will talk to each other , he should hop a plane this very night with his colleague , go down there to sit down and define what is a reasonable livelihood . 
that is what the Marshall decision is all about . 
in Marshall , it is stated that they are entitled to fish commercially for a reasonable livelihood . 
what does this mean ? 
as I said , the Bloc Quebecois will certainly not be in favour of going back to the supreme court to ask it to define " reasonable livelihood '' . 
is that minimum wage ? 
is it $ 100,000 a year ? 
this needs to be thoroughly discussed . 
these discussions should be held at the bargaining table . 
the definition of the suitable subsistence level must be negotiated , not determined by moratoriums that no one respects and by other interpretations that could be requested of the Supreme Court . 
i think historical errors have been made . 
for example , when the Fathers of Confederation signed the Constitution in 1867 , the native peoples were not represented . 
treaties have always been made for the benefit of the moment . 
when they were unfavourable , they were stuck in the closet . 
there is good reason why native peoples are reacting aggressively today . 
the government totally lacks courage , and shows a total lack of care . 
the Indian Act dates back 100 years , and the government is still trying to manage the aboriginal peoples with an act that is 100 years old . 
why does the government not speed up the issues of self - government and territorial claims ? 
so long as the native peoples lack the land and resources to be self - sufficient , we will go round in circles in this parliament , and the native peoples will react , especially since the supreme court decisions are in their favour . 
as I said earlier , the score is about 50 to nil in their favour . 
it seems to me there are things to be done . 
i say that Quebec ' s approach will be different . 
we want to avoid past errors . 
finally , I say to aboriginal people that Quebec will always abide by the treaties that were signed by the British crown . 
it goes without saying that we must maintain the same statutes and the same conditions . 
in fact , we will probably improve them . 
the James Bay agreement signed in May of 1975 is proof of that . 
the Quebec government has already said to the Cree " If you want to update the agreement , we are prepared to do so '' . 
i want to tell aboriginal people that the Bloc Quebecois will always support their efforts to gain greater autonomy . 
the Bloc Quebecois is probably the one party in this house that is best able to determine and appreciate what it means to strive to achieve greater autonomy . 
i want to tell aboriginal people that we are on their side in this endeavour . 
it is unfortunate that the minister is not here , and that the minister of Indian affairs is not here either . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
it is true that I am not allowed to say that . 
perhaps they are listening to me in the lobby . 
i have here with me the communique issued about an hour ago by all the chiefs on the east coast . 
i will read it in English . 
they say : 
we the chiefs wish to state that we are no longer asking our members to stop fishing . 
tomorrow morning there will be problems . 
that is why I told the minister to get on a plane this evening with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . 
they should go to the east coast . 
the chiefs have just said that the moratorium is over and that they will resume fishing tomorrow . 
their communique also states : 
this was released at 7.16 p.m. Here is proof of the government ' s negligence and carelessness , and we are paying the price . 
i suggest that they take a plane this evening and sort this out . 
the solution lies in negotiation , not in going back to the supreme court . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I thank my colleague for his comments . 
tomorrow morning , our communities will still be facing a crisis . 
tomorrow morning , children will go to school , and natives and non - natives will still be divided . 
unfortunately , the Liberal government has refused to show leadership and take action . 
it has left communities to fight it out , instead of stepping in , taking control , and sitting down and negotiating . 
it is very important to remember that what is involved here is not just a crisis in the lobster fishery . 
what my constituents are facing is a social crisis . 
we have worked very hard to get along , to work and eat together , and in less than two weeks , everything is being destroyed . 
i hope that the minister will take this into consideration and take action to ensure that we will be able to repair the damage to our communities . 
i wonder whether my Bloc Quebecois colleague would agree with me on this . 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
madam Speaker , I am totally in agreement with my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party . 
as I said at the start of my speech , I was in the aboriginal communities this summer and the summer before that . 
i noted a very fine social peace between aboriginals and non - aboriginals . 
the minister has stopped momentarily . 
i believe from the communique I have just received that it is absolutely urgent to negotiate . 
that is why I am suggesting that the minister take the plane tonight . 
if he is short domestic travel points , I would give him one , two even , if he wants to take his Indian affairs colleague to the east coast . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , would my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois not agree that because of the void in leadership in past Conservative governments and the current Liberal government the current government must allocate financial and human resources ? 
the real leadership in this crisis will come from the grassroots . 
the fishermen themselves and their communities will come up with short and long term solutions to the very serious crisis we now face in Atlantic Canada . 
would my hon. colleague not agree that the government must provide immediately the human and financial resources to help solve this problem ? 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
madam Speaker , I totally agree that , the mess having been caused by the federal government , it is once again up to the federal government to go and clean it up . 
when I refer to cleaning up the mess , my colleague from Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madelein - Pabok will surely have suggestions shortly on how that can be done . 
for instance , buying back licences , something that is often done , so that more space can be made for the aboriginal fishers who have had the supreme court rule in their favour . 
now the government is going to have to roll up its sleeves and show some courage . 
the MESS is of its doing , as my colleague has said , the Progressive Conservatives as well . 
when the Bloc Quebecois is in a sovereign Quebec , I will always be able to support my NDP colleagues , for I find their positions very close to those of our party . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , every member of the House and every Canadian who has been following recent events in the east coast lobster fishery appreciates the fragile nature of the situation that has developed in the aftermath of the recent supreme court decision affirming treaty rights for Mi ' kmaq and for aboriginal people in Canada . 
confirmation within the last hour of the collapse of the voluntary moratorium is very worrisome . 
it underscores the importance for every member of the House to try to do everything humanly possible not to inflame the tension that has gripped communities in the east coast fisheries . 
i must say in that regard I find it frankly abhorrent to hear the intemperate , inflammatory and simply historically inaccurate references again and again by Reform Party members to a racially based fishery . 
that does nothing to help move us toward a solution which will ensure a sound , sustainable fishery for all those who deserve their fair share in the aboriginal and non - aboriginal communities of the east coast . 
there seems to have been very little appreciation of the enormous significance of these legal decisions , and I might say not only by the federal government but by the Government of Nova Scotia as well . 
if there had been , both levels of government would surely have been working together and working overtime with all the stakeholders affected to develop a plan which would be ready to be put in place when the supreme court brought down its decision on the Marshall case . 
instead what we have seen is paralysis and ineffectual action , in fact virtual inaction by the federal government . 
it is a response , incidentally , that is becoming all too frequent these days as Liberal lack of leadership in the agricultural and airline industry crises so sadly demonstrates . 
as I mentioned earlier in my throne speech remarks , that same lack of foresight was not displayed by the Mi ' kmaq leadership . 
as early as April 1999 the Mi ' kmaq implored governments to recognize , and I quote directly from a document dealing with the issue of the Mi ' kmaq fishery , that the impending decision from the Supreme Court of Canada in the Queen versus Donald Marshall , Jr. case had increased Mi ' kmaq expectations for greater access to the east coast fishery while at the same time creating uncertainty and anxiety within the existing industry . 
it is regrettable in the extreme the federal government did not have the foresight to at least take under serious advisement the urgings of the Mi ' kmaq leadership to anticipate the outcome of the decision . 
the Liberal government did nothing as it awaited the Marshall decision . 
its inaction allowed tensions and chaos to take hold in the Atlantic fishing communities . 
regrettably calm heads and voices were absent in the aftermath of the Marshall decision , precisely because the current fisheries minister and his predecessor had been conspicuously absent from this file prior to the supreme court decision . 
it is little wonder that lobster dependent coastal communities in Atlantic Canada have been wracked with tension and dissension in recent weeks . 
surely the answer is not to blame the supreme court for ruling on a treaty rights issue which was placed before it . 
nor is it acceptable , as the Prime Minister suggested , to stay the court ' s decision or , as some members in the debate keep insisting , to send the matter back to the supreme court . 
it is important for us to acknowledge that aboriginal people have been waiting for two and a half centuries for a ruling to clarify their rights of access to the fishery under existing treaties . 
a lack of preparation and foresight by the government is a lame and feeble excuse on which to criticize our highest court . 
talk about shooting the messenger . 
what is the right policy response to the challenges now confronting the lobster fishery and other commercial fisheries on the east coast ? 
Atlantic Canadians want and deserve a coherent answer to this question . 
they want to see a post - Marshall regime based on principles of fairness , equity , sustainability and long term commercial viability . 
in the wake of the Marshall decision , Atlantic Canadians want a fair , just and sustainable fishing arrangement . 
to achieve this end , those involved must be consulted and listened to . 
to arrive at a workable set of rules governing access to the resource we first need to consult those who are directly involved , to listen patiently and respectfully to all the stakeholders . 
without their insights , knowledge and at least tacit agreement we cannot proceed . 
permit me however to outline briefly some broad ideas which might inform that process and might form the basis of an acceptable solution . 
first , emphasis should be put on conservation , on preserving the long term health of the stocks . 
sound principles of management and conservation based on well grounded science must be implemented . 
Atlantic Canadians cannot afford another government induced collapse along the lines of the cod fishery fiasco . 
independent expert advice must be sought and must be heeded . 
second , we need to find a way to allocate licences to aboriginal Canadians so that they may enjoy legal and uncontested access to the resource . 
this may involve the government buying back some licences from commercial fishers . 
indications are that maybe 10 % of those who are currently fishing would welcome the opportunity to make way for aboriginals to make their rightful claim to their fair share of the fishery . 
let us be clear that we are talking here about those who would choose voluntarily to exit the lobster fishery at this point in their lives . 
it is absolutely critical to build consensus on a set of rules governing conservation , allowable catches and so on . 
a level playing field is the only way that we are likely to get buy - in from all groups concerned . 
third , we must work toward establishing community based fishery policies to replace the corporate industrial model which has enriched a few large companies at the expense of many independent inshore fishermen and their families . 
the unemployment , the poverty and the out - migration in many of these fishery communities is eloquent and distressing testimony to the failure of that approach . 
over the long term , we must work to establish fishing policies that are more community oriented than industry oriented . 
it is important to recognize that the modest entry of aboriginal fishers into this resource is not the reason various Atlantic fisheries are under threat . 
in my discussions with Mi ' kmaq representatives over the last week they have expressed what is understandably a great deal of distress and , I think it is fair to say , hurt at the implication that the problems caused to the fishing stock in the east coast are in any way attributable to their entry into the fishery . 
the real threat comes from the indiscriminate and unsustainable practices of corporate fish companies and multinational conglomerates . 
in my view the Leader of the Opposition was wrong today to condemn a communal approach to resource allocation as he did in respect of the Nisga ' a treaty . 
there is every reason to believe that increased meaningful local control and responsibility for the resource by fishing communities would generate rules that guarantee a reasonable livelihood for fishers , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , while preserving the future of the resource . 
to believe otherwise is to demonstrate a striking lack of faith in the decency , fairness and sense of responsibility of fishers . 
i pay tribute to the important and ongoing work of the joint working group on the Mi ' kmaq commercial fishery that was established in February of this year . 
let us hope that same careful , respectful , collaborative approach can get important progress back on track in moving us toward a solution by involving all stakeholders : aboriginal , non - native and government . 
that working group has been earnestly laying the groundwork for a viable commercial fishery that looks after the interests of all fishers , aboriginal and non - aboriginal alike . 
this kind of forward thinking is what we need from our leaders and decision makers at every level , and especially from the federal government where it has been so notably absent . 
let me conclude by saying that we need public policies to govern our fisheries and other resources that are grounded in long term thinking , in devolving decision making to those closest to the resource , and in a sense of fairness and respect for the livelihoods of all . 
the existing industrial factory style approach underwritten by bad science and greed has taken us to where we are today . 
let us turn this page and refashion the fishery and our other resource industries as well so they will be around to provide a decent livelihood for our children for many generations to come . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I have a question for the member whose comments were quite insightful on this whole issue . 
today in the House the minister was asked several questions . 
on a couple of occasions the minister said that today we should applaud those aboriginal leaders , 33 out of 35 , who on a voluntary basis decided to have a moratorium and not fish for 30 days . 
he went on further to say that was co - operation and dialogue and that they had a solution in place which was working because dialogue and co - operation was working . 
does the hon. member now begin to believe that in order to have dialogue and co - operation it takes two trusting parties ? 
in this case where the aboriginal leaders have absolutely no trust in the minister and no trust in the government , how then can we have co - operation and dialogue and therefore how can we have some kind of co - operation with the minister and the department to solve this very serious issue ? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
madam Speaker , I do not think it gets us to a solution to be stating absolutely that this problem cannot be solved because aboriginal and non - aboriginal fishers in Atlantic Canada do not have trust in the minister . 
it is absolutely true that fishers need to be able to build trust in the minister . 
they are shaken by the fact that it was not just this minister who has been very absent and in fact stayed completely out of the arena when there was an urgent need for immediate leadership in the aftermath of the Marshall decision . 
however , I think they are badly shaken by the fact that the federal government and the Conservative government before it showed so little respect for the issue of treaty rights that they basically were forcing people into the courts , turning their backs on the important principle laid out in the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples that we need to adopt an approach that says we negotiate , not litigate , these matters . 
there is a long legacy of this government and the previous government , not just the current minister , not showing appropriate respect for aboriginal Canadians , who now , understandably , want their fair share of the Atlantic fishery . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I want to state that the leader of the NDP in her speech did not offer any constructive or workable solutions , unlike Reform , which called for a stay and a rehearing of the judgment so that they could work it out and get it right instead of getting it wrong and then the government going in with all kinds of weaknesses trying to negotiate , let alone legislate , an end to this problem . 
i was interested in her comments that slammed large companies as causing widespread poverty in the region affected . 
i wonder how she squares that with union support for her party that thrives in large successful corporate environments . 
is she totally against the corporations that fish in that area for lobsters ? 
she would rather see them all go out of business I take it . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
madam Speaker , again , I do not think it is very helpful to make sweeping statements about anything so ridiculous as condemning all large companies . 
what we are talking about are fishing methods used by some of the large companies that virtually involve raping the ocean floor , ignoring the ecosystem , ignoring the food chain and ignoring the fact that if they are going to suck up everything that is in sight and throw fish overboard because they do not meet certain specifications what they will do is cause the kind of crisis that we now see in the east coast fishery . 
i do not think it takes us anywhere to go down that blind path of ridiculous conclusions . 
we need to look carefully at what kind of fishing practices are sustainable and what ones are not . 
for the benefit of all concerned , we need to adopt a regime of practices and regulations that will ensure a sustainable fishery over time . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , the leader of the New Democratic Party says we must try to develop a viable and sustainable fishing industry . 
could she give her opinion on the most recent international agreement that Canada signed this summer ? 
i am speaking of the UN fishing agreement . 
my problem here is that Canada must now deal with a requirement from the Supreme Court of Canada to the effect that we must guarantee adequate livelihood to aboriginal people . 
however , we still do not know what is meant by a cost - effective and , more importantly , a sustainable fishery , in the language and vocabulary used by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
sustainable has to do with the proposed fishing gear , but will it be viable ? 
what is the expected level of cost - effectiveness , particularly in the context being dictated at the UN by all the countries of the world , including France , the United States , England and so on , and without subsidy ? 
what will this " without subsidy " mean ? 
what do the words " viable " and " cost - effective " currently mean ? 
right now , we are asking Gasp é Peninsula fishers to share their resources with aboriginal people . 
if the court forces them to do it , they will do it , but they will also share their misery . 
in the wintertime , they have to rely on employment insurance . 
how are we going to define the terms " viable " and " cost - effective '' ? 
is the NDP prepared to team up with us to put pressure on the Liberal government to force them to develop that definition ? 
we need it not only to solve the aboriginal crisis , but also to ensure sustainability in the fisheries of eastern Canada . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , let me say first that I think the member who has raised the question would be the first to admit that the specific questions he raises are immensely complex , both in scientific and legal terms . 
however , I agree absolutely with the point of the member ' s question , which is that the federal government has to be prepared to allocate the appropriate resources to ensure that we come up with answers to those questions . 
the situation that the member describes in his own riding is one that is recognized by all of us who represent coastal communities . 
it is a matter of recognizing that solutions have to be local , regional , national and international . 
that is why it is so important that we have international fishery agreements such as the one that is under discussion . 
it is a complicated scientific and legal issue and it is incumbent upon all of us to put pressure on the federal government to allocate the appropriate resources and to give the kind of respect that is needed to local fishers being involved in helping to devise the scheme and the regime that will govern the current and future fishery and to ensure that it is sustainable . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise in the emergency debate on the native commercial fishery on the east coast . 
i will be sharing my time with my colleague for West Nova . 
i would like to thank our fisheries critic , the member for St. John ' s West , and our House leader , the member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , for tabling this debate and bringing it to the floor of the House of Commons . 
i tried several times to make a comment when the leader of the New Democratic Party was speaking . 
i will make that comment now because I am sure the member must think that this is a catch and release fishery . 
i would like to tell this House today that it is not a catch and release fishery . 
this is very real to the people in eastern Canada . 
this debate comes as the result of the implications of a September 17 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada recognizing the treaty rights of the Mi ' kmaq , Maliseet and Passamaquoddy people . 
the Marshall decision states : 
the 1760 treaty does affirm the rights of the Mi ' kmaq people to continue to provide for their own sustenance by taking the products of their hunting , fishing , and other gathering activities , and trading for what in 1760 was termed " necessaries '' . 
this right was always subject to regulation . 
this quote from the supreme court decision indicates that the impact of this decision could be far greater than simply fishing rights . 
all crown based resources in Atlantic Canada , including logging , fishing and possibly even sub - surface rights , may be affected by this decision . 
that is why it is imperative to have direction and leadership from the government on this issue , something that has been lacking so far . 
it has been 26 days since the supreme court decision and still the federal government does not have in place any sort of long term plan for regulating a sustainable fishery . 
the lack of leadership the government has shown on this issue , and therefore the lack of confidence both native and non - native communities have in the minister and his department , will only worsen if we do not hear something concrete from the minister soon . 
as it is , there has already been violence and near chaos in the fishery in Atlantic Canada . 
because the leadership has not been there to establish a clear plan for the future of the fishery this has occurred . 
i would like to take a moment to reference the speech made yesterday by the member for Windsor - St. 
in his comments on the throne speech he spoke well and he was extremely articulate . 
in fact , he was too articulate . 
he went on , and he went on , and he went on . 
i thought for a moment that his grandmother had mistakenly vaccinated him with a gramophone needle . 
i suspect that was not the case . 
i reference it only because the government has been very quick to pat itself on the back whenever the occasion arises and it can find all kinds of accolades to congratulate itself with . 
in comparison , I point out the lack of comments , speeches and leadership , and the lack of a plan of any type coming from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans before , during or after the September 17 decision of Regina v Marshall . 
it also needs to be mentioned that former Liberal cronies in the Nova Scotia government did not even see fit to represent the province of Nova Scotia as an intervenor in the supreme court case . 
indeed , it is not leadership from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans that has put in place the 30 day moratorium . 
instead , this was the result of consultations and agreement among 33 of the 35 chiefs of the assembly of Atlantic Mi ' kmaq chiefs who agreed to voluntarily suspend their fishing to allow all parities to reach a negotiated settlement . 
not the minister but the chiefs themselves put this in place . 
unfortunately , through continued government mismanagement and incompetence this is being rescinded . 
fisheries leaders have worked with native chiefs to find a way to recognize native treaty rights . 
the result had been this 30 day moratorium that should have given the government time to implement some plans and set in place guidelines and regulations for a long term , sustainable fishery , if we would have seen leadership . 
it comes back time and time again to leadership and the confidence in this minister and in the government . 
conservation and resource management are justification for such measures . 
all of these fishers fish under conservation . 
it is now the government ' s responsibility to ensure that conservation remains the priority of the department and that regulations are in place and enforced against everyone involved in the fishery . 
resource management is based on conservation and regulations . 
regulations were introduced back in the 1930 s and continued with trap limits , size restrictions , licences , seasons and lobster fishing areas . 
this and only this has preserved the resource . 
it is due to the fishers who have followed these regulations that we have the lucrative industry we have today . 
these rules apply evenly , whether they fish in Southwest Cove , Blandford , Indian Point , Port L ' Hebert , Port Mouton , Little Harbour , Barrington , Clark ' s Harbour , Woods Harbour , Shag Harbour or Lunenburg . 
every one of those licences I mentioned earlier is more than a licence . 
it also represents a family and in some cases two or more families . 
we all know where the Reform Party will stand on this issue . 
it will argue that the native fishery is a fishery based on race . 
we must make sure that we do not fall into its trap . 
there are answers , but inciting racism is not one of them . 
the minister still has an opportunity . 
it is still within his reach - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
order , please . 
i do not think it is appropriate , especially in light of the words of the hon. member for Halifax earlier , to ascribe inciting racism to any party or any members in the House . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
the minister still has an opportunity to reach a settlement with native and non - native fishers , but to do so he must show leadership . 
leadership requires taking a position and having a plan . 
the government did not have a plan A let alone a plan B . 
believe me when I say that this is only the tip of the iceberg . 
i mentioned earlier that Chief Justice Binnie stated in the Marshall case that the 1760 treaty right was always subject to regulation . 
this is not complicated . 
this right was always subject to regulation . 
fishery representatives have stated from the beginning that the industry can accommodate the gradual integration of first nations if they fish the same seasons and have the same licensing structure and same regulations as non - natives . 
we all know that because of the supreme court ruling we now have an important new player in the fishery . 
if the government had shown any leadership at all , we would not be in the situation we are in tonight . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the priority native commercial fishery mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall decision reflects precisely the separate native commercial fishery imposed on British Columbia fishermen by the previous Conservative government . 
the regulations the minister is imposing on the east coast fishermen to manage the fallout from this decision are precisely the regulations that were imposed on the fishery in British Columbia and which have taken that fishery from profitability prior to 1992 to the point this year where there is no fishery on the Fraser . 
why should I believe the crocodile tears that are coming from the member who just spoke when the policy of his party was precisely the same as the policy mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada ? 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , is the hon. member suggesting for a moment that we do not listen to the Supreme Court of Canada , that we are somehow above the law ? 
there was an opportunity all along . 
we were following this debate and the issue very closely . 
the government failed to show leadership . 
for the hon. member to raise questions and innuendo in the House on issues which he is obviously not cognizant of and for which he does not have the facts , including the aboriginal lobster fishery that existed previously , is a serious mistake . 
if we have leadership from the government we have an opportunity to bring an end to the problem in this fishery right now . 
it insisted that we could have a stay of proceedings . 
look where the stay of proceedings is right now . 
we are 72 hours from the end of this . 
the stay of proceedings will not happen . 
we went in the wrong direction with it . 
we should have had a moratorium in the beginning . 
that is the problem . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
i have spent an awful lot of time on the phone in the last few days talking to fishermen and representatives in the hon. member ' s riding . 
a lot of them have said that possibly for the short term in terms of a solution to incorporate the aboriginal people into the fishery is a sort of voluntary buy - back program . 
there are 6,300 licences in the maritime provinces right now that incorporate lobster fishing . 
of those , roughly 10 % belong to people who would voluntarily exit the industry if they got a decent price for their licences . 
would the hon. member not agree that could be a short term solution as we work toward a long term goal ? 
the government could purchase these licences , transfer them over to the Mi ' kmaw nation and everyone could fish under the same conservation guidelines . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the problem here is that the hon. member is mixing up short term and long term solutions . 
that could perhaps be part of a long term solution . 
it is a way to integrate the native fishery into the existing fishery . 
the bottom line for the fishery has to be very simple : a commercial fishery based on rules and regulations , the same seasons , the same trap limits and the same lobster fishing areas for everyone in the fishery . 
we can find ways and we can be innovative and we can bring the Mi ' kmaw fishers into the fishery , but we have to do it under one set of rules with one set of regulations for everyone in the fishery . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the supreme court rendered its decision on the Donald Marshall Jr. case on September 17 . 
almost a month has gone by and only now has the government recognized the seriousness of this particular ruling . 
tonight ' s emergency debate is focused primarily on the fishery and more specifically on the lucrative Atlantic lobster fishery . 
yet the supreme court ruling will have far greater implications for all future federal government negotiations with our aboriginal peoples . 
as my hon. colleague from south shore has mentioned , this ruling will most definitely be used as a benchmark for future discussions over such things as logging rights , mineral rights and even land claims . 
despite the importance of this decision , the government chose to postpone the opening of parliament by three weeks to introduce a new throne speech rather than reconvene parliament to address this situation . 
shame . 
after watching the aftermath of the supreme court decision , can there be any doubt that the government was totally and utterly ill prepared to respond to the violent reaction among fishers that such a decision was bound to create ? 
it is absolutely unbelievable that the government did not have a strategy prepared for whether or not the supreme court ruled in favour of Mr. Marshall . 
that was exactly what happened . 
instead of being a leader in this dispute , the minister has left it to the affected parties to come up with their own solutions to this impasse . 
native leaders have just come up with their own solution . 
following an emergency debate this afternoon , it was reported that native leaders have now decided to withdraw their support for a 30 day moratorium . 
this means that native fishers will once again take to the waters without any government restrictions . 
such action will certainly heighten tensions in an already hostile environment . 
native leaders are charging the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans with negotiating in bad faith by imposing trap limits on two native reserves in Burnt Church and Indian Brook who refused to enter into a moratorium agreement along with the 33 other band members . 
native leaders went to great pains to explain to the media that their original decision to agree to the moratorium was taken of their own accord and was not influenced by the request of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
it would appear as though they do not recognize the authority of the minister to impose a solution to this impending crisis in the fishery . 
and why should they ? 
the minister and his own senior officials have shown clearly that they have no solution to offer either native or non - native fishers with regard to this dispute . 
in light of the decision taken by native leaders today , it is vital that this minister and this government act immediately to establish at least a short term solution until a long term solution can be negotiated . 
what was this government thinking ? 
why was it so cocky that it could not even fathom the possibility of losing this case before the supreme court ? 
on what did it base this arrogance ? 
the rulings in these cases should have triggered some kind of warning bell within the government . 
let me ask the question millions of Canadians have been asking themselves , one that our party repeated in the House today . 
why was the government not prepared to respond to this situation ? 
why ? 
i have been in the House asking questions on the illegal lobster fishery that has been going on for the past two years . 
the minister and his officials knew that was happening . 
he cannot say that he did not know . 
he should have had a plan in place . 
it is not acceptable . 
our West Nova fishers perhaps are victims of their own success . 
not so many years ago a lobster fisher was said to be involved in a poor man ' s profession . 
there were virtually no markets for lobster . 
lobsters were used as fertilizers on our fields . 
the lucrative lobster industry did not just happen overnight . 
through conservation , dedication and a lot of hard work , industry leaders slowly began developing markets for this crustacean . 
we have gone from exporting lobster to the U.S. to opening lucrative markets in Europe . 
a lobster licence that may have sold for $ 5 30 years ago is now worth $ 250,000 in some cases . 
lobster fishers risk huge amounts of money to participate in this lucrative fishery . 
besides the expense of a fishing licence , investments include the purchase of a vessel , fishing traps , bait , fuel and wages for their employees . 
there is a huge overhead involved in this industry . 
so much money is tied up in their investment that any major decrease in catches or a significant reduction in the price received for lobster would be catastrophic for many fishers , particularly those who have just recently entered into the fishery . 
let us face it . 
the government was caught with its pants down by not having a strategy in place to address the supreme court ruling . 
rather than admit its lack of preparedness and thereby ask the supreme court to grant a temporary stay of its ruling until new regulations could be established , the minister simply allowed a free for all within the Atlantic fishery which led to fear and ultimately violence . 
this could all have been avoided had the minister of fisheries taken a leadership role in establishing temporary rules and regulations that would have encouraged dialogue leading to long term solutions . 
as tensions continued to rise , the minister kept telling Atlantic Canadians that he had the authority to impose restrictions based on conservation . 
i asked the minister why , if he were legitimately concerned with conservation , he would allow anyone , native or non - native , to fish out of season . 
the supreme court has rendered its decision . 
the native people ' s right to participate in the fishery has been upheld by Canada ' s highest court . 
however , the decision did not clearly define how the fishery was to be conducted . 
many non - native fishers are frustrated by the lack of leadership coming from the minister ' s office . 
the minister ' s initial reaction to the supreme court decision was to allow native fishers to participate in an unregulated , unrestricted fishery . 
naturally , tensions were bound to escalate as commercial fishers feared the potential loss of their livelihoods . 
the Atlantic fishery is worth over $ 1 billion to our economy . 
i would consider that quite significant , yet this government has responded with a casual air of indifference toward this crisis . 
the fishers of West Nova are some of the finest fishers in the world . 
although the minister and his government colleague appear ready to turn their respective backs on the industry , I want them to know that I will not . 
i will continue to demand from the government that we work with the stakeholders to come to an acceptable solution of this serious issue . 
on behalf of our fishers I implore that the minister begins addressing the issue immediately before the lobster industry is damaged beyond repair . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for West Nova for his remarks with regard to his fishermen . 
as I mentioned to his colleague from the south shore , I have been dealing exclusively with people in fishing and representatives in that area . 
the one thing I would like to add is that he is correct that we need immediate action from the minister . 
would he not agree that with the recent decision by the aboriginal chiefs in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to lift the moratorium it would be a very wise idea for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to get on an airplane and head down to that area to deal with the issue immediately ? 
Mr. Mark Muise : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for his question . 
i guess the answer is very obvious . 
i have been saying all along that the minister should have been on the ground in Atlantic Canada three weeks ago , the day after the decision happened , so he could get a sense of what was happening . 
i walked those streets for 42 years and I have never , ever sensed the tension that is in my part of the province . 
the hon. member for South Shore and my colleagues from New Brunswick tell me the same . 
the ministers should be on the ground . 
they should be talking to be people who have a chance of resolving the problem . 
they should show leadership and they should be there immediately to start working on it right away . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I cannot help but comment on the last remarks of the hon. member . 
the tensions and whatnot that he is describing , the fears and the hurts that people are relating to him , are the same problems that we have been listening to for the last six or seven years in British Columbia . 
they are problems that were brought on by the policy of the former Conservative government . 
that has been our proposed solution . 
i am still curious as to why the suggestion I made that a stay of judgment and a rehearing of the case be sought is rejected by my friend who just spoke . 
the facts are clear that the moratorium will not work . 
it would give voice to those people who are affected by the decision . 
i would like to know why they reject that notion . 
Mr. Mark Muise : 
Mr. Speaker , I am always impressed or not impressed by my hon. colleague ' s inflammatory remarks . 
it is by working together in trying to come to a solution that we can achieve peace and some kind of acceptable solution of the matter . 
it is not by driving a wedge between both parties or using derogatory or inflammatory comments that we will come to a solution . 
we have to represent our people . 
once the court has made a decision it cannot be reheard . 
there is no room for appeal or there is no ability to appeal a supreme court decision . 
we have to work together instead of trying to drive a wedge , which my hon. colleague seems to be doing so well . 
i will have no part of that . 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) : 
they have no resource sharing revenue mechanisms to have returns of revenues to them . 
at this point in time in our history aboriginal people are saying that they want equity of access . 
we want to be self - sustaining communities and we want to participate . 
quite clearly , to put this debate in context , we must understand that aboriginal people and non - aboriginal people have to work hard to allow cooler heads to prevail , to be reasoned and logical , and to try to find constructive solutions . 
in dealing with the debate and trying to help clarify the government ' s position on the Marshall decision , I am extremely impressed with my colleague , the minister of fisheries , who very appropriately went to the aboriginal people and the commercial fishery in the Atlantic region to deal with the problem . 
it was very skilfully done . 
the level of arbitration and consultation had proven results . 
we have to work not only at dealing with an interim crisis but at a long term and strategic solution for it . 
some critics even suggest we simply put down our fist and simply close the lobster fishery indefinitely . 
closing the fishery would have been in some respects an easy way out but would have been unproductive for all parties . 
the supreme court decision , my colleagues across the way should know , is the highest legal voice in the land and we must respect its rulings . 
we cannot cherry pick on a decision that the supreme court makes when we feel that we do not like it or other people do not like it . 
what kind of a country would we have ? 
what would happen to the charter of rights under those conditions ? 
just as important , the court also said the right could be regulated . 
i am sure some people who want to inflame and create fear unnecessarily would have us believe that there would be anarchy on the seas , that native people would go out there indiscriminately after decades and years of depending on country foods and on the fishery for sustainability . 
that they would go out there and pillage is ludicrous . 
as we can see , the judgment is complex and there are still a number of issues to be resolved . 
the minister immediately sought clarification of the ruling to provide the best possible response in the shortest period of time . 
this analysis took less than two weeks when many other cases have required months . 
we have heard in the House of Commons today a reference to what the opposition considers the fact , that this is a race based right . 
it is very important to understand that the collective rights of aboriginal people are not race based . 
those comments are race based . 
the collective rights of aboriginal peoples are human rights that accrue to them by virtue of their existence as people with their own cultural , legal and political traditions . 
aboriginal peoples have welcomed others to this land and have asked only for a reasonable accommodation of their fundamental human rights as individuals and as people . 
with our particular brand of Canadian ingenuity we as Canadians have inherited and built upon a constitution that seeks accommodation between those people that were here and experienced colonization and all those that have come afterward . 
the Mi ' kmaq of the maritimes have waited 240 years to have their fundamental rights respected under a treaty entered with the crown , a treaty that is part of the constitutional fabric of the country . 
the Mi ' kmaq like other aboriginal people have been asked to respect the rule of law and they have done so by taking their claims to the courts . 
i cannot express strongly enough my belief that Canadians of all origins are by nature a generous and accommodating people who respect the rule of law . 
i have no doubt that we will continue to prove ourselves to be so in the future , but the will and the spirit to co - operate has to be there . 
we cannot achieve that level of accommodation if we create fear in the public . 
it is our responsibility to instil hope . 
it is our responsibility to be responsible in what we say to the public . 
if we inflame with those kinds of comments we are doing nothing to resolve the issue . 
it is important for the House to know the roles the minister of fisheries has played . 
instead of closing the fishery , as I mentioned earlier , the minister took the harder road of negotiations . 
the minister and the government wanted to respect the supreme court ruling . 
there were other suggestions that were not taken up for obvious reasons . 
where others might have given up the minister continues to seek solutions through dialogue and co - operation . 
the minister continues to be involved on a daily basis . 
he is in constant touch with the aboriginal leaders , the commercial fishery , government officials and Atlantic premiers . 
early on the Marshall decision was a prominent issue when the Atlantic Council of Fisheries Ministers met in Quebec City last month . 
there was a clear recognition from all jurisdictions of the need to clarify the implication of the court decision and to put in place a management regime . 
the council recommended that regime must ensure the conservation objectives are not compromised and be fair to other interests in the fisheries . 
we can do that and that is about economic preservation . 
major investments have been made by the commercial fishermen out there . 
it is a major investment . 
that is another thing to think about . 
however it is quite interesting if put it into the proper context . 
on district 23 in the Burnt Church area of Miramichi Bay the number of lobster trapped used by aboriginal people adds up to less than 1 % of the number of traps used by the non - commercial fishery . 
is that a conservation crime ? 
is that something that at this point we will have to be totally unreasonable about ? 
it is something we should think about . 
we have to put everything in context . 
i agree that we should be looking at finding a solution . 
we all witnessed the unfortunate incidents in the days following the court . 
in conclusion , we have to work hard . 
as I said in the beginning , closing the fishery would have been the easy solution , the quick fix . 
but there is no quick fix on an issue that affects people ' s rights , lives and livelihoods . 
i am confident that the minister ' s staff and department will continue working in the right direction to better the lives of everyone involved . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the hon. member for her remarks . 
they were very insightful , passionate and sincere . 
i could not agree more with the need for reasoned and moderate debate . 
however , along that line I would ask the hon. member , in all sincerity , that if this was the true intention , why did her government , three days after the Marshall decision was handed down , decide to prorogue parliament , thus hamstringing and in no small way completely doing away with the ability to debate this issue in the House of Commons ? 
it was the Progressive Conservative Party that had to call for this debate . 
it was not done voluntarily by the government . 
if that is the case and if debate is what will lead to a solution - and I agree with the member that it will - why did her government do away with that ability by proroguing this House ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the issue on proroguing the House is a red herring . 
it is irrelevant to the very important issue at hand . 
we had a lot of things to consider . 
there were a number of requirements that had to be met . 
we were preparing for a throne speech and the installation of a new governor general . 
those are not excuses ; those are reasons . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like my hon. colleague opposite to repeat part of her speech . 
i want to be absolutely sure that I understood the interpreter . 
one percent is nothing . 
that is the problem . 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew : 
Mr. Speaker , I would never consider contradicting the minister . 
the minister indicated that conservation is important , and it is an important issue , not just for the fisheries but for every resource . 
that is an important issue and it is a general statement . 
we can assume whatever we want , but what I went on to say was that there are other considerations besides conservation . 
conservation is always important when we are dealing with a resource , but there is also economic preservation . 
that was the point I was making . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have great respect for the hon. member and the area from which she comes . 
if the member believes that this minister is doing such a fine job , then would she not try to convince her minister , because the people ' s perception of politics is their reality , and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to get out of Ottawa , to get down to the maritime region and to deal with this issue firsthand , instead of dealing with it by long distance from Ottawa ? 
would the member not make that suggestion to her minister and make it an imperative motion for him to get down there immediately to deal with this issue ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew : 
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague knows that this is important to the minister . 
i also know that the minister has a great deal of respect for members of the House and would want to be here to respond to their questions as he did today in question period . 
he would want to be here to respond to those members who represent the people in the area , and he has been dealing with those people continuously . 
that is not an issue . 
the minister has demonstrated quite clearly that he is capable , committed and has the confidence to do the job . 
Mr. Charles Hubbard ( Miramichi , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Miramichi , as the hon. member opposite noted , is where Burnt Church is , where Red Bank is and where Eel Ground is , three of the reserves that I represent in the House . 
listening to some of the debate tonight I wonder how well some of our native people are being represented in the House . 
across this country there are nearly one million status and non - status people who were the original people of this country . 
i take affront with some of the statements made in the House in terms of the rights those native people have and should have under the agreements our ancestors made with them . 
i also have a very valuable industry in my constituency , which is fishing . 
tonight we are talking about lobsters , but in terms of the fishery it is a much broader issue than just lobsters . 
lobsters over the last 40 to 50 years have become one of our most valuable species , along with our snow crabs . 
those two species provide a lot of income to the people along the Baie de Chaleurs and Miramichi Bay areas . 
we also have to recognize what happened and be very aware of the situation that developed which pitted one group of people against another group , the commercial fishermen . 
i would like to point out to the House that some commercial fishermen are natives . 
the aboriginal fishery strategy over the past decade has offered fishing licences and in fact the Burnt Church reserve has approximately 10 licences . 
it is the same with the reserve at Big Cove where they have fishing licences and also with Indian Island . 
it was a very unfortunate incident that happened on that Sunday some weeks ago when fishermen decided to take the law into their own hands . 
there was a certain degree of frustration because they saw , in terms of the supreme court ruling , that their industry and their livelihood was at stake . 
i met with some of those fishermen . 
they came to my office in great numbers on the Wednesday prior to the incident that happened on Sunday . 
it seems that there were other people who came into our area . 
there were lobster boats and commercial boats that came from outside the Miramichi constituency to fish on the shores of Burnt Church . 
we have to recognize the value of conservation . 
the inner Miramichi Bay in the fall of the year has very warm water . 
the lobsters come to change their shells , to moult . 
it is a nursery where the lobsters procreate and develop for the next season ahead . 
with that , the commercial fishermen saw a danger to their industry . 
we also have to recognize that for the native people of Atlantic Canada the treaty rights they obtained as a result of the Marshall decision created a great period of exhilaration , a great victory they had won , a point they had been striving for and reaching for over many years . 
many of the native people took to the shores to set their pots and fishing traps to see what lobsters they could obtain . 
we talk of this in terms of wisdom . 
many of us are pointing at certain people who have made mistakes . 
i would like to point out , Mr. Speaker , that when I point at you with one finger , I am actually pointing back at myself with my other three . 
i think a lot of us in the House tonight , as we try to find some villain in this , are actually doing three times as much damage to ourselves as we are to the people we are pointing toward . 
some will criticize the supreme court . 
they feel that the supreme court did not have enough wisdom in terms of the outcome of the decision it rendered . 
the court might have stated in its own behalf that it recognized rural Canada and especially the Atlantic provinces if it had foreseen the difficulties , but that wisdom was not seen by the supreme court . 
some will criticize the minister , but the minister has to look at those judgments . 
he and his staff and the Department of Justice have to decide just what is said in those pages that have been written by the justices . 
it takes some time for that to be brought to light and for the proper decisions to be made . 
some will criticize the fishermen who were taken back by the decision . 
they were very much concerned that an immediate process should evolve and that the minister should simply say " no native fishermen '' . 
that would not be a wise decision . 
the native people have as much right to the resources of the country as anyone else . 
in terms of perspective , we must mention that the fishery has grown over the years . 
in the 1960 s a commercial lobster licence could be obtained for about 25 cents . 
today licences are worth somewhere between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 . 
we also have to recognize that over the years the lobster industry has been developed . 
i read an article some years ago about teachers being sought in the southern part of New Brunswick . 
at that time , during the great depression , teachers often boarded with parents in the community . 
one promise that one school board made in southern New Brunswick was that no one boarding at their house would have to eat lobsters more than twice a week . 
lobsters were frowned upon in terms of being a commodity and only poor people ate lobsters . 
today , of course , such is not the case . 
we have to recognize that in Atlantic Canada the fishery has been developed . 
the various species all have different values . 
we talk about smelts , clams , oysters and the list goes on . 
in fact , the Marshall case dealt with eels . 
the fact is that all of them will have to eventually be translated into accommodations in terms of how native and non - native fishermen will approach the fishery . 
the point is that not only have native people been restricted in terms of the fishery ; the people on the west coast talk about the public right to fish . 
on the Atlantic side we do not have the public right to fish . 
fishing has been closely regulated and people have obtained fishing licences as a result of having paid fees over the years which have been applied by certain regulations . 
i hope that in some way this matter can be resolved . 
in the Miramichi constituency we have people with fear . 
people are afraid that others may infringe on their rights . 
we have had burnings , we have had trucks destroyed . 
there was a special healing site that the native people in Burnt Church burned by fire . 
a house has been destroyed . 
all of those things have created great problems in our community . 
with it , people who have lived side by side for some 200 years are suddenly no longer great friends . 
i hope that in the debate tonight we can bring some reason to this problem that has been created in the Atlantic fishery , that people can restore some faith in their ability to relate and understand other people and that , above all , in the near future we can develop a fishery which can accommodate people , both native and non - native , and that the fishery can work in the best interests of the economy of Atlantic Canada . 
i also wish to point out one final point . 
burnt Church is a very isolated reserve . 
it consists of between 900 and 1,100 people , depending upon the season . 
the people of Burnt Church have great economic needs . 
i think that is true of a great number of reserves across the country . 
there are some 600 of them . 
many of them lack the economic resources to develop their own people and to provide a livelihood for their children . 
let us put all of that into perspective and hope that we as Canadians and as parliamentarians can join together to see a resolution to this great problem that will accommodate most of our people . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it was suggested that returning to court for a stay of judgment and a rehearing was cherry picking . 
it is not the case . 
the purpose of returning to court would be to avoid the type of confrontation we have seen and to seek a clarification of the court ' s intent in this decision . 
for example , would they permit an infringement of the treaty right that they recommended ? 
i refer to paragraph 75 of the Gladstone decision where the court itself recognized that others had acquired rights to fish . 
it said that reconciliation of aboriginal societies with the rest of Canadian society may well depend on achieving that balance . 
does the member opposite not see a value in returning to the court and getting the court ' s opinion on how these conflicting rights could be adequately addressed ? 
Mr. Charles Hubbard : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not a lawyer and I certainly have to take under advisement what the hon. member has asked . 
the conclusion I come to is that since the early 1980 s we have brought the Constitution home and the supreme court is the supreme court . 
certainly the Department of Justice may work out with members of the court an interpretation of some of their statements in terms of that judgment , but we cannot turn our backs on a supreme court decision . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask a question of my colleague from the riding of Miramichi , which is adjacent to the riding of Acadie - Bathurst . 
i sympathize with the problems in his riding , but they are the same as in my riding . 
my colleague told us that fishers went to see him in his office on Wednesday , and all the problems occurred on Sunday . 
then we learned that the minister went there two weeks later . 
i would like my colleague to comment on this situation . 
is he disappointed with his minister ' s attitude or does he approve of the minister ' s slowness in handling this whole issue ? 
there is a crisis in our region , and we must take action . 
i think the minister should not even be here tonight . 
he should be in Atlantic Canada trying to solve the problems of native and non - native fishers . 
Mr. Charles Hubbard : 
Mr. Speaker , in New Jersey on Thursday of last week I met with a number of people and I visited the Burnt Church reserve a short time later . 
i made a statement that generally all people are good people but there are people in every group who want to create major problems . 
i know that in terms of what happened there , we were unfortunate to have outsiders come to Burnt Church . 
it was also unfortunate that some of the fishermen did what they did . 
on the afternoon in question , members of the MFU and I spoke with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i called him on the phone and he was readily available . 
that the boats came from outside the constituency on the weekend certainly was a major factor . 
from that , the Sunday morning episode resulted and then the Sunday night episode shortly after I visited . 
i was down there that evening from about 6.30 to 7 p.m. and shortly toward dark those vehicles were destroyed . 
it is a very unfortunate thing , but the point is that it happened and we all have to live with it . 
hopefully the minister in the fine efforts he made in the week since has brought some resolution to it . 
he has met with the 30 chiefs . 
he certainly had great courage in doing so and I want to commend him for it . 
he met with the MFU and hopefully we can resolve this . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , native communities , like many non - native communities , are in some economic difficulties . 
the hon. member for Miramichi mentioned that . 
there are a lot of native communities in difficulties . 
that is why it is so important now that there is an opportunity for them to have some work in the fishing industry we make sure that 10 years from now there are still lobster out there . 
that is going to benefit both communities . 
would the hon. member agree that we could have seen more leadership on the part of his government , because conservation is the solution to this ? 
we have to get around the table . 
it is very clear that conservation is what - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. member for Miramichi has 30 seconds , please . 
Mr. Charles Hubbard : 
Mr. Speaker , the leadership was very evident . 
i was satisfied with the leadership the minister provided . 
i am glad to see the hon. member opposite , who has a very large native community of her own , speaking up for them and representing them in the House . 
i thank her for that . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to engage in the debate this evening . 
i would like to start by focusing my remarks on the supreme court . 
i do not doubt for one moment its sincerity . 
i do not doubt for one moment its character or the integrity of the nine justices who sit on the supreme court , as I do not doubt the integrity and the character of members opposite and of members in other political parties who hold different views than I do on this issue . 
i would hope that members opposite would refrain from attacking the character and motives of people in this party every time the Reform Party disagrees with them on a philosophical basis on issues that are so fundamentally important to the future of Canada . 
in saying that , I want to focus on the supreme court . 
many people and many members in the House look at the Supreme Court of Canada in awe . 
they somehow see these nine justices as being virtually infallible and that somehow we have to accept anything handed down from the supreme court as being the final word . 
it is as if these people were anointed or appointed by some higher being , by some deity that is unknown to us . 
the fact is that the nine justices on the supreme court were all appointed by partisan prime ministers , either Conservative or Liberal . 
over the past 30 or 40 years all the existing justices on the supreme court have received their elevation to the bench in that manner . 
while I would never want to accuse any of the justices on the supreme court of being partisan , it is important to note that I recognize that they are appointed within a certain milieu , a certain political prevailing philosophy . 
for about three decades or more that certain political prevailing philosophy can be characterized in several different ways . 
we could call it more and more the posture of the politically correct . 
we could call it progressive enlightened thinking . 
or , let me borrow from Thomas Sowell , the great American writer who said in his excellent book The Vision of the Anointed that these people have become enraptured with a certain vision that is predominantly a Liberal left vision . 
the philosophy of that is so evident in our political , social and academic institutions . 
it has become progressively more so over the last three or four decades . 
we are not saying that these are bad people . 
we are not saying that their characters are flawed . 
we are not saying that they ought to be harshly rebuked and criticized for the views they hold . 
what we do say is that they are fundamentally wrong in their thinking . 
that is the problem we have with this issue today . 
the people who embrace this vision of the anointed , again to borrow from Thomas Sowell , assume their own moral superiority because they are convinced of the rightness of their cause . 
therefore , they believe they are somehow morally on a higher plane than anybody else . 
they believe that anybody who disagrees is not only morally wrong , but is in sin . 
we can see the evidence of that in the debate in this chamber from time to time . 
also , these people who are ensconced in this vision of the anointed also tend to insulate themselves from the reality of the impacts of their own decisions . 
they do not want to see the reality of the decisions they make . 
when they make a decision and feedback comes back to them that somehow something has really gone wrong , they point their fingers at anyone and everyone and any other thing they can possibly dream up rather than seriously examine from an intellectually honest point of view their own positions and decisions to see how they affected the outcomes that they do not really want to see . 
i submit that the Supreme Court of Canada is very much caught up in this vision of the anointed . 
the political institutions of this country , the Liberal Party in particular , are also very much caught up in this vision of the anointed . 
what we have is a people who fervently believe that they can right the wrongs of history by ignoring the lessons of history . 
they do not want to give any regard to history ' s lessons . 
they do not want to give regard to basic democratic principles and values . 
they think they can ignore basic democratic principles and values and that because they are somehow more clever , gifted or more able , they can concoct some kind of new societal arrangement that will be successful while ignoring those principles . 
i submit that 10,000 years of human history has proven that cannot be achieved . 
without democracy we return to the barbarism that all our ancestors experienced in the past . 
regardless of who we are in this House , that is where we came from . 
we learned that through 10,000 years of recorded human history . 
we learned from experience . 
we learned by trial and error and many different kinds of societal arrangements that the best way to arrange our affairs so that we can have peace , harmony , prosperity and human rights is through basic democratic institutions . 
the cornerstone or founding principle of democracy is the equality of all people before the law . 
we cannot have it any other way . 
we cannot be so smart , egotistical or arrogant as to believe we can somehow rearrange society and give special status and rights to be assigned on whatever basis , blindly ignoring the lessons of history and basic democratic principles and expect that we will have peace and harmony in society . 
i submit that the evidence of that is before us today . 
we have had three or four decades of successive policies emanating from government that have tried to encourage Canadians , aboriginal Canadians in particular , that this somehow can happen and that it somehow can work . 
not just in the case of the east coast lobster fishery but right across the country we are seeing more and more evidence that not only does it not work but it is leading to real conflict and disharmony in our society . 
it is not healthy . 
i do not doubt the sincerity of the justices on the supreme court and that they were trying to do the right thing . 
i question how they could come up with the decision they did when the treaty of 1760 on which they relied to render this decision does not even mention fish . 
clearly what they were trying to do was right the wrongs of history by reading into this treaty things that were not there and trying to create some kind of different societal structure that would in their view be a benefit to the Mi ' kmaq people . 
as much as there are people in the east coast lobster fishery right now who are being displaced and are hurting financially and will continue to hurt financially until this issue is resolved , the people who will pay the biggest price for this folly before it is all said and done will be the Mi ' kmaq people themselves . 
i will say it again for anybody in the House who cares to listen . 
the people who will pay the biggest price before it is all said and done will be the Mi ' kmaq people themselves . 
unless the government can demonstrate leadership on this and can break with its failed vision of the past and embrace the genuine basic principles of democracy and encourage our aboriginal brothers and sisters to do the same , we will be in real trouble . 
we can see it coming everywhere . 
i take absolutely no pleasure in saying this but it is coming . 
it can be seen everywhere : the Musqueam in Vancouver , the east coast lobster fishery , in Manitoba and in Northern B.C. 
talk about encouraging aboriginal people in the wrong direction . 
i would wager that the sons and daughters of members in this place are not trying to forge a future for themselves in a fishery somewhere . 
the resource industries in Canada are mature to say the least and some of them are over mature as my colleague from Delta pointed out . 
some of these are declining industries . 
the people who are in the fishery right now are there because they have a historical attachment to it . 
they have a history with it and are earning a living right now . 
what we are telling all other Canadians is that they should get into the information age and the technological age and think about the future in terms of global trade and global economies . 
we then turn to the aboriginal people and tell them to think of the future in terms of the fishery and logging , in terms of resource extraction and those industries that are already mature in Canada . 
it is only within democratic institutions that the value and worth of the ordinary individual is found . 
when we get into assigning rights and status on the basis of anything other than individual equality , we end up going backward in time . 
we end up building walls rather than bridges and we end up creating real conflict in society over time . 
the supreme court and the democratic institutions of the country genuinely believe they can achieve what human beings have never been able to achieve in the past 10,000 years . 
the evidence that they cannot is before us today . 
the Marshall decision from the supreme court should be a real wake - up call for everyone who is considering what the Nisga ' a agreement means . 
the treaty I am talking about in this instance is a very thin document . 
the Nisga ' a treaty is 200 pages long with 400 pages of appendices and 50 or so agreements that have yet to be negotiated and do not even fall within the agreement as it exists today . 
each one of those conditions is subject to a supreme court decision at some point in the future . 
consider what that might mean for our country . 
the people who have negotiated these treaties have no idea . 
when we suggested in the spring that they submit that treaty to the supreme court for a reference so we could find out what the supreme court ' s view would be on the application of the charter of rights and freedoms and what the supreme court ' s view would be with respect to the constitutionality of that agreement , those people were so arrogant and so sure of themselves , again assuming their own moral superiority , that they looked at us , tried to mischaracterize what we were saying and ignored the warnings we were trying to give them . 
we have been trying to give these warnings for six years in this place . 
we have been trying for six years to say , " hold on , we think you ' d better think this through again . 
i would argue that the empirical evidence supports us . 
the empirical evidence supports exactly what the Reform Party of Canada has been saying since its inception . 
when we break away from the equality of all Canadians , when we start assigning special status or special rights or special access to resources , when we start assigning different rights to people on any basis , we have a recipe for disaster . 
we have a recipe for disaster on the east coast of Canada right now . 
i do not know what the answer is but I do know how we got here . 
i know the government needs to take leadership . 
it needs to demonstrate that it has the ability to lead and to govern for peace , order and good government which it fails to do . 
it routinely allows decisions to be made by the supreme court so it can duck the responsibility and the potential follow up for making those decisions itself . 
that is why we are in the predicament we are in today . 
i submit that there are people in the federal government and the justice department who are constitutional and legal experts . 
there has to be ways of dealing with this issue that will be fair , affordable and lead to a resolve of the issue . 
the very first responsibility of this government or any federal government has to be to reach out to those aboriginal people who are caught betwixt and between and tell them that their existence with special status has never been of any benefit to them at all . 
we need to rethink the relationship between the aboriginal people and the Government of Canada and the rest of Canada . 
obviously the existing relationship has not worked to the benefit of aboriginal people and has not worked to the benefit of Canada . 
it is time that we broke from the failed thinking and failed policies of the past and came up with some new ideas , some new visions and some new ways to move forward . 
if we do not do that , I fear that we are in for more conflict , more unrest and more of these kinds of events that have been occurring on the east coast of Canada . 
i do believe that there is a potential for that if this government does not demonstrate that it has the ability to lead and the ability to change its thinking on these fundamental issues . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can see that many members want to put questions , so I would like to give the hon. member for Skeena the opportunity to speak while the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Indian Affairs are here , by asking him the following question . 
since the House of Commons has recognized the need to hold , on this very first day of the session , after the government has prorogued Parliament , an emergency debate on the fishery crisis and the Marshall judgment , would it not have been important for the government to immediately re - establish both the standing committees on aboriginal affairs and fisheries , so that we could find out who would be representing the government on these committees ? 
some members have told us tonight " We are not lawyers nor constitutional law experts '' . 
this committee would have had the opportunity and the money to examine the ins and outs of this issue and help us make a more informed decision on what is happening here . 
i have the feeling that the government , just like the minister who would like us to believe that he is doing something , would have us go round in circles . 
i would remind the House that we do not even have the right to vote on the issue being debated here tonight . 
in the end , I feel like I may be losing my time here , when there are things to be negotiated . 
in the meantime , to be able to inform the people we represent , we should have access to correct and relevant information . 
i would like to know if my hon. colleague from Skeena is as eager as I am to find out the truth and to see if the government is indeed out of money . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly appreciate my friend ' s question . 
we have sat on the fisheries committee together in the past and I have appreciated his contribution . 
i think the member would agree with me , since we have both sat on committees for a number of years now , in some cases together and in some cases apart , that the Liberal government is not fundamentally interested in having committees decide anything . 
it does not really want the committees to get into these issues and examine them because the committee might make some recommendations that it would not want to have to deal with . 
i am sure the hon. member would tend to agree with me that the government really does not know how to deal with the issue in front of it right now . 
it is almost like somebody rolled a grenade into the room . 
the government does not know how to deal with it but it certainly does not want to allow any other body other than itself to come up with the final decision on it . 
part of the problem with our parliamentary system is that it is just not functioning the way it is supposed to . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the comments of the member for Skeena and the fact that he believes there are enough constitutional lawyers , enough legal opinions and enough bureaucrats in Ottawa to help find some sort of solution to this problem . 
would the member not agree with me that the real solution to this issue probably lies in the fishermen themselves and in the coastal communities of Atlantic Canada ? 
in the last 26 days that this decision has been rendered , we have heard time and time again that the aboriginal people and non - aboriginal people have been getting together to come up with short term and then long term solutions for the long term viability and conservation minded aspects of the fishery . 
the problem of course is that the government is not giving any human or financial resources to aid those people in their consultations . 
would the member not agree that a better solution to this would be from the ground up instead of the top down ? 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , I would have to agree with my friend that in most cases bottom up solutions are better . 
being a member of a populace party , we certainly believe in populism and in grassroots democracy . 
i would like to think that there is hope for a resolution along those lines and maybe there will be . 
i am not saying there will not . 
far be it for me to throw cold water on that idea . 
obviously something has to be done . 
what we have right now are two fundamentally competing interests . 
human nature being what it is , it is going to be very difficult to reconcile those competing interests . 
whether it can be done from the bottom up or not remains to be seen . 
hopefully there is some goodwill on both sides . 
hopefully there is an attempt being made as we speak to reconcile and to move forward in some spirit of cooperation . 
i am not saying it cannot happen . 
i am just saying that I am not holding my breath . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our national anthem states that this is our home and native land . 
all of a sudden one segment of society feels like it has a second class citizenship , that their citizenship is not a full citizenship anymore and we have bad relations all of a sudden . 
my hon. colleague has commented on the bad situation that is occurring . 
before I ask him to comment further on that , I would like to say that our national anthem also says that we stand on guard for thee . 
i would like to know who is standing guard for the nation ? 
every group has its defenders . 
every group has people who speak for it . 
i would like to know who is going to speak for the nation in this debate . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
there is no demonstrated leadership from the federal government right now and that is a big part of the problem . 
in speaking to the first comment made by my hon. colleague , I would have to go back to the comments I made in my intervention . 
when we break from basic democratic principles and values , when we wander away from the principle of the equality of all citizens before the law , regardless of how good our intentions are , regardless of how noble our motives are , we are creating the environment that leads to the kind of conflict and confrontation that we see today . 
human nature is universal . 
human nature has been with us as long as there have been human beings . 
it is universal and it does not change . 
we have learned over a period of 10,000 years that with basic democratic institutions we can arrange society in a way that we can move forward in peace and harmony . 
when we start to undermine those basic core principles and values we get the kind of results that we see today on the east coast of Canada . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Nisga ' a treaty gives 25 % of the salmon returning to the Nass River to the Nisga ' a . 
four other bands are competing for access to that resource whose treaty claims have not been negotiated . 
the Nisga ' a treaty is a modern version of the 1760 treaty in Marshall that the supreme court ruled on . 
it is a much expanded version , by the way , in that it gives natives a priority right to fish . 
seeing that there is so much consternation in the House today I would like to ask the member to his knowledge what position have other parties taken with regard to the Nisga ' a treaty , given its close proximity in relationship to the treaty we are discussing . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , to the very best of my knowledge every party in the House save the Reform Party of Canada is supportive of the Nisga ' a treaty . 
every party has indicated that they will be voting in favour of the treaty . 
every party has expressed a desire to have the treaty passed with speed . 
frankly that is a good question by the member from Delta because with the problems that we see coming out of the supreme court in the Marshall case , based on this ancient treaty which as I said is very thin , we can just imagine the kinds of problems that could arise from the Nisga ' a treaty . 
it really bears sober second thought . 
it really bears a good debate and it really bears careful consideration of the kinds of problems we might be opening ourselves to down the road , given the instance of the Marshall decision and how it has impacted on the east coast fishery . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Malpeque . 
this has been an interesting debate , a fruitful debate . 
sometimes I wondered what the debate was about . 
we had a lot of discussion about the Supreme Court of Canada and about judicial law making . 
that is a valuable subject but it might deserve an arena in its own right . 
it does touch on the issue of the fisheries and the issue of aboriginal rights , and I will treat it only in that context and where it does have a relevance . 
the important thing to remember here is the maxim of the wisest of common law legal philosophers , Jeremy Bentham . 
he was saying that law was not made by any single person or institution . 
i will have something to say on that in a moment . 
what I am about to suggest is a larger role for the judiciary and for other constitutional players . 
one of the most thoughtful of our members of the press gallery , Jeffrey Simpson , wrote several weeks ago in an article that reminded me of something I wrote many years ago on the discussion of Brown v Board of Education which has been much criticized in the House and elsewhere but by people who never the read the judgment . 
this so often happens . 
brown v Board of Education is really two cases . 
one is the actual judgment on school segregation . 
it is a phrase taken from equity . 
it was used by Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter , the greatest of the Roosevelt appointments to the supreme court . 
it directed attention to the basic point that complex social problems require complex solutions which need complex evidence . 
this is where the United States supreme court has perfected a role that may be helpful to us to study . 
the solution of fisheries problems on the east coast , the solution of logging problems on the west bank of Okanagan Lake , and the solution of other problems of aboriginal rights should be done best against a background of social economic evidence . 
we have in this country , because I see them consulted internationally , experts in economic resources and economic resource management . 
this is the sort of case for wise decision that requires taking that type of evidence into account . 
the big thrust of the second decision in Brown v the Board of Education was that there was a role for a third party in monitoring the solution . 
the emphasis of the phrase " with all deliberate speed " was that it would not be a solution achieved in one day , or in a single ruling , but might require a number of years of supervision , monitoring , consulting with and directing the parties . 
this is where a role , whether it is executive , legislative , judicial , or a combination of both , is an essential part of the problem solving . 
in the American context it was clearly an ample judicial role . 
this in the Canadian context has to be borne in mind in connection with the nature of our supreme court . 
i am very much surprised and a little disturbed because I think it follows from lack of study of supreme court decisions a suggestion of class bias in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i would not have found that at all . 
i would have suggested a highly technical approach that sometimes would benefit by more opening to sociological facts , economic facts which are the root of decision making . 
in this case I would call for a Brandeis brief . 
the whole nature of jurisprudence before the constitutional court is the adducing of evidence , social and economic evidence . 
in the case of fisheries it would be the nature of the resource , how much is there , what proposals cans be made for its utilization and for its sharing . 
here I take us back to one of the nicer phrases of our supreme court , one of the wiser counsels , the obligations to negotiate and to negotiate in good faith . 
it is a very positive factor in my approach to the Nisga ' a treaty which I believe the chief and council of the Nisga ' a band negotiated in good faith . 
i would be less supportive of other initiatives in this area if I did not have the same feeling of satisfaction that negotiation in good faith involves a concept of recognition of good neighbourliness . 
these are phrases that the World Court has used but they apply equally in the common law from which the Polish judge who cited them borrowed those phrases directly . 
there are important gaps in our law as to aboriginal rights and treaty rights . 
one of these very obviously is the meaning of aboriginal rights and treaty rights . 
they are in sections 25 and 35 of the charter , but they were put there as what is called saving clauses . 
they are put in there because they were not there in the original charter of rights . 
there are further gaps in the law in so far as section 35 ( 1 ) saves existing rights , but section 35 ( 3 ) which was adopted 12 months later recognizes and constitutionalizes future treaties . 
i have expressed in the House some questions on this point . 
could a future treaty which ran counter to the charter or the constitution proper be constitutionalized and override them ? 
i simply point out that there is the need for work to be done . 
i welcome in the exchanges in this debate the recognition by the two ministers who have spoken , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , that it is not possible to view aboriginal rights in the context of single departments isolated from each other . 
we are moving toward a comprehensive view , but it is an educational process that involves all the institutions of government and may , I respectfully suggest , involve all the members of Parliament . 
it is a learning experience for us . 
in particular , one of the things I would suggest is that there is too much absolutism in this area . 
the original theories of acquisition of rights by European settlers , whether they were British , French , German or Danish - one can run through the list - were based on absolutist theories such as terra nullius or unoccupied land . 
these theories were rejected by the International Court in 1975 and , to give credit , were accepted by the early 1980 s in Canadian thinking as incorrect . 
the evidence led to the constitution repatriation project that was accepted . 
i would also suggest that it is an equal error to proceed to other absolutist views that it is one or the other , that one party wins absolutely and one loses absolutely . 
the wise solutions here are in the recognition of comparative rights , that original so to speak inherent rights may also be subject to being balanced by supervening rights , particularly supervening rights obtained in good faith by those exercising them . 
what we are getting into is a complicated process of identifying , quantifying and balancing different competing rights . 
the solutions here , and there ample ways of doing it that require work , are in terms of comparative equities . 
the solution is never one absolutely that these are one ' s rights and everybody else loses . 
it is a complicated process of sorting out and in a way sharing . 
this is where we come back to the concept of judge and company . 
all the players are involved . 
this debate shows a recognition that some sort of long range solution is needed , but I do think we will need the courts as a part of it . 
i do not think executive legislative authority can do it alone . 
i do not think legislation can do it . 
i think the court can be brought into the processes more fully . 
those would be my suggestions to the House . 
criticisms of the court , as such , should be saved for another occasion and we will put forward suggestions for improving the court . 
we may find that the judges are very well - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am terribly sorry to interrupt , but if I did not stand I do not think the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra would sit down . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can see that you are trying to please everyone , but you should not make enemies in your own party . 
many members would like to speak , so I will ask the two questions I have . 
i am a bit surprised at the suggestion that we should go back to the court with this decision . 
let me ask first this question , just to make sure I did not misunderstand the last remarks of the hon. member opposite . 
did he say that we will have to go back to the court to get an interpretation of the decision in the Marshall case ? 
here is my second question . 
how can we deal with the situation , when the court asks us to do our job and negotiate what a moderate livelihood should mean ? 
would the hon. member care to comment ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
could the hon. member repeat his second question ? 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
i wanted to know what a moderate livelihood is . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt , but the hon. member ' s time is up . 
the hon. member for Delta - South Richmond . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member opposite raised the column by Jeffrey Simpson which appeared in the Globe and Mail . 
i quote from a couple of paragraphs : 
that court ruled in 1954 in Brown v Board of Education of Topeka that the so - called " separate but equal " doctrine used to justify segregation was unconstitutional because " separate educational facilities are inherently unequal '' . 
it is an interesting concept when applied to the fisheries here . 
Mr. Simpson went on to write : 
usually forgotten is that there were two Brown cases . 
the next year , after hearing evidence about how the 1954 ruling should be applied , the court gave school and political authorities breathing room to implement the first decision . 
the judges said authorities should act with " all deliberate speed " and required them to " make a prompt and reasonable start '' . 
they did not , in either the first or second Brown rulings , require that the next day the existing order of things be overturned . 
the court was obviously alive both to the important principles it enunciated and to the need for a period of adjustment . 
would that the Supreme Court of Canada had been so alive in the Marshall case . 
given these comments , would the member opposite not think it wise and prudent to go back to the court for a stay of judgment and a rehearing of the case to give some advise to the government ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
Mr. Speaker , that was the question of the hon. member opposite and we answered it on the general point . 
what Mr. Simpson is referring to is what in fact followed with Brown v the Board of Education No. 2 . It was a process that was before the courts over a considerable number of years , not just a one shot return . 
i have nothing against the one shot return , but I would envisage the solution of this problem , west coast logging and similar problems , a process that involves court and executive power working together , the parties constantly before the courts and over a period of years . 
in my view that would be a sophisticated solution . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
part of the problem is that we have depended upon the courts to settle these issues instead of depending upon modern day treaties where we look at some type of conclusion and closure to the entire issue . 
if we continue to fight the before the courts we will get deeper and deeper into the quagmire we are in . 
it is a mistake to go in that direction . 
i would like the member ' s comments on that and the fact that if we continue to go before the courts we should listen to what the courts have told us in every solution they have brought down . 
this is not their job . 
they do not see it as their job and they do not want it to be their job . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
Mr. Speaker , I would not put words into the mouth of the courts as to what they want and do not want . 
that seems to me to be best done by a court . 
if we go that way we are into comparative equities . 
that is what I was talking about . 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a lot has been said tonight but we need to take a look at the motion itself and pull things into perspective . 
the motion reads : 
that this House take note of the difficulties in Canadian fisheries , especially as complicated by the Queen and Marshall case and its implications for both aboriginal and non - aboriginal peoples and for the future management of natural resources . 
some have taken sides on that motion tonight . 
i want to specifically say that I am not taking sides . 
we have to recognize the decision and try to figure out a strategy as a government and as members of the parliament of Canada on how we implement that decision in a fair and reasonable way and ensure that all those players who fish and make their livelihoods at other natural resources can do so in a way that conserves the stocks and live in reasonable prosperity . 
as the motion says , we are indeed faced with a serious crisis . 
some members have mentioned this evening that this crisis seems to be escalating with the potential collapse of the voluntary moratorium negotiated by the minister last Sunday . 
i have talked to the minister a number of times about the issue . 
i know he had hoped that goodwill and tolerance would prevail . 
over the weekend the minister had gone a long way to achieving a satisfactory interim solution . 
what we really need is peace in the water and a timeframe in which to institute a regulatory plan to manage the fishery situation in a reasonable way . 
the seriousness of the situation is perhaps outlined best by a constituent of mine , Barry Murray , who is a fisherman in the Malpeque Bay area . 
he wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i will quote sections from his letter because it outlines the seriousness . 
he wrote : 
there are individuals with strong feelings on both sides of this argument , and these personalities are at a heightened state of volatility that will take very few more sparks to ignite violence . 
once started , this slippery slope may quite possibly devastate both communities . 
i am not trying to exaggerate . 
there is potential for a lobster stock crisis and community unrest that would rival the cod crisis of the early eighties . 
he closed by saying : 
Mr. Minister , please close these out of control aboriginal fisheries for conservation reasons until such a time that an agreement can be put in place that will amply protect the stocks and protect our fishing communities . 
Mr. Murray outlines the serious volatility and the serious situation in terms of the lobster fish stocks in Malpeque Bay , the area he knows best . 
i do not mind admitting I am disappointed that the supreme court did not grant a timeframe . 
it is important for us to look at the facts tonight . 
we are hearing all kinds of things , and people are basing their interpretations of what the supreme court said on the media instead of on reading the judgment . 
what did the decision say ? 
the supreme court found that Donald Marshall had a treaty right to fish for and to sell eels , which extended beyond the already established right of aboriginal people to fish for food and ceremonial purposes . 
the court also stated that this right to sell fish would be carried out within certain limits . 
section 58 of the decision states : 
what is contemplated is not a right to trade generally for economic gain but rather a right to trade for necessaries . 
the treaty right is a regulated right and can be contained by regulation within its proper limits . 
the court indicated that necessaries had been defined as moderate livelihood which according to the court in section 59 includes " such basics as food , clothing and housing supplemented by a few amenities but not the accumulation of wealth . 
it addresses day to day needs '' . 
section 61 of the decision places the limitations of the Marshall decision within context . 
according to this section it is very important that " catch limits that could reasonably be expected to produce a moderate livelihood for individual Mi ' kmaq families at present day standards can be established by regulation and enforced without violating the treaty right . 
in that case regulations would accommodate the treaty right '' . 
that is what the decision states . 
the aboriginal fishing strategy has been in place since 1992 . 
because of the Sparrow decision it was moving along the line and doing what the supreme court now recognizes as a right . 
the aboriginal fishing strategy was the government ' s response to the Sparrow decision . 
through the aboriginal fishing strategy the Government of Canada and DFO were buying licenses from retiring fishermen and turning them over to the aboriginal community so it could have a livelihood on the water as the supreme court said is its right . 
thirty - two million dollars annually has been spent on the aboriginal fishing strategy . 
the member from Delta can like it or lump it . 
those are the facts . 
the court did affirm certain rights of the Mi ' kmaq that originated with the treaties extending back to 1760 . 
what is at issue here is not the ruling but how to respond in a balanced way to the aboriginal community and the non - aboriginal community so they can survive and prosper together . 
i applaud the minister for his efforts through dialogue and co - operation . 
however , if things might be happening tonight and the fishing effort is above the amount anticipated when the minister made his decision last Sunday , I believe he should consider using his authority under section 43 of the Fisheries Act in the interest of conservation . 
at the moment the impact of even a small fishing effort on lobsters could be serious . 
let us we look at what has been happening with the government over the last number of years . 
we could go back to a release by the former minister of fisheries on April 22 , 1998 . It outlines that the November 1995 report of the Fisheries Resources Conservation Council advised that lobster fishermen were " taking too much and leaving too little '' . 
as a result of the FRCC report and as the minister of the day decided that we needed to double lobster egg production in the lobster fishing areas , new conservation measures were instituted . 
escape mechanisms were put on traps . 
lobster tariffs and sizes were increased . 
v - notching was considered . 
quite a number of management measures were imposed upon the industry . 
it is serious . 
i maintain that if there is any lobster fishing over and above what the minister anticipated on his agreement reached last Sunday , then he has the authority to act under section 43 of the Fisheries Act . 
he should take that authority and institute that action to prevent jeopardizing the future of the lobster fishery . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , even though the Liberal member who just spoke has a lot of support for his comments from the Conservative Party behind me , that does not mean to say that he is correct . 
when he said that the aboriginal fishing strategy of British Columbia was a direct result of the efforts by the government to try to enact the provisions of the Sparrow decision of the Supreme Court of Canada , he is just plain wrong , as was the judge in the R . v Houvinen case , which was recently ruled on by the British Columbia supreme court . 
the Sparrow decision of the Supreme Court of Canada expressly refused to deal with the native commercial fishery . 
that was left for subsequent cases , namely Gladstone , Vanderpeet and NTC Smokehouse . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry , we will have to ask the hon. member for Malpeque to respond to that because there are two others . 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
Mr. Speaker , I would very much love to answer that question . 
if members will recall what I said to the member for Delta - South Richmond and what I said in my remarks , it was that the government was being proactive . 
the government recognized in the Sparrow decision the right of the fishery for food and ceremonial purposes . 
we recognized as a government that there may be other treaty rights coming along and that we had to involve the aboriginal community in the fishery sector . 
we took a proactive strategy by trying to do that through the aboriginal fishing strategy to bring the aboriginal community in , in a managed way . 
that is what we were doing and we were moving well on it . 
that is what it is all about . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have never seen so many people taking part so enthusiastically in a debate on fisheries . 
i would like to ask a question of the former parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i would like to know where the member stands on what the secretary of state said . 
we just heard his call for calm to both native and non - native fishers . 
otherwise , I see a double standard . 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
i always have spoken for myself and I will continue to do that . 
i do not want to get into a numbers game . 
the numbers game has been played in the media a fair bit , that there is only such and such a number of traps . 
we have to keep in mind that in Malpeque Bay and some areas in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at this time of year they trap at about five times the rate of that in June . 
we cannot go by the trap numbers or percentages necessarily . 
if we go back to my remarks , what I argued was conservation . 
the food fishery for the native community in Malpeque Bay was shut down . 
in my view , any lobsters taken over and above the current management plans , which are already maxed out in terms of the pressure on the resource , could be considered a concern for conservation . 
we have to look at the current management plans and ensure that there is no greater effort on that resource as a result of this decision until we have the regulatory regime in place that recognizes this decision and does it in a managed way . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
how is this tardy response on this decision , which permits native fishers to enter this fishery unfettered by regulation and all the rules and regulations in place that are consistent with conservation , and his minister ' s inaction and his government ' s decision not to respond consistent with conservation ? 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
he said very clearly that there will be a regulated fishery or no fishery at all . 
what he tried to achieve through goodwill and discussion was to keep people off the water until the proper regulatory regime could be put in place . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will have to share my time with my colleague from Beauharnois - Salaberry , unless the House gives us more time . 
the motion says that speeches cannot exceed 20 minutes , but if I can have more time , I will take it . 
i took a few notes during the minister ' s speech , and since he has not yet left to catch a plane despite the advice he was given , I will take this opportunity to tell him what I think . 
we like having the opportunity to talk to him , but when there is an emergency , he should be there where he is most needed . 
all we need to do next is to define the words " moderate livelihood '' . 
it is unfortunate that at this stage I am the one who has to answer the questions . 
however , I will ask a series of questions he can answer in the questions and comments period if he wants to . 
what we are trying to get a definition of is the expression " moderate livelihood '' . 
that is the hardest thing to do here . 
and I know that the minister , who was a businessman , knows that . 
for a businessman , the hardest thing to do is to bring people to the negotiation table , but the minister ' s experience could be helpful in this instance . 
i think that the court gave some useful indications . 
i mean that when one does not want to be stuck , as we are , with a bad judgement , one tries to negotiate an agreement , even a bad one . 
in the present situation , the minister will have the opportunity to introduce legislation , to regulate fisheries . 
i recognize that the other party will not like the first set of rules . 
however , the only way to settle the issue is to go to court or sit down and negotiate . 
i imagine I am not telling the minister anything new this evening , but I am keen to see the agenda he will set . 
all we saw on the television was the minister calling for a 30 day moratorium . 
we were not told who he would be sitting down with to negotiate . 
i also noted in my speech today the fact that he intends to negotiate with the current beneficiaries , and mentioned that they are the current incarnations of the treaty signatories . 
i would like to get to know this better in good French or in business language , but I would like a complete list to be sure that there will not be other players joining a month after negotiations have begun . 
i would also like the minister to take note when I ask what he is going to do during his 30 days . 
we would need to know his agenda , what will be negotiated and who will be sitting around the table . 
certainly , there will be representatives of the fishers , other federal ministers and provincial ones too , I hope . 
the House must be reminded that , for every seafaring man , there are , as a rule of thumb , five people working on land . 
thought must be given as well to the consequences of processing . 
still in the context of what is to be prepared , when will we know exactly who will be involved in the negotiations ? 
negotiations must deal with " moderate livelihood '' , but the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans signed the UN fishing agreement this summer . 
article 5 pertains to commercial fishers as we know them and mentions that the signatory countries are committed to establishing and developing sustainable and profitable fishing . 
in this international agreement definition , I do not see the beginnings of the definition of profitable in the vocabulary of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans here in Canada . 
it is an international agreement in which all the UN countries say , each time the development of fisheries is discussed , " without subsidies '' . 
what does " without subsidies '' , as used internationally , mean in Canadian terms ? 
does it include EI ? 
does it include the interest deductions allowed by certain provinces on boats ? 
i need to know what form the profitable fisheries the minister has already administered would take , because I already imagine the moderate livelihood they have in mind for aboriginals is at least one step up from the threshold of profitability . 
i would also like to see a start made on defining the level of profitability as understood by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
one thing that worried me about the minister ' s remarks was his comment that they had not yet taken in all the implications of the decision . 
i would have preferred not to harangue the minister unduly when he is new to the job , but it is unfortunate that his department did not have a plan B , particularly when they lost . 
out of respect for native and non - native fishers , I will perhaps avoid trite plays on words here this evening but , in some cases , they have a plan B ready , and in some cases they do not . 
i would also like to know what the minister thinks about the different management styles throughout the world because , while we are on the aboriginal problem , I think that the 1867 legislation as it pertains to fisheries should also be revisited because , under the treaties , the discretionary nature of licences does not meet the aboriginal criterion . 
we should take this opportunity to dust off Canada ' s old fisheries act . 
but the most serious problem is the historic sharing between the provinces . 
if we end up having to define the resources we are going to have to give the native fishers , we will need to know where those resources are coming from . 
rather than get into individual calculations , why not take the opportunity to look into some form of sharing ? 
there are management systems and Canada is part of one in which the percentage of each participant is determined before the total allowable catch is calculated each year . 
why could what is good for Canada when it seeks to reach agreement with its colleagues outside its borders not be good for working with colleagues within its borders ? 
i ask the minister that . 
if my choice of vocabulary happens to grate on the ears of the minister or his officials , I would invite them to re - examine the French model , which speaks of stabilization criteria rather than historical share . 
in other words , I am appealing to a quality in the minister that can sometimes be a defect , but in this case can be positive . 
a businessman needs tools if he is to manage . 
in order to manage , he must be able to plan , and to know how he is going to pay for his boat and for his groceries . 
the same thing goes for an aboriginal fisher , who has to know how and where he is going to fish , and in what quantities . 
meanwhile , there are short term tools to determine what is needed to buy social peace . 
there are some people who need to make decisions about investing in a boat this winter . 
they may say to themselves that it is better for them to sell their fishing licence to Fisheries and Oceans because the size of the quota for the coming years is too unpredictable . 
the government needs to take all of this into account . 
if it does not do so as soon as possible , I think it will be irresponsible , and things will be worse than they were right after September 17 . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to ask my hon. colleague who sits on the fisheries committee , who is from the beautiful area of the Gasp é , one very simple question . 
prior to my colleague ' s speech we heard the speech of a member of the Liberal Party , the governing party , and I am singing hallelujah for this . 
they have finally recognized and are starting to believe exactly what the auditor general said last April , that shellfish stocks , mainly lobsters , are in trouble . 
this was back in April , long before the Marshall decision was rendered . 
who does the member think is responsible for the downturn in the lobster fishery which the auditor general pointed out and which DFO itself still does not recognize as a very serious problem in Atlantic Canada ? 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
i am glad the member has raised this point . 
this is something the auditor general raised . 
i know the representatives of some fishers ' associations believe the auditor general is not really the one who should decide this . 
however , there is a problem . 
the member ' s question was right and very much to the point . 
it is up to us now to look into all this . 
i would remind the House that what the auditor general said and what is contained in the report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans about the situation on the Atlantic coast - and this was a unanimous all - party report - is that everybody agrees that there is a management problem at Fisheries and Oceans and that things have to change . 
if the Marshall decision is the opportunity to start anew , I think we should seize it . 
what is being pointed out is significant . 
there is a management problem . 
i am tired of hearing the same worn out old record to the effect that it is a conservation problem when it is in fact a management problem . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has been in the Chamber tonight and he has listened to the to and fro of the debate . 
there has been a lot of discussion about the Nisga ' a treaty and about the supreme court . 
these are two issues upon which we need to shed more light . 
first of all , as was said earlier , the supreme court said in many of its earlier rulings that it does not see this as its job . 
the supreme court sees this as the job of the government . 
that is the first point . 
we do not have a modern day treaty . 
we are dependent upon supreme court judgments , which have caused serious confusion , and we have also had a lack of response from the government on this issue . 
would the member prefer a modern day treaty and consistency , or would he prefer that the supreme court deal with this so that we would have inconsistencies and a lack of response from the government ? 
what is his feeling on that ? 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
Mr. Speaker , if I understood the question , the member is asking me whether I prefer to go back to the courts or put up with further laxity and carelessness from the other side of the House . 
pardon the expression , but there is a French saying about it not mattering whether one is bitten by a dog or a bitch . 
i would not like to give the judges this responsibility , and I see that there is a lack of leadership on the other side . 
how will we , on this side of the House , find a way to put pressure on them so that they come to their senses ? 
i do not know . 
many people have suggested that the truth or the way to get out of this mess might well come from the grassroots , and I believe that . 
once the stunned reaction of our non - native fishers has passed - I believe them to be very peaceful people - they will be able to come up with solutions . 
we must have confidence in eastern Canadians . 
we have always overcome crises , and we will again . 
together , with the communities involved , we must find a way to get the government to take its responsibilities . 
but , I repeat , Grit or Tory , the problem always remains the same . 
there is a management problem at Fisheries and Oceans , and it is not for nothing that the standing committee unanimously pointed the finger not necessarily at the government but at the management style in that department . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will try to breathe a bit of life into this debate in spite of the late hour . 
i am pleased to rise after my colleague from Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , who also speaks with so much conviction when he deals with fishery matters and when he talks on our party ' s behalf on those subjects that interest him so much and for which he serves his constituency so well . 
i was also pleased to hear my colleague from Saint - Jean , our critic for aboriginal affairs , who presented his concerns on the subject debated tonight . 
i would like to remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois is really interested in this subject because of its constitutional aspect . 
it is a matter that touches on the relations between the native people , or nations as we prefer to call them in Quebec , and the other inhabitants of the country . 
we now have to participate in a debate that will have consequences for our future , the future of Quebec and the future of Canada , the relations between Quebec , Canada and the natives people who belong to one or the other of those jurisdictions . 
i have had the opportunity to hear part of the debate and I would now like to talk about constitutional issues and the Constitution , and mention that in a sovereign Quebec we will avoid problems such as those faced today by Canada as a result of the laissez - faire attitude of this government , and of its failure to truly follow through on its constitutional commitment as stated in section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , which says , and I quote the first subsection " The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed '' . 
enshrining things in the Constitution is not enough . 
native peoples know full well it is not enough to have their rights recognized and affirmed in the Constitution . 
these rights must be implemented and exercised ; the existing laws , the laws which were in force when this section came into force in 1982 must be reviewed and amended to reflect those rights . 
this is the root cause of the problem we are facing today and which is the topic of the motion before us . 
as a matter of fact , if one looks at the Marshall decision , the court says something very telling about the refusal to recognize the treaty rights at issue in this case . 
the court said , and I quote : 
" mi ' kmaq treaty rights were not accommodated in the regulations because presumably the crown ' s position was and continues to be that no such treaty rights existed '' . 
the court affirms that such were the position and the views of the crown . 
this clearly explains why regulations were adopted to give total discretion , and that discretion was exercised to deny rights granted by treaties that were , appropriately , widely and liberally interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada . 
so , it is carelessness on the part of the government that has put citizens , people sharing the land who also want to share the resource , in a crisis situation . 
we Quebecers experiencing this constitutional crisis fully understand and share the concerns of aboriginal nations , which have seen their constitutional rights trampled , a government hesitate and refuse to sit down and negotiate in good faith not only as regards the way their rights are recognized , but also the limitations that can be imposed on these rights , since the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada has led to the adoption of restrictions that are reasonable when it comes to the treaty rights of aboriginal nations . 
all this to say that , from a constitutional point of view , this shows once again the flaws of our constitution when dealing with one of the peoples of Canada , with aboriginal peoples in general . 
it did so in 1985 for 10 of them , and in 1987 for the Malecite nation . 
not only did the Quebec government recognize their existence , it also indicated its determination to conclude agreements with each of the aboriginal nations . 
in the 1985 motion , these agreements guaranteed the right to hunt , fish , trap , harvest and participate in the management of wildlife resources . 
this explicit recognition of the right to fish was expressed in a motion dating back to 1985 . 
since then , negotiations have been carried out in good faith to follow up on these commitments . 
sovereignist parties and members of this sovereignist coalition have also re - iterated the commitment they made in the 1990 s to ensure that aboriginal people would be entitled to self - government within a sovereign Quebec and would even be able to take part in the drafting of a constitution where their autonomy would be recognized . 
as we have so clearly said before , once the draft legislation on sovereignty has been proposed to Quebecers , once the bill on Quebec ' s future has been drafted , following numerous consultations of Quebecers through regional and national commissions , the Parti Quebecois ' s current agenda provides that : 
- the constitution of a sovereign Quebec recognize the right of the native people to govern themselves on lands belonging to their people and to take part in the development of Quebec . Also the current constitutional rights of aboriginal people , their treaty rights and their aboriginal titles would also be confirmed by a sovereign Quebec . 
lastly , I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois is currently considering a major proposal in which its members are also urged to re - iterate their commitment to recognizing the existing rights of the aboriginal people , to confirming these rights and to ensuring that negotiations are carried out with the native people of Quebec in order to recognize their right to self - government . 
we also stipulate in this major proposal that the relationship between the native people , a sovereign Quebec and Canada could be governed by a partnership agreement that would ensure that these people and nations continue to enjoy a friendly relationship and that the native people would not , as the supreme court said in the Marshall judgement , be considered as " citizens minus '' , but as first - class citizens in a sovereign Quebec and a sovereign Canada . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member for Vancouver Quadra mentioned that in terms of long term solutions the executive legislature and the judiciary of the supreme court should get together to work toward solutions or come up with definitive reasoning for long term solutions not only in this particular instance but in other instances . 
would the hon. member from the Bloc agree that there needs to be a joint effort between the elected officials of parliament who represent Canada and the supreme court to come to reasonable conclusions in this particular instance ? 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the supreme court has done its job . 
my colleague from Saint - Jean set out the decisions that attempted to interpret section 35 and give it content . 
the supreme court told the government that it could limit rights in order to manage and conserve the resource . 
it might be advisable for the legislators in this House to revise old legislation on fishing , as my colleague from Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok proposed , to incorporate the full scope of the ancestral and treaty rights of the aboriginal nations in a broader fishing policy . 
that seems more preferable to me than a regulation that would be adopted and selected by the government and only the government . 
i can see a role for this House in implementing ancestral and sub - treaty rights for other aboriginal nations . 
in my opinion , this House must assume its responsibilities . 
it is up to the government especially to ensure that this House assumes its responsibilities , something it does not seem to want to do at the moment . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the question raised by the NDP member and the reply from the member for Beauharnois - Salaberry brings me to another point . 
what other skeletons are the Liberals hiding in their closet ? 
are there other costs like this that we are not aware of ? 
people have a right to know . 
all of us , myself included , were kept in the dark . 
when I was a little boy , I played with friends , not knowing that they would have more rights than I do today . 
i am very glad for them , but I did not know . 
Canadians should be told once and for all what other swords of Damocles are hanging over their heads , and not necessarily just in the fishery . 
this evening , we are looking at the native problem in the context of the Maritime fisheries crisis . 
but to use a good old Maritime expression , this is perhaps just the tip of the iceberg . 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , I will only remind the House that the present crisis seems to be triggering other crises , since the Innu said that they could have additional claims relating to the Churchill Falls project . 
in British Columbia , the chief of the Nanoose first nation would like the confirmed or at least claimed rights of his people reviewed in light of the Marshall decision . 
canada probably gives them nightmares . 
this is unacceptable in a country that some people boast about being the best country in the world . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
however , knowing that there are quite a few night owls among Acadians , I am sure some of them are listening to me right now . 
it is a pleasure for me to say a few words tonight about the decision handed down by the supreme court in the Marshall case . 
this decision has been taken seriously by all Canadians , and we have been hearing about it for several weeks . 
the peace treaty was signed in 1760 and , 250 years later , we have to interpret what happened . 
we must not forget that , in those 250 years , the Conservatives were often in office , including for a period of nine years mostly in the 1980 s . 
they cannot stand up and blame the Liberals , because problems occurred when both parties formed the government . 
but , tonight , we can blame everybody . 
one thing we know is that there was a treaty . 
we can say that governments did not respond to the requests made by aboriginal people after the treaty . 
today , we have to deal with a decision which was brought about by the inaction of governments . 
fishers from my riding have contacted me to tell me that they are willing to recognize the rights of native fishers , but that we must negotiate . 
an aboriginal woman from Burnt Church was quoted last week as saying that native - white relations had been developing in the right direction over the past hundred years . 
today it seems to her that everything has to be started all over again . 
we have some responsibility in all that . 
when the decision was released , I recall that my colleague , the fisheries critic , sent a letter to the minister asking him to summon the all - party standing committee to a meeting in Ottawa in order to discuss the situation . 
last week , I myself sent a letter to the minister , with no reply . 
he is asking us all to work together . 
even today , as we speak , the all - party committee has not yet been called together to discuss the situation . 
the only thing , then , is that violence is a possibility . 
all sorts of things can happen , but in the end it is negotiation that will solve these problems . 
therefore , I am calling upon the people in my riding , as well as those in the neighbouring riding of Miramichi , to take things calmly , and to enter into negotiations in order to solve the problem . 
that is the only means to settlement . 
judging from my labour union experience , regardless of what conflicts have taken place , regardless of whether it took three months to settle them , or six , the only place there was a settlement was at the negotiating table . 
this invitation must therefore be responded to . 
the two groups , native and non - native , must be invited to the negotiating table , and it must be done as soon as possible . 
not a week from today . 
i will go even farther . 
i will tell you that I have concerns . 
are we going to wait yet again to have a crisis in the lobster industry and after that another crisis in the crab industry ? 
and after that we will respond to that crisis and then we will have another one in the herring industry and after that we will respond to the crisis in the herring industry . 
we must find a solution together . 
the government is capable of choosing an approach the fishers would agree to . 
some fishers might be ready to sell their license . 
some people who have reached the age of 55 or 60 would be prepared to retire . 
so the government could become involved in buying back their licenses and make these licenses available to the native bands in order to resolve this problem that has gone on unresolved for 250 years . 
we have a 250 year old treaty , with all the lawyers we have in Canada . 
they are intelligent enough to be in the House of Commons ? 
i am happy today not to be a lawyer . 
i am also happy that the minister is not a lawyer . 
so , perhaps we can solve the problem today . 
it took 250 years to interpret a peace treaty signed with the aboriginals . 
today , we are all panicking and we are not prepared to react after 250 years . 
we should be ashamed of our governments . 
this is why I urge you not to wait for a week . 
we cannot wait until people fight with one another . 
we cannot wait until violence erupts . 
people are concerned . 
they want to sit down , negotiate and find a solution . 
it takes leadership to achieve that . 
there are crises everywhere these days . 
there is a problem with the airlines . 
there is a problem with the immigrants arriving in the Vancouver area . 
again , the government does not know how to deal with this issue . 
there are problems everywhere . 
it is time to act before we lose control of our country . 
the federal government and the Liberals have that responsibility that Canadians have given them . 
the government waits for weeks on end , but the aboriginal people have been saying for years that they want a solution to their problems . 
when the Conservatives signed the free trade agreement , it did not take them long to adjust the whole Canadian program to free trade . 
it did not take them years to do that . 
it seems as if the issue between aboriginal and white peoples could take a year or two to solve . 
this is not true . 
we cannot have such an attitude . 
we must settle the issue now . 
we must not wait a year to do that . 
we must sit with these people and solve the problem . 
there are solutions . 
i am convinced that when fishers , aboriginals and a government that shows leadership sit together at the table , solutions will be found . 
i urge the government , I urge the minister , who just got the job , to make a name for himself by being a good Minister of Fisheries and solving the problems we are facing in Canada . 
this is what I ask him to do . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will try to be brief , because I see that members still have many questions to ask . 
i would like to tell my colleague that he is right when he says that our constituents are wondering what they will be allowed to fish , even if they are not fishing lobster right now . 
he mentioned those who fish herring or crab . 
i would like the member to tell us what we can do to get the Liberals to see reason . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague for his question . 
he spoke about the harmonized GST and said that the matter was settled quickly . 
it does not mean , however , that we , the people of the Atlantic , welcomed it . 
but they did it anyway and it did not take long . 
i wish to thank the government for having allowed us , tonight , to discuss part of the problem . 
after all , I hope the minister , who is here tonight , who is listening to what we have to say , can react . 
we must act now and force the government to act and tell it that if it does not , it should not ask us to work with it . 
if it does not act , it should not tell us that we are unwilling to co - operate because , tonight , we are working with it and offering solutions . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I heard a fair amount of discussion tonight from the NDP members who rose to speak . 
there was discussion earlier that they had been in contact with fishermen who live in the South Shore riding and in West Nova riding . 
i was at the meeting in Yarmouth . 
i did not see any NDP members of Parliament there . 
i have talked with hundreds of fishermen and I have not talked to one who has been in contact with these NDP members of Parliament . 
i have listened to what these members have said , which is little better than nothing . 
what I now want to know is simple and I want a straightforward answer . 
would the New Democratic Party support a moratorium on this decision immediately to allow time for first nations , fishers and DFO to sit down and formulate a plan for the peaceful integration of first nations into the fishery ? 
will it support an immediate moratorium on this decision ? 
Mr. Yvon Godin : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very sad that after 250 years these members still cannot recognize that we have a problem and at the Supreme Court of Canada has made a decision . 
that is why I am recommending that we be at the negotiating table tomorrow morning to negotiate something with the two groups who are the non - natives and the native people . 
the member talked about the NDP not doing or saying anything . 
i was on a radio station the other day when my colleague from Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac said that it was not the government ' s responsibility to resolve the problem but the responsibility of the community and that the community was destroying itself right now . 
it is the responsibility of the government to come down and resolve the problem with the people down home and get to the table . 
we have spoken to more fishermen than you ever have as a Conservative . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i would like to remind hon. members to address each other through the Chair please . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is getting late in the evening and it looks as if I may be the last speaker on this very valuable debate . 
i want to thank the Conservative Party ' s House leader for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough for bringing forward this issue for a take note debate . 
it is too bad it is not an emergency debate . 
i also wish to thank the government for allowing us this take note debate . 
i hope the it is understanding the very serious nature of this issue . 
my colleague from New Brunswick mentioned that this is not just about lobsters . 
this is about every single fish species that we have , not only in Atlantic Canada but clearly right across the country . 
aboriginal people in our prairie provinces are looking at the Marshall decision to see what it means to their role at the FFMC that they have in Winnipeg . 
they have great problems with that . 
aboriginal people on the west coast are looking at this decision in terms of what they believe are their timber rights and their fishing rights . 
people across the country are very seriously concerned about what this decision means in their lives . 
it is not just about lobsters . 
we are talking about the lobster issue right now because tomorrow morning area 35 , the Bay of Fundy region in Nova Scotia - New Brunswick , will be opening up to the commercial fishery which normally opens up this time of year . 
those men and women will be putting out their boats and going out to catch lobsters . 
we have still not heard a word from the government on how it plans to incorporate the Marshall decision with the aboriginal people to get them into this fishery . 
we have heard from people like Mr. Arthur Bull of the Coastal Community Network of Digby who said they have been working overtime , literally day and night since this decision , to come up with reasonable compromises so that both sides , the aboriginal and the non - aboriginal people , can work together . 
unfortunately there is nothing but silence from the minister ' s department and the government . 
therein lies the problem . 
obviously the minister is getting his advice from what I consider to be very elderly and tired people on the east coast in terms of DFO , people I have had many concerns about in terms of their management policies . 
the Liberal government from 1993 to 1999 has done absolutely nothing . 
the attitudes of the Conservative government and the Liberal government toward aboriginal people in the nation have been very much paternalistic . 
that is exactly what the aboriginal people have done . 
they have gone to court and now the court has rendered its decision . 
whether or not we like it , it is the legal opinion of the country . 
if we start doing that to the Supreme Court of Canada within our constitution we are opening up a bigger can of worms than opposition members or anyone else who is claiming that would be the solution . 
i am going to give the minister four very concrete points on how he could come up with a short term solution . 
one is to immediately reconvene the all party standing committee of fisheries and oceans down in the maritime region . 
the minister and his department obviously refuse to go down there on a long term basis to deal with the issue . 
perception is everyone ' s reality . 
they cannot be seen to be making decisions from Ottawa for Atlantic Canada . 
they must be in Atlantic Canada to put the human and financial resources on the table . 
the grassroots people who work the resource know the resource better than the minister and most politicians in this room . 
they know what the short and long term solutions are . 
the minister must commit the human and financial resources for them to carry on their work . 
second , the minister must consider a voluntary buyout package and a transfer of the licences over to the Mi ' kmaq nation to include them in the fishery . 
the government must find out exactly how many licences would be required on the short term to bring the aboriginal people into the fishery . 
this is very important because conservation is the key . 
everybody must fish under the same conservation guidelines . 
i do not think there is any debate on that . 
the auditor general said last April that lobster stocks , and in fact all shellfish stocks , were in trouble in Atlantic Canada . 
many people criticize the auditor general and me for espousing those views . 
the fact is the auditor general was absolutely correct . 
last April he said that the management policies which caused the cod collapse in 1992 were the same policies in place to handle the groundfish stocks . 
let us not forget that in the spring the Mi ' kmaq asked the Government of Canada to sit at the table to come up with solutions for the short term because they suspected that the Marshall decision would go in their favour . 
they came with an open hand to government asking it to come up with solutions so we can evade the problems that are happening now . 
my colleague from South Shore and my colleague from West Nova are absolutely correct when they say they have never felt the tensions greater than they are now . 
they are absolutely correct when they say that . 
the fact is that the government by sitting back in Ottawa trying to come up with some solution it can grab out of the sky or grab out of the air will not solve the problems . 
government members have to go down there and talk directly to the people involved . 
they must do that in order to add calm to the equation of the argument that is happening right now . 
another thing that has happened within DFO is severe budget cuts to the department itself . 
the department does not have the human or financial resources to monitor enforcement policies , so it calls upon the RCMP to help . 
however , that department ' s resources were cut as well . 
the fact is that we do not even have the proper resources allocated right now in order to protect the stock . 
that is the most important thing . 
it is not just lobster stock but all other shellfish species out there as well . 
if the auditor general was correct and they do collapse , it will make the cod prices look like a drop in the bucket . 
again , the responsibility falls upon this government . 
every single member in this argument today , my colleagues in the Conservative Party , the Reform Party , the Bloc Quebecois and ourselves , has asked for and demanded leadership on this issue . 
it is imperative that the minister show leadership . 
he should get down there and start talking to these people . 
he should not do it from Ottawa . 
this is very important . 
while he is down there discussing this issue , he should seriously consider a community based allocation of these stocks . 
Mr. Arthur Bull of Digby has asked many , many times of the Coastal Community Network of Atlantic Canada and those in western Canada as well to get away from the corporatization of our fish stocks which have concentrated the wealth of the fish stocks in very few hands . 
it is time to start looking at a community based strategy so that all people , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , can work together for the long term benefit of this resource . 
we also have to include what the corporate sector is saying right now . 
they have been very , very silent . 
we have all been working very hard trying to concentrate on protecting the interests of the inshore fishermen . 
what is needed now is leadership from this government . 
this government should not be an ostrich and put its head in the sand and hope the problem goes away . 
government members must get down there and work with the people toward immediate short term solutions that have been presented by all members of the House today . 
they must incorporate those ideas so that we can have a calm fishery . 
we will all benefit in the long term . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
before we go to questions and comments , I want to remind everyone once again to address each other through the Chair . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
for example , the Supreme Court of Canada failed to accurately describe moderate living . 
some native advocates contend that a net annual income of $ 80,000 is a moderate living . 
the Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether the aboriginal tax free status which exists would reduce needed fishery earnings . 
the Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether government contributions to aboriginal communities through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development can offset earnings required from the fishery . 
the Supreme Court of Canada did not determine whether non - status Mi ' kmaq or Maliseet are legally able to participate in the fishery . 
there are an unknown number of non - status Mi ' kmaq or Maliseet , but it is estimated in the tens of thousands . 
DFO is determined that non - status Mi ' kmaq or Maliseet are not eligible under the treaty . 
this will probably be met with a court challenge . 
all I am saying is that these issues will come before the court sooner or later . 
why not do it sooner ? 
why not get the answers now before we go down a garden path that we do not want to be going down ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the question . 
we are the elected officials of this country . 
my colleagues from the Reform Party , the Conservative Party , the Bloc and the Liberal Party , we are the ones who are responsible ultimately to answer to the constituents of this country for legislation . 
if previous Conservative governments and the current Liberal government have refused to negotiate and to legislate , then it is quite obvious that the supreme court will dictate to us what it interprets as the rules and what it interprets as the law . 
once it does this , whether we like the decision or not , we have to live with it . 
we find ourselves in the pickle we are in today because of the failed policies of the current Liberal government and past Conservative governments where they have refused to negotiate long term solutions for the resources of this country . 
it is up to parliament to finally decide this issue . 
it is not up to the supreme court . 
it is our responsibility as parliamentarians to take this issue very seriously . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is absolutely right . 
would the NDP support a moratorium on the decision to allow time for first nations , fishers and DFO to sit down and formulate a plan for the peaceful integration of first nations into the licensed fishery ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , if I may throw the question back so he can ask it of me again . 
is the member for South Shore asking me about a moratorium on the aboriginal fishery or about a moratorium on the non - aboriginal fishery ? 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , right now we have a supreme court decision dealing with the aboriginal fishery . 
i suggested a moratorium on the aboriginal fishery because that is the only non - licensed fishery out there . 
any licensed fishery , any aboriginal boats that are involved in the licensed fishery would not be subject to it . 
we are only dealing with what the supreme court decision brought down . 
will the NDP support that ? 
i see no other way or plan to bring everyone to the table to allow for the resolution of this matter . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , as much as I would like to say yes to that solution in order to bring some calm to the irrationality , I cannot . 
it is not up to us to break the law . 
the fact is that the supreme court has ordered that . 
it has laid down quite clearly that the aboriginal people have the right to fish in this regard . 
i do not like the idea of their fishing without proper conservation guidelines and without working under the same rules everyone else does . 
however the fact is we cannot override the supreme court decision and say quite clearly that because we are in a mess and a pickle and because parliamentarians and government have screwed this issue up so badly that we are now going to say to the aboriginal people who have waited 240 years for their right that they can no longer do what the supreme court has said they can do . 
the majority of people I have spoken to down there are willing to incorporate the aboriginal fishery into the fishery . 
this is what needs to happen , dialogue and conversation and not useless rhetoric . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the final dying moments of this debate . 
i begin by congratulating the minister of fisheries who in a rare show of interest and willingness to listen to opposition members has stayed here in the House . 
even against the advice of some members of the House that he should be in New Brunswick or in Nova Scotia , he has stayed here and has genuinely listened to and participated in the debate . 
i and other members of this party appreciate that effort and show of good faith . 
i must take him up on a comment he made in his remarks that he had acted quickly . 
we have to revisit the chronology of what has taken place . 
on September 17 the Marshall decision was handed down by the supreme court . 
he said that he acted within three days . 
but what happened ? 
from that point we know that on September 27 the minister spoke of implementing some form of a response , a government action , to inform all stakeholders of what the government intended to do . 
that did not come about . 
on October 9 the chiefs of the aboriginal communities stated that they were willing to embark on the possibility of a moratorium . 
on October 13 , after meeting with the minister , hours after he had departed the maritimes , the chiefs themselves imposed a moratorium . 
it was a self - imposed pre - emptive move to give the government time to respond and to formulate its response . 
sadly , communications have now completely broken down to the point where we know the moratorium is no longer in place . 
the chiefs have decided they will not abide by the self - imposed moratorium . 
that is problematic . 
we can engage in all kinds of partisan rhetoric . 
it is very easy for the Reform and the NDP to cast aspersions on current and past governments , having never had the luxury of having to make those tough decisions . 
it is a very easy thing to do , making statements that are not true . 
it does not make them true simply because they are said in this place . 
the clock is ticking . 
there is more than just preservation of stocks at stake ; there is preservation of human lives at stake . 
the potential for violence is real . 
it has already been played out in certain communities like Burnt Church and it is also on the tip of breaking out in parts of Nova Scotia , on the South Shore in particular and in parts of Cape Breton Island . 
in my riding of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough there are many aboriginal participants already in the commercial fishery . 
there is the ability for peaceful entry into this industry . 
that has been displayed in the past . 
that offer has been extended in the past and I assume it will be extended in the future . 
timeliness is the issue now . 
i know the minister is sincere in his efforts and in his words to find the solutions , but there is little time to waste . 
the minister must be proactive . 
we support him in his efforts to find the solutions , but those solutions will only come from the input of all stakeholders , including aboriginals and non - aboriginal fishers who have an equally important stake in the outcome . 
given what the supreme court has handed down , given this dark abyss that is now before us , it does not just pertain to fisheries , as we have heard many times in the debate this evening . 
this goes far beyond one single industry . 
this is the tip of the iceberg and the government is steaming toward that iceberg unless it acts quickly . 
with the closing moments of the debate I implore the minister to continue on the road he is on , but to do so in a very pragmatic and measured way , and to listen to the stakeholders who are equally sincere and have the greatest stake in the resolution of the matter . 
i encourage him to do so with post - haste . 
we do support him in that and I sincerely wish him the very best in finding the solutions that will appease all of those who are looking for a peaceful resolution to the matter . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the comments of my colleagues who represent areas which are farther north of my riding in Nova Scotia . 
his previous colleague asked about the moratorium on the aboriginal fishery and he just said that what we require are peaceful negotiations in that regard . 
does he believe that if the government enforced a moratorium on the aboriginal aspects of the fishery that it would lead and be conducive to peaceful negotiations and dialogue with the non - native people ? 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously an even - handed approach is needed . 
one approach being suggested , that we would single out the aboriginals who have now been given this right by the supreme court and attempt to enforce it in a way that is unfettered , is unacceptable . 
obviously the minister is not about to single out one of the two groups in the divide . 
that I suggest would only lead to further confrontation and further violence . 
the difficulty is that this is a tinderbox that is absolutely on the verge of an explosion . 
i do not mean to restate the obvious , but the minister has to act quickly . 
this is something that is going to get out of control like wildfire in an instant . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
pursuant to order made earlier this day , it being 12 o ' clock midnight , the motion shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and the House shall adjourn . 
it being 12 o ' clock midnight the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
( the House adjourned at 12.00 a.m. )

competition ACT 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 201 , an act to amend the Competition Act ( protection of those who purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers who compete with them at retail ) . 
contrary to the belief of some , I would like to reiterate that rumours of the bill ' s death have been greatly exaggerated by the industry committee and others . 
the bill , along with the amendments to be put forward by my colleague , the hon. member for Cambridge , seeks to accomplish just one thing : to prohibit vertically integrated suppliers from charging their wholesale customers more for a product than what they or their affiliates are charging for the same product at the retail level . 
in terms of unjustifiable and high sustained prices , the bill tries to prevent market domination in the grocery and gas industries as well as others . 
i look forward to the continuing debate on this renewed bill . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is the hon. member suggesting the bill was in the same form as in the previous Parliament ? 
Mr. Dan McTeague : 
Mr. Speaker , the bill itself is a votable bill under the procedures that have been changed as a result of last year . 
the bill is in virtually the same form . 
it is in the same form as it was in the previous Parliament . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that the bill is in the same form as Bill C - 235 was at the time of the prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament . 
therefore , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the bill is deemed read the second time , referred to a committee , considered in committee , and reported with amendments .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 202 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( flight ) . 
i am sorry about monopolizing the time in the context of my former bill C - 235 . 
i thank the House leader for the Reform Party . 
the bill was presented in the last session . 
it deals with a specific provision in the Criminal Code dealing with those who evade police in pursuit . 
the bill provides severe penalties for anyone using a motor vehicle to escape from the police and in the process kills , injures or maims another person . 
over the summer Canadians once again saw the tragic outcome caused by those who use motor vehicles to evade the police . 
in Toronto another family no longer has a loved one . 
in Sudbury another police officer was added to the list of those killed in the line of duty . 
the bill has the support of the Minister of Justice , the Government of Ontario and the Canadian Police Association . 
i am confident that given its previous reception by the justice committee the bill will also obtain the support of the House in the very near future . 
the bill is in the same form as the previous bill in the last parliament . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that the bill is in the same form as Bill C - 440 was at the time of prorogation of the 1 st session of the 36 th parliament . 
accordingly , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) the bill is deemed read the second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights . 
( bill read the second time and referred to a committee )

auditor GENERAL ACT 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 203 , an act to amend the Auditor General Act ( Poverty Commissioner ) . 
the bill is the same in form as Bill C - 490 , which I introduced in the House of Commons during the preceding session . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is of the opinion that this bill is in the same form as Bill C - 490 was when the first session of the 36 th Parliament was prorogued . 
therefore , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the order for second reading of this bill will be placed at the bottom of the order of precedence in the Order Paper . 
* * * 
employment INSURANCE ACT 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 204 , an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act ( parental benefits ) . 
the 1996 national longitudinal survey on children and youth found that 25 % of Canadian children enter adult life with significant emotional , behavioural , academic or social problems . 
the bill responds in part to the need to provide more flexibility , options and choices to parents by amending the Employment Insurance Act to provide up to one full year of maternity and parental leave benefits under that act . 
i am pleased to reintroduce the bill and I hope we will have the support of the entire House .

income TAX ACT 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 205 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( deduction of expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in employment ) . 
this bill is at the same stage and in the same form as was Bill C - 502 at the time of prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament , and I am requesting that it be reinstated in the order of precedence . 
i would remind hon. members that this bill was a votable item . 
i would remind the government House leader that , in the rather chaotic end of session last June 10 , I had to cut 20 minutes off my speech . 
he had then given me his consent to have another 20 minutes to speak . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the chair is of the opinion that this bill is at the same stage as was Bill C - 502 at the time the first session of the 36 th Parliament was prorogued . 
consequently , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the order for second reading of this bill will be placed at the bottom of the order of precedence in the Order Paper and it will be designated as a votable item .

access TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 206 , an act to amend the Access to Information Act and to make amendments to other acts . 
what it does is substantially reforms the Access to Information Act . 
i have 112 seconders to this bill , mainly from the Liberals , the Reform and the Bloc Quebecois . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to introduce the former Bill C - 461 , an act to amend the Criminal Code to prohibit coercion in medical procedures that offend a person ' s religion or belief that human life is inviolable . 
the seconder for the bill is the hon. member for Huron - Bruce . 
the purpose of the bill is to ensure that health providers working in medical facilities of various kinds will never be forced to participate against their wills in procedures such as abortions or acts of euthanasia . 
the bill itself does not ban abortion or euthanasia , but it makes it illegal to force another person to participate in an abortion procedure or an act of euthanasia . 
incredibly there are medical personnel in Canada who have been fired because the law is not explicit enough in spelling out their conscience rights . 
the bill will make those rights explicit .

crown LIABILITY AND PROCEEDINGS ACT 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to reintroduce this bill . 
its purpose is to ensure that a person serving time in prison will not be able to sue the federal government or its employees under any federal legislation in respect of a claim arising while the person is under sentence . 
if enacted , the bill would put an end to the practice of prisoners engaging in frivolous lawsuits against the federal government and their abuse of the legal system . 
i urge all members in the House to give serious consideration to the bill . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

criminal CODE 
it would thus make it a criminal offence for an adult to engage in sex with children under the age of 16 . 
the bill was first introduced in 1996 and reintroduced in 1997 . 
however , the growing concern over child pornography and child prostitution in the country makes it even more urgent for the enactment of this legislation to protect the young and vulnerable in our society from predators among us . 
for the sake of our children I appeal to members of the House to give serious consideration to the bill and lend their support accordingly .

income TAX ACT 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 211 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( travel expenses for a motor vehicle used by a forestry worker ) . 
this legislation seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to allow a reasonable tax deduction for forestry workers who work far from their place of residence , so that the Income Tax Act is an incentive to work and not the reverse . 
this bill is in response to a request made by several forestry workers in my riding and in my region . 
these people deserve to be encouraged . 
when a person agrees to travel 300 , 400 , 500 or 600 kilometres to make a living , it is normal that the government should grant a corresponding deduction .

Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 212 , an act to amend the Canada Labour Code , the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act , and the Public Service Staff Relations Act ( prohibited provision in a collective agreement ) . 
the bill ' s purpose is to prohibit clauses in collective agreements that discriminate against new arrivals in the labour market and to ensure that these workers enjoy the same pay and benefits as previously hired workers .

Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 213 , an act to promote shipbuilding , 1999 . 
basically , it consists of three measures : a loan guarantee program specific to shipbuilding ; a leasing write - off provision ; a shipbuilding tax credit similar to the one that already exists in Quebec . 
these three measures were proposed two years ago by the Canadian shipbuilders ' association and had the support of the interunion coalition of 4,000 shipbuilding workers in Canada .

business OF THE HOUSE 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) moved : 
that , during the first thirty sitting days of the present Session of Parliament , whenever a Minister of the Crown , when proposing a motion for first reading of a public bill , states that the said bill is in the same form as a bill introduced by a Minister of the Crown in the previous session , if the Speaker is satisfied that the said bill is in the same form as at prorogation , notwithstanding Standing Order 71 , the said bill shall be deemed in the current session to have been considered and approved at all stages completed at the time of prorogation of the previous session . 
i would then later ask for two other motions to be put as well . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
does the House give its unanimous consent to proceed in the manner outlined by the government House leader ?

petitions 
gasoline ADDITIVES 
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I wish to present a petition which has been certified correct as to form and content . 
the petitioners are from the Grand Bend and London areas . 
the petition states that the use of the additive MMT in Canadian gasoline presents an environmental problem affecting every man , woman and child in Canada . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to set by the end of this calendar year national clean fuel standards for gasoline with zero MMT and low sulphur content . 
the CONSTITUTION 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to table a petition incited by the hon. member of the New Democratic Party as being a problem in this country . 
the petitioners ask the House that parliament oppose any amendments to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or any other federal legislation which will provide for the exclusion of reference to the supremacy of God in our Constitution and laws . 
the petitioners also mention that the majority of Canadians believe in the God who created heaven and earth and are not offended by the mention of his name in the preamble of the charter of rights and freedoms . 
this is tabled for the attention of the House and for the attention of the hon. member of the NDP who created this mess in the first place . 
agriculture 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to table that are of the same nature with respect to agriculture . 
there are 122 pages of signatures .

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 52 I request leave to make a motion for adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration . 
over the summer months it became evident that a crisis exists in our immigration and refugee determination system . 
canada has become a primary target for illegal migration . 
this is causing a problem with queue jumping . 
people who are using the normal process are extremely concerned that their process is being held up as a result of poor handling of the refugee determination process by the government . 
there are three recent events I would like to quickly refer to which demonstrate the need for an emergency debate . 
i do not think it is acceptable in a country like Canada to have a system that is working so poorly that people are being detained for months and years while they await the outcome of the determination process . 
second , Mayor Lastman , the mayor of Toronto , Canada ' s largest city , has publicly expressed concern about our immigration system , in particular our refugee determination system which is working so poorly that it is putting an extra cost burden on his city . 
he wants the government rather than the city to bear that burden if the government is not going to fix the system . 
third , yesterday , according to media reports the premier of Ontario has written a letter to the government and to the immigration minister saying he is fed up with the system working so poorly . 
he wants the government to fix the system because his province cannot bear the costs . 
it is important that we debate this issue immediately to send a signal to people smugglers and those who would use their services that Canada will no longer be an easy mark . 
we must put in place legislation that will make this process happen within days and weeks rather than months and years as is currently the situation and which will quickly end the virtual slave trade that is building in our country . 
people smugglers are bringing people in illegally and putting them into slave - like conditions . 
that is something Canadians cannot accept . 
for those reasons , it is important that we have an emergency debate today to change the law to fix these problems . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair appreciates the intervention of the hon. member for Lakeland . 
it is the view of the Chair that his application for an emergency debate does not meet the exigencies of the standing order at this time . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
during the remainder of the debate on the Speech from the Throne the Reform Party members will be dividing their speaking time . 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for Parkdale - High Park . 
as in the last six years , Canada continues to be the UN ' s choice as the number one country in which to live . 
this week ' s throne speech set out a strategy that will ensure we maintain our number one ranking . 
it signalled the government ' s plan to build on the quality of life for all Canadians . 
in the years to come we will address the challenges of globalization and the demands placed on a knowledge based society . 
we have committed to bring down the personal income tax levels of Canadians and to invest in families and in children . 
the government has set out a plan that addresses our diversity and responds to our responsibilities as a global leader . 
today I will take some time to explore this throne speech and how it relates to my riding and the constituents of Kitchener Centre . 
first I would like to review the government ' s record . 
let me begin with unemployment rates . 
they are at their lowest level since 1990 . 
i am pleased to report to this House that the Waterloo region has the lowest unemployment rate among municipal centres across the nation , a rate of 4.9 % . 
we have consistently increased our investments in research and technology and we have supported small and medium size enterprises . 
in my community Industry Canada has worked in partnership on the creation of the business enterprise centre which houses the Canada - Ontario Business Service Centre . 
this centre provides one stop shopping for entrepreneurs . 
users of the centre have access to extensive and current information and tools which enable them to both succeed and grow . 
the region of Waterloo is a microcosm of the changes that are happening across the nation . 
a generation ago no one could have envisaged a vibrant local economy that lacked the kind of family businesses such as Seagram ' s and Labatt ' s , nor could they have imagined the changes that we have seen at Schneider ' s meats , yet these changes have occurred . 
today in Kitchener we see an ever increasing number of small businesses starting up . 
across the country over 80 % of the new jobs created are by this sector and many are in the high tech area . 
Waterloo region has seen incredible growth in the high tech sector . 
our community has not only thrived but remained on the cutting edge of a competitive global economy . 
this week ' s throne speech clearly indicates a strong commitment to building our economy through developing a skilled labour force and providing the necessary research dollars and tools for small emerging companies . 
the Liberal government will ensure that skilled development keeps pace with the evolving industries and markets . 
this will be accomplished through the sectoral councils in close consultation with industry leaders . 
the government has once again acknowledged the importance of foreign investors in Canada . 
for Canada ' s technology triangle this is good news . 
the CTT has been funded by the federal government to attract foreign investors to areas such as Kitchener . 
they are working and spreading the news about Canada . 
it is this type of organization with which we must encourage and foster relationships . 
we must also support companies that will help us meet our environmental obligations under agreements such as the Kyoto protocol . 
our environment is also affected by our infrastructure . 
as a former regional and municipal representative I have witnessed the benefits of working in partnership on programs such as our national physical infrastructure . 
in the throne speech we have indicated our will to continue to work with all levels of government and the private sector to achieve a five year plan for improving the infrastructure in both urban and rural areas across Canada . 
this will be a commitment that will be reached by the end of the year 2000 . 
children and youth are the country ' s key to success in the 21 st century . 
it is the responsibility of government and community , family , friends and teachers to open doors and encourage young people to seize their dreams . 
i first entered politics to assure that the decisions of government were working in the best interests of my four children . 
during my 10 years as a member of parliament I have taken special interest in the youth of Kitchener . 
through visits to classrooms and graduations , I have had the pleasure to meet the young people who will be the leaders of tomorrow . 
i have been pleased to support organizations such as the KOR Gallery and art studio . 
this studio was created by another mother who wanted to see the greatest opportunities possible for her very talented son and other young artists in the Waterloo region . 
KOR Gallery has been supported by the federal government and has received half a million dollars throughout its years . 
in the spring of this year the Prime Minister ' s task force on youth entrepreneurship spent a day in my community meeting with young entrepreneurs and visiting their businesses . 
the task force heard that our youth need support to gain access to funding and resources . 
we are responding to those requests . 
our goal is to give today ' s young generation of Canadians , no matter where they live , the tools and the opportunities for personal success in the knowledge economy . 
we will provide them with career information and access to work experience and learning . 
we will hire them to work on Internet projects . 
we will offer them the opportunity to apply their talents overseas through youth international internship programs . 
for example , this past summer Kitchener was the proud host of the skills Canada competition . 
the event , in connection with two other competitions , received $ 800,000 from the youth employment strategy fund . 
skills Canada is an important project because it gives our youth the opportunity to compete with young people from around the world . 
the competition tested participants in over 40 trade , technological and other skill areas . 
i can think of no better way to encourage tomorrow ' s leaders . 
our children and our families deserve a high standard of living . 
this will require , as never before , an adaptable , resilient population that is ready to learn throughout life . 
it is clear that the foundation for such capacities is laid in the very early years of life . 
i firmly believe that the strength of our society will depend on the investments we make today as a nation in families and in children . 
the government has committed to making a third significant investment in the national child benefit by the year 2002 . 
we will put more dollars in the hands of families with children through further tax relief . 
we will lengthen and make more flexible employment insurance benefits for parental leave . 
we have been responding to these areas in the past years and we will continue to be committed to these issues . 
this nation has a high quality of life . 
it is a nation of which we should be proud . 
it is a nation that others envy . 
our Prime Minister has provided us with a strong direction and an unwavering commitment for unity . 
the new millennium will be wonderful for all Canadians . 
the new millennium will be a bright one for all Canadians . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with all the fluff that flies around here it is a wonder we do not break out with allergies . 
i wonder if the member has ever visited the reserves across our country , as I have for the last two years , to see the quality of life . 
the government continually talks about how wonderful we are in this land . 
i wonder if the member of parliament has ever walked the streets of Toronto , Vancouver or other major cities and visited with the people who are on the streets , who are homeless , who are experiencing this wonderful quality of life we keep hearing about from this minister . 
i wonder if the member and the government recognize the extreme value of Mike Harris , Ralph Klein and other premiers , and how much they have contributed and sacrificed in order to make things happen in their provinces , with no thanks to this government . 
in spite of the government , they have managed to achieve many things . 
i wonder if the member is aware that only this morning it was declared that there has been a 66 % increase in poverty in one year . 
one out of every six children is going to school hungry . 
one year ago it was not that bad . 
i wonder if the member is proud of a government that spends money to hang dead rabbits in a museum or to form a committee to study whether we should have a national insect . 
the government is doing all this funny fuzzy spending while we get these kinds of reports . 
what kind of a record is that ? 
what are the member and the government going to do about these things that are real and actual , that are happening on our reserves and on the streets of our country ? 
we talk about the quality of life while we hang dead rabbits in museums and search for a national insect . 
when is the government going to wake up , and what is the member going to do about it ? 
Mrs. Karen Redman : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the member opposite for the temporary promotion to minister . 
i had the pleasure this past summer of going to the Arctic region and the Northwest Territories of this land and was very proud to see the process in place for self - government . 
as recently as last April we saw the creation of Nunavut . 
i will tell the member that the government is working very hard with our aboriginal people , who do not speak with one voice , to come up with self - government and empower them to use their voices to create what the next century will look like for them . 
i also point out for the member opposite , if he would like to look at the Speech from the Throne , that there is reference made to the social union . 
one of the things that the social union does is allow all levels of government , with the leadership of the federal government , to stop pointing fingers at each other and to engage in solutions of the kind the Minister of Labour has heard in communities as she crossed Canada looking at the homelessness issue and looking at a variety of ways that all governments can work together to solve this problem . 
it is a national concern of the government , but not one that merely demands having money thrown at it . 
the social union structure allows Canadians to hold all levels of government accountable . 
the one thing the government will not do is risk financial gains by having a balanced financial picture and dressing down the deficit . 
we will not run deficits to give tax cuts , which is happening in Ontario . 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pride that I rise today in the House of Commons as a member of the government to address the Speech from the Throne , a speech which I can proudly say has been heralded as a return to traditional Liberalism . 
i would like to thank our new governor general for her eloquent delivery of the Speech from the Throne and I congratulate her on her appointment . 
the Government of Canada cannot undertake this strategy alone . 
it can only do so in partnership and in collaboration , by working together with other governments , the provinces and the territories , the private sector , the volunteer sector and individuals . 
in fact , there is not a page in the Speech from the Throne which does not note the importance of working together or use the words " collaboration " or " partnership '' . 
at the very beginning of the Speech from the Throne it is stated unequivocally as follows : 
the best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians . 
as a passionate advocate of Canada ' s arts and culture and as the member of parliament for a constituency which is home to many of Canada ' s artists , including writers , singers , actors , performers , filmmakers and producers , I had started to hear concerns that investments in Canada ' s culture had become stagnant , that other interests and interest groups had overshadowed the importance of a continued investment in the arts. 
i was actually confronted with concerns that the last two budgets had not addressed any new programs or incentives for our arts and cultural sectors , save and except those programs which had been envisaged in red book II , the Liberal election platform . 
while those programs and funding proposals had indeed been implemented , the fact still remained that these were not new commitments . 
where was the vision for this sector that would lead Canada into the next century and ensure our cultural sovereignty and our national identity ? 
the concerns voiced by the arts community have been addressed and I applaud the government on its vision and leadership in continuing to promote our Canadian arts and cultural sectors . 
the following are the themes that I trust will reassure and enhance our arts and cultural communities . 
the government is now committed to ensuring that younger Canadians , from age 13 , are given an opportunity to apply their creative abilities by providing them with a chance to produce their first works using traditional approaches and new technologies in the arts , cultural , digital and other industries . 
this commitment acknowledges the importance of arts in making children creative and preparing them for a knowledge based economy . 
there is substantial empirical evidence to show that children who are exposed to the arts , especially music , at a very early age score much higher on the math and science components of the SAT examinations than those who are not exposed . 
in November 1997 an article appeared on the front page of the arts section of the Globe and Mail which confirmed this evidence and concluded that arts , not computers , make kids creative . 
the article stated : 
arts education is not only cheaper , it may be essential training for a more creative flexible world . 
arts , not IBM , makes kids smarter . 
the article also went on to say that arts education by focusing on the creative process prepares our youth for the highly skilled jobs that our country requires and will require in the future . 
this statement gives new meaning and life to the maxim that culture is a third pillar of our foreign policy . 
the government also committed to use the upcoming WTO negotiations to build a more transparent rules based trading system which not only provides for better access in world markets for Canadian companies in all sectors but also respects the needs of Canadians , especially culture as is noted . 
it will put collections from the National Archives , the National Library and other key institutions on line . 
specifically the speech also notes and vows to increase support for the production of Canadian stories and images in print , theatre , film , music and video , and the government has committed to increase support for the use of new media . 
in dealing with physical infrastructure the government has agreed that it will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach agreement on a five year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural communities across the country . 
one of the areas of focus specifically noted for physical infrastucture was culture . 
in the city of Toronto plans are under way to build a new state of the art opera house . 
in Winnipeg the Manitoba Theatre Centre , at 41 years of age and Canada ' s oldest English speaking regional theatre , is in desperate need of repair . 
this need has also launched a private sector campaign to refurbish its two buildings . 
this theme brings new hope to a request by the cultural community to restore funding for the arts in general and infrastructure matters in particular . 
more important , this commitment to improve physical infrastructure for culture appears to be a direct response to recommendations 32 and 33 of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage report entitled " A Sense of Place , A Sense of Being : 
the Evolving Role of the Federal Government in Support of Culture in Canada '' , which was tabled in the House of Commons in June . 
these recommendations call upon the Government of Canada to re - establish a capital fund and a long term financial strategy to deal with Canada ' s deteriorating cultural facilities . 
i applaud the government for its quick response to the committee ' s report . 
in the section of the Speech from the Throne entitled " Canada ' s Place in the World '' , the government stated that it would act like like - minded countries to reform and strengthen international institutions such as the World Trade Organization . 
it also specifically noted that it would work to develop a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world . 
this commitment is a direct endorsement of the report of the cultural industries sectoral advisory group dated February 1999 wherein it was recommended that the government champion a new cultural trade covenant , a new international instrument that would lay out the ground rules for cultural policy . 
in addition , this commitment to a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression also is a direct response to recommendation 29 of the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade entitled " Canada and the Future of the World Trade Organization : 
advancing a Millennium Agenda in the Public Interest '' , tabled in the House of Commons in June . 
recommendation 29 specifically calls upon the government to pursue the policy alternative contained in the cultural SAGIT report for a new international instrument on cultural diversity . 
again I applaud the government for its quick response to the report and for the commitment to implement this recommendation . 
all Canadians , every citizen , every government , every business and every community organization , have a part to play . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a lot of time for the hon. member and I appreciate her commitment to the arts. 
it is very heart warming . 
however I would like to know what the member thinks about what the federal government actually does with its so - called investments , that is to say wasteful spending in arts and culture . 
what does the hon. member think of the quarter of a million dollar investment of the minister of heritage in Bubbles Galore ? 
does she think the federal government ' s cultural agenda should include producing pornographic films ? 
what does she think about Hanging the Dead Rabbits ? 
does she think that is an important investment in the cultural future of Canada in the 21 st century ? 
does she think that is necessary to defend our cultural sovereignty ? 
a few years ago , in part through a federal grant , the Vancouver Art Gallery exhibited something called Piss Pope , a picture of the Holy Father submerged in a jar of the artist ' s urine . 
that was another expenditure by the federal government of our tax dollars . 
we could go on and on and on about the kind of absurd , disgusting , wasteful excuse for art which the government finances . 
how does the hon. member apologize for that ? 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte : 
Mr. Speaker , the opposition member has reported some instances of what he calls wasteful expenditure . 
i must say that I see any kind of expenditure in our art and cultural industries as an investment . 
it is an investment in who we are and what we are . 
everyone does not have the same taste but culture and art is a wide - ranging sector . 
it gives us a sense of place and a sense of being , as the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage so eloquently put it . 
i recommend to my hon. colleague that he actually take a look at that report and at the recommendations made by that committee . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there must be many Canadians who voted for the Liberal Party that are feeling pretty embarrassed right now that the member would stand to defend the disgusting display of art or excuse for art that was just talked about by my colleague from Calgary . 
the Liberal member stood to defend spending on that trash that she refers to as art and a good investment . 
she owes Canadians a huge apology for her confirmation that taxpayers dollars were spent on that kind of disgusting culture and art , as she referred to it . 
she probably owes an apology to some of her colleagues that were not very pleased with her response to the member from Calgary . 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to support the government and the Minister of Canadian Heritage on continuing investment in the arts and cultural industries in our country . 
they are not only a vital part of our economic growth but , as I have said time and time again , they are an investment in who we are , what we are , our identity and our cultural sovereignty . 
let us never forget that arts and culture sovereignty is inextricably involved with our economic sovereignty . 
i am proud to be a member of the government and to support its commitment to arts and culture . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to speak to the throne speech today and to be back with colleagues on this side of the House . 
in response to the hon. member who just spoke , it is contrary to what most Canadians believe when she suggests that they should have their tax money forcibly taken from them and given to projects which are completely contrary to their values , the things they believe in . 
some people have very strong religious beliefs , for instance . 
it is completely wrong and I believe most Canadians think it is completely wrong when their tax dollars are forcibly taken to devote to things those people would consider to be blasphemous . 
that is exactly what the Liberal government does , and I cannot believe it sits there and defends it . 
at the beginning of a year most people sit down to make some new year resolutions . 
when they have the resources to do that , that is exactly what they do . 
as the government moves into not only a new year but a new decade , a new century , and a new millennium , I would think it would want to do that too . 
it should want to make a special effort to set about reforming how it does things . 
i would argue , and I think most Canadians would agree with me when I say it , there are many areas where the government is simply not doing a good job . 
it is not doing a good job in providing national defence . 
it is not doing a good job in our justice system . 
there is lots of room for improvement in the delivery of health care and social services . 
it is not doing a good job in ensuring that government is accountable . 
it was a lot of tinkering , and that certainly characterizes this administration . 
when we wipe away all the rhetoric in the 24 page throne speech , what are we left with ? 
we are left with an announcement that the government will make an announcement about tax relief at some point in the future . 
we are also left with a whole slew of tax increases which are coming our way very soon . 
on January 1 we will see a payroll tax hike because Canada pension plan taxes are going up once again . 
we will see small business face a tax increase because their small business exemption will be eroded by inflation . 
they will pay more in taxes . 
it will be the same for the small business capital gains exemption and for farmers and their capital gains exemption . 
that will mean a tax increase for all those people . 
that is the reality . 
all this talk that we hear on the other side about how much the government cares about taxes really does not amount to a whole lot when we look at what it will actually do . 
it will raise taxes . 
the government talks about its plan to cut taxes . 
we will hear about that in the next few days . 
it is to reduce taxes by $ 16.5 billion , but it does not say at the same time that it is raising taxes by over $ 18 billion . 
the net result is that Canadians who now face the highest taxes in Canadian history will face even higher taxes thanks to the finance minister and the Liberal government . 
that is wrong . 
it is wrong for a couple of reasons . 
first and probably most important , it is wrong because it hurts people . 
if the government really were compassionate and wanted to be fair and provide people with options and opportunities , it would have devoted the first 12 pages of the throne speech to explaining how it would deliver tax relief to help hard - pressed Canadians . 
it is unbelievable that we stagger under this tremendous tax burden today where families who earn less than $ 20,000 a year are paying $ 6 billion a year in taxes . 
my friend from Crowfoot told me not long ago about a woman and in fact I saw her income tax return . 
she made $ 11,000 and paid $ 600 in federal income tax . 
that is shameful and that party claims to be compassionate . 
we have raised many examples in this place of people who make extraordinarily low incomes and pay extraordinarily high taxes . 
i could go through some examples but I want to talk for a moment about an example presented to me yesterday by my friend from North Vancouver . 
he gave me a letter from a woman whose husband makes $ 65,000 a year , which is a pretty good salary in most people ' s minds . 
the result is the family has to take one car off the road . 
they simply cannot put aside enough money to help them get through what will be a layoff period for this man . 
it is very disturbing when a person makes $ 65,000 and he can barely make it because of the tax burden imposed by the government . 
i happened to be looking through some documents which were confidential until we received them through access to information a little while ago . 
even the minister ' s own briefing notes acknowledge that Canada has by far the highest tax burden in the entire G - 7 . 
out of all of our trading partners , out of all of the most prosperous nations in the world , we have by far the highest personal income taxes . 
i always find it amazing that in Canada today people pay more in taxes than they spend on food , shelter and clothing combined . 
when we add all of that up , it does not leave much left over . 
when all those taxes are paid and money is spent on the bare necessities of life , there is very little left over . 
that is why we are in a position in Canada today where we have seen disposable incomes mired at 1980 levels . 
for 20 years we have had our disposable incomes mired at that 1980 level . 
there was much airy talk in the throne speech about Internet programs and acting as a big travel agency for young people and sending them around . 
that is really nice but it is not a luxury we can afford today , not when Canadians are staggering under that level of taxation . 
it is ridiculous . 
if the government were really fair , it would acknowledge that it was Canadians who balanced that budget for it . 
does the House realize that the average family today is paying taxes 30 % higher than it was six years ago ? 
that is $ 4,300 , a staggering number . 
it is not the finance minister nor the government that balanced the budget ; it was balanced on the backs of taxpayers . 
fairness decrees that they should now get some tax relief . 
i want to speak just a little bit about the situation on the farm today . 
i come from a farm riding . 
i want to talk about how taxes hurt farmers . 
do hon. members realize that taxes are embedded in just about every input they can think of ? 
fuel taxes take up about 50 % of the price of fuel . 
on fertilizer and chemicals and machinery , taxes take up 15 % , 20 % to 30 % of the price of those things . 
if we could lower taxes we could help people in a direct way on the farm , but we do not see that coming from this government . 
in conclusion , I simply want to say that the fairest way to treat Canadians as we go into the next millennium is to lower their tax burden . 
they will take those resources and use them to help their families and to help children , which is something that the government claims it is concerned about . 
Canadians will use those resources to help their friends and their neighbours and to strengthen their own situation . 
ultimately , I think most Canadians would agree that a dollar left in the hands of the taxpayer will be a lot better utilized than a dollar left in the hands of a politician or a bureaucrat . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague , the Reform Party finance critic , for his excellent presentation in debate today . 
i would like him to centre in on one thing which I think is of a huge concern to Canadian families . 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to address that question from my colleague from Prince George - Bulkley Valley . 
the fact is that Canadians have seen their disposable income stuck at 1980 levels . 
for the things the government claims it cares about most , for instance children , it means that children are put in a terrible position . 
not long ago I received a letter which had been passed on to me by the member for Cariboo - Chilcotin . 
in that letter a young woman explained that because of the EI rate of this government and the fact that people were not getting those employment insurance premiums back , she could not afford to put her young son into hockey . 
that is the sort of thing that happens on a day to day basis across the country . 
it was not very long ago when the leader of the Reform Party brought a family from New Brunswick to Ottawa and explained what the Reform plan of reducing taxes would do for that family . 
about $ 3,000 would go back to that family . 
we actually gave them that money . 
what did they use it on ? 
they also used it to pay back an RRSP that they had to cash in to pay their tax bill . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it has become quite clear that the Liberal Party , the Government of Canada , is using a new code word for its favourite thing to do which is spending , and that word is investment . 
i would like my hon. colleague ' s comments on this word investment . 
could he tell us what that really means in terms of government spending ? 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
it tries to cover it up by calling it investment . 
frankly , it is obscene what it does with some of the money but a lot of it is just serious waste . 
that money could be used for things that the government claims it cares about . 
what is a higher priority , spending money on pornographic films or providing hospital beds ? 
or should it be used to provide tax relief for Canadian families who are struggling ? 
should we be giving grants to big business or should we be using that money to ensure that children in Canada have a proper education ? 
those are the sorts of things that are priorities , not grants to special interest groups , big business and ridiculous campaigns to impose certain cultural values on other Canadians using their tax money . 
it is time the government came clean and simply explained to people that really its intention is not to use that money wisely but to spend it frivolously in too many cases . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted to rise on debate on Her Excellency ' s Speech from the Throne . 
as the member for Parkdale - High Park said in her articulate defence of anti - Catholic government funded pornographic art , this budget was filled with all kinds of marvellous Liberal - style investments . 
it was a return to old fashioned liberalism , namely the arrogance of a tax and spend philosophy which believes that politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa know better how to spend a scarce dollar than do a homemaker , a small business person , an entrepreneur or a taxpayer . 
that is the philosophy of the Speech from the Throne which we heard earlier this week . 
the government devoted a couple of words in the speech to some token talk about tax relief , but it also said that the government has already cut taxes . 
we know we cannot believe the completely specious commitment to tax relief from the government given the fact that it has not yet delivered any tax relief . 
in fact what it has delivered are tax increases . 
it is tax grief for Canada , not tax relief . 
if the government has lowered taxes , then why is it bringing $ 40 billion more into the federal treasury than it was six years ago ? 
while virtually every other G - 7 economy lowered its personal income tax burden over the last 15 years , Canada ' s rose sharply , both as a percentage of GDP and of household income '' . 
but we do not have to quote the experts or look at the stats that the government ignores because we do not have to make this case to Canadians . 
they know when they get their paycheques . 
they know when they look at their pay stubs that they are going home with less than they did in 1993 when this government came into power with a pledge never to raise taxes . 
i remember the Prime Minister saying when he was asked if he would raise taxes , " Well , I can ' t rule it out , there might be a war or something '' . 
well there has been a war . 
it has been a war on Canadian taxpayers and they are paying more than they ever have before . 
that is the ultimate measurement by the international markets of the value of our economy , of our currency and it ultimately reflects the fiscal policy of the government . 
the Liberal government loves to bash the United States . 
the United States has its fair share of problems , but I do not think we should take pride in becoming poorer as they become richer . 
i do not think we should take pride in what the Minister of Industry said last February , that had Canadian productivity , competitiveness and growth kept pace with that of the United States over the past two decades the average family in Canada would be $ 28,000 a year better off . 
that is apparently the moral high ground that the government takes in its posturing and its bashing of an economy which is growing much faster than our own . 
i spent all four weeks of September in nine of the ten provinces and in nearly 30 communities speaking to business people , entrepreneurs , chambers of commerce and small business folks . 
i was on university campuses and in high schools . 
again and again in every region of the country I heard that we have a huge and growing drain of talent and entrepreneurialism out of this country , not just to the United States but to other more competitive , faster growing and lower tax jurisdictions . 
this summer the Conference Board of Canada released a major study wherein it indicated that the number of Canadians who are going to the United States increased from 17,000 in 1986 to over 98,000 in 1997 . 
the government denies it . 
the Liberals put their heads in the sand and say the problem does not exist . 
why then is it that nearly 70 % of our computer science graduates are now leaving this country ? 
these people will be creating untold future wealth and economic opportunity , and contributing to a tax base to finance health care , education and pensions . 
we want these people here , contributing to our tax base so that we can afford to pay down the debt , to grow the economy , to pay for health care and to pay for a civil society . 
we are literally eating away at the productive capacity of our economy . 
i was on a university campus this summer where 120 of the 130 kids who graduated from computer science last year took placements outside Canada because they could not find economic opportunities here . 
the capital was not here to invest and create new cutting edge , information technology businesses and economic opportunities for those kids . 
every one of those kids who has left the country represents the hopes and dreams of Canadian families who believed that if they worked hard , played by the rules , paid their taxes and invested in their children ' s education they would see their children and grandchildren raised happily and in prosperity in Canada . 
what do we have instead ? 
we have thousands and thousands of broken dreams because of the broken economy delivered by this government ' s high tax , high regulatory , high debt , high spending policies . 
that is our top priority . 
we want to relieve those people entirely of their tax obligations , which finance government investments like Bubbles Galore . 
reformers also believe it is critically important that we generate new investment and capital formation to create opportunities for those young people who are leaving today , as well as to cut the insidious tax on wealth creation called the capital gains tax . 
the United States is not going to stop there . 
the chairman of the federal reserve , the leading economic authority in the world today , has called on Congress twice publicly to eliminate the American capital gains taxes , as has been done in Ireland , Hong Kong and so many other jurisdictions . 
how can we believe that we can retain capital in this country to create wealth , jobs and quality of living as long as we have this enormous and growing differential ? 
the finance minister knows perfectly well that if he did not increase spending , as he plans to do , we would see surpluses of about $ 25 billion a year within five years . 
that is not all . 
every jurisdiction in the world that has cut tax rates has seen revenues grow . 
the United States cut its taxes in 1962 and in 1982 , its high marginal rates and capital gains rates . 
in both instances it saw an explosion in revenues from those sources . 
right here at home , of course , Mike Harris and his common sense revolution cut income taxes by 30 % and saw a massive growth in revenues from the income tax . 
the moral of the story is that tax cuts are necessary to grow the economy . 
the government says we have to wait for growth before we can cut taxes . 
we will never get to that kind of real growth if we wait to cut taxes . 
it is time that we got our priorities right . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to compliment the hon. member and the hon. member who spoke before him on their fine presentations . 
what they were stating is intrinsically true . 
those regimes which have low taxes have high growth and the chance to create growth and wealth . 
from 1992 to 1997 taxes have increased 15 % as a percentage of income for Canadian families , to the extent that they now spend more money on personal income taxes than they do on food , clothing or household operations . 
given that fact , if the government really wants to develop a children ' s agenda and it wants to invest in and enhance institutions that invest in the betterment of children , why does it not invest in the institution that has proven to be successful for children , that being the Canadian family ? 
if the government really wants to enhance the welfare of children in the country , why does it not provide the tax relief to Canadian families that they so earnestly deserve ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the hon. member ' s question . 
i can only assume that the answer is that the members of the Liberal government honestly believe , and I grant them that they believe this sincerely in their little red Liberal hearts , that they and their bureaucrats here in Ottawa know better how to spend an extra buck than a taxpayer in Fundy - Royal or Calgary Southeast . 
that is fundamentally what drives the philosophy of this throne speech and this government . 
it is a philosophy which has been abandoned by virtually every other government of the developed world . 
let us take again the case of Ireland . 
it had a subsidy drenched subsistence economy with the highest taxes in Europe , whose only major export was its young people . 
they could have kind of moped along and said " Oh , well , we politicians and bureaucrats are going to keep on subsidizing , raising taxes and intervening in the economy '' , but they had the courage to do something different . 
they took a risk . 
they cut their capital gains taxes . 
what they saw was a massive explosion in that economy , so that now 20 % of the direct investment in Europe is going to a country with only 1 % of Europe ' s population . 
they became the second largest software exporter in the world . 
Ireland ' s population is now growing for the first time in 150 years . 
i cannot hesitate to remind my colleague from Fundy - Royal that , unfortunately , it was his party ' s government which oversaw the largest decrease in after tax disposable income in modern Canadian economic history because of its 72 tax increases , but I will not mention that . 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York North , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted that the member opposite has raised the issue of the Tory tax increases that we all had to suffer through in the 1980 s . 
however , there was a group of Canadians who enjoyed some tax reductions . 
those are some of the wealthiest Canadians in this country . 
as someone who lives in the province of Ontario , I hear all this talk about the united alternative , uniting options on the right and tax cutters for the rich . 
the only thing they are interested in doing is cutting taxes for the rich . 
they do not care about the health and the well - being of families in this country . 
they do not care about the struggles of the lower income classes . 
it is a farce when they talk about cutting taxes . 
what they are really talking about is making more money available for their rich friends , whether their rich friends are in Calgary or in Fundy - Royal . 
i ask the member opposite if indeed he was willing to join in the hands of friendship and ideology with members of the Conservative Party as it slashed the taxes of the rich and made the poor continue to pay ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , this coming from a member whose government takes $ 6 billion a year from people earning under $ 20,000 a year . 
it is a government that gives billions of dollars of subsidies away to its big business friends like Bombardier . 
when I hear the millionaires who populate the front bench of the government talk about concern for the poor , whom they put on the tax rolls and from whom they extract billions of dollars , it is a little bit disingenuous . 
maybe it is time the millionaires on the front bench of the government paid their share . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am absolutely delighted to inform the House that I will be sharing my time with the Ciceronian orator from Mississauga West . 
i am privileged and pleased to stand in my place to speak on behalf of all constituents of the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke to make a reply to that carefully crafted , compassionate , caring 1999 throne speech . 
last night I had the privilege of having the Minister of Finance appear at a function in my riding . 
i might add that he braved rather stormy weather to make it up to the Petawawa Civic Centre . 
when he spoke , and he spoke very eloquently , he thanked the many people of the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , in the upper Ottawa valley , for everything they have done in the last 150 years to make Canada the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
i looked around the room to see some of the people who were participating in this rather auspicious event . 
there were 10 other members of parliament who attended . 
some of them are here in the House as we speak . 
as a matter of fact , some of them were from the opposition . 
i must say , unequivocally , that I agreed with the Minister of Finance that he had definitely hit the nail on the head . 
what the throne speech effectively did was tell the Canadian people that the government has done a great job . 
we hope that it continues to do so as we continue to build the country to greatness . 
i looked around the room and at a table was my 83 year old father , Hector Sr . , who has a grade four education . 
i know the hon. member for Calgary Southeast wanted to talk about people with money . 
i will be the first to admit that my father has money . 
i have nothing . 
i do not even have hair . 
at one time he had two lumber camps on the go with 125 men in each camp . 
he paid his dues . 
he is a good French Canadian Catholic married to an Irish lassie . 
at that same table sat the two aunts of our current finance minister . 
i will not divulge their ages but my father apparently took one of the finance minister ' s aunts out on a date many years ago . 
what is interesting to note is that our finance minister ' s father , the late Paul Martin Sr . , was born and raised in Pembroke . 
he went to school and launched his political career in Pembroke . 
the hon. members opposite can talk about being American wannabes , but what do the Americans cherish most about Canada ? 
they cherish our valued health care system , our medicare . 
Paul Martin Sr . was the genesis who promoted medicare back in the 1950 s and 1960 s . 
sitting at that same table was a man by the name of Roy Geisebreck , whom the finance minister will remember playing hockey with back in the 1950 s and 1960 s in Pembroke and Petawawa . 
the Geisebreck family is not only famous for their hockey playing talents . 
the member opposite spoke rather eloquently about small and medium sized businesses . 
the Geisebreck family has been one of the business mainstays in my riding for well over 70 years . 
there were seven brothers involved in the business started by their late dad , Charlie . 
now Roy Geisebreck , who is 82 , is the patriarch of that remarkable family . 
it is people like Roy Geisebreck and his family who have really built this county through hard work and determination . 
they did not skate around the issue like some of the hon. members from the Reform Party and some of the opposition . 
John Yakabuski was there from Barry ' s Bay . 
his father was a member of the provincial government for over 23 years , the provincial government that Premier Mike Harris currently leads . 
John has seen the light . 
he has seen that I am going to support the Liberal Party . 
he was there last night supporting a well known Liberal in my constituency . 
the hon. member opposite talks about tax cuts . 
they made tax cuts , no question about it , but with borrowed money . 
one should not make tax cuts with borrowed money . 
as a result of making those tax cuts with borrowed money , they had to do some closures . 
in my riding they closed the Civic Hospital in Pembroke , Ontario . 
John Yakabuski , as we speak , is on council in Barry ' s Bay . 
he has also taken over his dad ' s hardware business and is doing a remarkable job . 
again , I say to the member opposite , he is one of these people with a small and medium - sized business who is certainly promoting not only the quality of life for Canadians but also the Canadian culture . 
he was absolutely delighted last night with the throne speech that was brought down by Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson . 
Mr. Speaker , you are well aware of Renfrew , Ontario . 
i believe that you have a cottage up in Renfrew where on occasion you go canoeing and swim . 
you would know Mac Wilson from Renfrew . 
Mac Wilson was at this very auspicious event last night . 
Mac Wilson suffered some health problems about six or seven months ago . 
he was hospitalized in Ottawa because we have great medicare and he took advantage of the medicare system . 
Mac was on his back . 
what did he do ? 
did he give up ? 
no , he fought back . 
he is the industrial commissioner but not only that , as you well know , Mr. Speaker by knowing Mr. Wilson personally , he is one of the great entrepreneurial spirits in Renfrew , Ontario . 
we had big Len Shean there last night . 
he is the mayor of Arnprior . 
Len got up and asked the finance minister what we were going to do about the four - laning of Highway 17 . 
i completely agree with Mr. Shean , the big mayor . 
he said we should have more funding set aside for the four - laning of Highway 17 . 
the finance minister clearly indicated to him that we were looking favourably at it but that basically it was at the disposal of the provincial Conservative government . 
however , we will arm - twist and I am sure that we will get the job done . 
we had Tommy Donohue there from the farming community of Douglas . 
one singular characteristic that is endemic to all of these people I have spoken about , and not only to those people but to many people throughout Canada , is simply that they have taken personal responsibility for their lives . 
they do not want us , nor do we want as a government , to infringe upon their entrepreneurial spirit or their joie de vivre by saying that we are going to tell them what to do . 
these people take personal responsibility for their lives . 
they have the vision . 
they have the values of this party and , I am sure , of every colleague in the House . 
i am absolutely delighted to speak on this the last throne speech for the 20 th century and hopefully , if the voters from the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke see fit , I will be here for the first of many throne speeches delivered from this side of the House I might add , so that we will continue to charge on to greatness for this wonderful country called Canada . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise today in reply to my colleague on the throne speech . 
before I do that , I would just like to congratulate Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson on her appointment to the position of Governor General . 
what my colleague from the other side said is quite interesting . 
i would just like to remind him that he is in a federal parliament not in a provincial legislature talking about provincial issues . 
let me ask the member this question . 
it was quoted today in the paper by the Minister of Industry that a stronger focus is needed on tax cuts . 
it states here that he is wise enough to put on the record that tax reform is an important issue . 
the government is not taking this issue as seriously as its own industry minister . 
i would like the hon. member to comment on that point . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier : 
Mr. Speaker , here we go again . 
when the Reform Party first got elected their mantra for years and years was that we have to reduce the deficit . 
there was really no talk about tax cuts . 
its plan , fresh start , or no start , or behind start , or whatever it was , false start , kick start , clearly said to the Canadian public that we had to eradicate the deficit that was left behind by the Conservative government . 
i might add that probably 98 % of those members - and I just saw a former Liberal , who is in the Reform Party , leave - were probably Conservative supporters before they joined this other party . 
they were responsible for a $ 43 billion annual deficit . 
we eradicated that deficit . 
1155 
we are moving in a comprehensive manner . 
we will give further tax cuts . 
that is clearly in our red book agenda . 
i do not know where he is coming from . 
i might tell the hon. member opposite something which I said to the Civitan Club last week in Cobden , Ontario . 
one person got up and asked me if I liked paying taxes . 
i told him to get on the band wagon . 
i said that I do not like paying taxes but that they are a reality of life . 
if the hon. member opposite does not want to pay taxes he should move to some third world country where there are no taxes . 
however , my friend , there is also nothing else , no schools , no infrastructure , no security , no nothing . 
we will reduce and we have reduced taxes . 
it is egregious , it is polemic , it is downright stupid for the Reform Party to stand and say " cut taxes " when we have already done that . 
all their mantra was to get rid of the deficit and we have done that . 
let me get this straight . 
i hope that answers the hon. member . 
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch â teauguay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the member speak about his family ' s history . 
it was interesting . 
however , after four months of inactivity , I was expecting to hear something about the throne speech . 
the purpose of a throne speech half way through a term of office is not the same as one at the beginning of a term of office . 
right now , there are problems . 
the focus of the member ' s speech could have been very specific . 
i would like the member to take a few moments to talk to us about the constitutional crisis , the fisheries crisis , the health and education crisis , the transportation crisis , the poverty crisis , the EI crisis and the millennium scholarship crisis . 
after four months of inactivity , I think it is time to deal with serious issues and leave family history aside . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very very proud of my family . 
my father was a logger and a farmer , and I am proud of that . 
the hon. member says that the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke is always talking about people . 
but Canada is its people . 
i would tell my friend : " Stay in Canada because you know that this is the greatest country of them all . 
stay calm , my friend . 
you know very well that it is the country of all the people served by all the members of this House of Commons '' . 
i am very surprised that he feels education is not - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member but his time is up . 
the hon. member for Mississauga West . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , congratulations to you on the exalted position you have been returned to . 
how does one follow the oratorical splendour of the previous speaker ? 
he neglected to tell the House that the event he was talking about last evening was his 50 th birthday party . 
we should say happy birthday to our friend from Pembroke . 
we have a few other things in common . 
we are brothers . 
it appears we must be related . 
he talked about his father . 
the interesting thing about my situation is that my dad was a national labour leader . 
i often say that having 10 children , my mother and dad were the only couple I knew who were constantly in labour together . 
i find it interesting , though , returning to the issue at hand , to listen to what clearly amounts to nothing more than a feeding frenzy by the opposition . 
i thought about this place over the break this summer . 
i was shocked this morning , when I got back on my elevator to go upstairs in my apartment building , to see the member for Wild Rose coming down . 
my God , he is in my building and there goes the neighbourhood . 
property values are apparently in serious trouble . 
i will have to look for alternative accommodation . 
infighting occurred . 
expulsions into the back row or oblivion or right out of caucus appeared on the front page of every journal in the country on a regular basis . 
then when Reformers got tired of that they bashed poor Joe Clark . 
it seems that Mr. Clark has rejected their amorous attempts to bring them together in bed . 
all this internal combustion that has been taking place appears to be exploding . 
someone has lit a match under them , I guess , and it appears to be now exploding back into this place in parliament . 
as much as I really want to try to deal with the issues , it would be interesting if the opposition parties could try to do the same thing . 
what they are doing now is just simply , mindlessly , without any kind of proper research other than perhaps the National Post , casting aspersions . 
i talked to Canadians all summer . 
when they watch this stuff they get confused . 
they ask who is right and who they should believe . 
should they believe the Reform Party ? 
we are saying we will cut taxes . 
the Reform Party cannot take yes for an answer . 
Canadians look at it and wonder if they should believe these guys in the opposition or believe the government . 
i heard one thing this morning from the opposition that I agree with . 
unfortunately he then went off into a tirade of nonsensical nonsense , if there is such a thing , a double standard , and he lost a very good point . 
it is the people in Canada who indeed have worked hard , who have re - elected the government because they believed in the platform that we put forward . 
we put our cards on the table . 
we said that we would eliminate that $ 42 billion deficit . 
we said that we would reduce taxes . 
we have done that , regardless of what the opposition continues to say , by some $ 16 billion in the last budget . 
we will reduce taxes again in spite of what members opposite say . 
over 600,000 low income Canadians have been taken off the tax rolls altogether . 
have we done enough ? 
members opposite say we are worse off . 
the United Nations says this is the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
we know that . 
i find it interesting that one can say it is the greatest country in the world in which to live unless one lives here . 
people want to complain . 
i had an experience this summer when I went to Strasbourg , France , to the Council of Europe . 
i listened to the issues that were being debated . 
there were 41 countries from Europe that got together in Strasbourg at the Council of Europe , a 50 year old institution . 
i listened to issues they dealt with . 
they dealt with war , death , destruction of communities , ethnic cleansing and annihilation of entire races of people . 
i am not denigrating or putting down the problems we have in the country . 
some of them are extremely serious but let us take a look around the world . 
this country is a marvellous place . 
perhaps opposition members could at least concede that this country is a marvellous place and that Canadians are not boastful people as our Prime Minister said . 
we are quiet , industrious and hard working as a nation . 
we are known for that throughout the world . 
an hon. member : 
are you quiet ? 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
maybe not all of us are quiet , I would agree , but we are hard working and industrious . 
it cannot possibly be the doom and gloom we hear opposite . 
i give some credit to the member for Wild Rose for raising the very valid issue of the problems on our reserves . 
it puzzles me , when I hear a member from the opposite side talking about supporting the natives on our reserves and improving their quality of life , that they do not support the Nisga ' a treaty . 
that treaty has wide support in British Columbia yet they do not support it . 
i also heard them talk about people on the street . 
if there is one problem that is absolutely visible to people who come to this country from other parts of the world , it is the fact that we have a serious homelessness problem . 
we must do something about it . 
it is mentioned in the throne speech , but let me add that a throne speech is a visionary document . 
the work is yet to be done . 
members opposite know full well that those specifics will appear in a budget in February , a budget for which I am quite sure they already have their negative remarks prepared . 
it will lay it out in detail . 
i do not want to overdramatize the issue but we have seen an explosion in the youth in all of North America . 
it has even occurred in western Canada . 
there is a reason for it and we must address the reason . 
it cannot be fixed overnight . 
there have to be stronger families , stronger opportunities for parental care and supervision , and strong leadership within families . 
it is my view that a throne speech simply sets out the vision for that to occur . 
we want to do all these things and it is difficult to balance everything . 
we believe in tax cuts . 
we absolutely believe in reducing the debt which is a burden for future children of the country . 
it is a top priority . 
we believe in our children and in our youth and that the plan laid out in the throne speech has very strong merits to make us the country of the next millennium . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it hurts me to say this but I would like to compliment my two Liberal colleagues on their speeches . 
i do so because they spoke from the heart . 
while I fundamentally disagree with much of what they say , they have the ability to speak from their hearts rather than from a canned speech handed to them by somebody in the lobby . 
perhaps they could talk to their colleagues and give us a little more entertainment in this place . 
my colleague made a comment about whom people should trust or believe . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the compliments . 
that is probably all I need to say . 
i know what his question was - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
we will go now to the member for Churchill River . 
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the regional diversity of Canada is witnessed by everyone who travels the country , but the agricultural industry and the family farm are in crisis . 
time and time again everyone points to the throne speech and says that the family farm was not discussed . 
perhaps the member could respond at some point in time to the fact that part of our family has fallen into hard times . 
can he speak to this issue at all ? 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , not representing a farming community obviously puts me at some disadvantage , but as national politicians we must address all these issues . 
i thank the member for raising the issue . 
our government must continue to support GRIP . 
we have to find a way to make the family farm stronger . 
that is part of the overall goal . 
one does not exclude one segment of society simply because there may not be a specific reference . 
we are talking about tax cuts . 
i think they will help farmers . 
we are talking about new technology , investing in science , finding new ways to treat crops , new ways to cut costs for farmers and programs that are already in place . 
i agree with the member ' s concern and I am confident the government will help farmers . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a couple of comments . 
forty - eight per cent of the farming community in the areas we have been referring to are up for bankruptcy . 
quality of life is in jeopardy for these people , which is something the member would not know anything about because he thinks milk comes from a carton or that pork is manufactured in some plant . 
i wish the Liberal government could visit reserves to see the squalor that exists . 
the Nisga ' a agreement does not solve that but accountability does . 
when the government came to power in 1993 it announced that one million children were living in poverty and that something had to be done . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not consider child poverty to be a very funny issue at all . 
our government has announced that we have already increased the national child credit and that we are committed to doing more in that area . 
the most important thing we can do for the country is to ensure that all families , all Canadians , have equal access to opportunity ; that children go to school with full bellies in the morning ; and that they have proper supervision and someone to come home to at the end of the day . 
i have raised three boys and I have some understanding of where milk comes from , regardless of the member ' s denigrating remarks . 
we must and we will do something about child poverty . 
it will be action , not words , and not the negativity I hear coming from members opposite . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i would simply like to draw to your attention the fact that my colleague from Beauharnois - Salaberry will be sharing his time with my colleague for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , and that all colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois will be sharing time for the rest of the debate . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take the opportunity of my first speech of the second session of the 36 th legislature to greet the people of Beauharnois - Salaberry and to let them know that I intend to continue to represent them in this House with dignity and to behave in a manner that is fully respectful of Parliament and its members . 
i reiterate my commitment to continue to serve the public within this institution , a service which gives a deep and sincere meaning to my political commitment . 
i would also like to greet my landlady here in the federal capital region , Mrs. Anne Allard , who has honoured me today with her presence in the Opposition gallery . 
i was not much impressed by the Speech from the Throne , and even less impressed by the address in reply given yesterday by the Prime Minister . 
what I find objectionable in these speeches is not so much their ceremonious nature but , rather , their pretentiousness . 
there is something unhealthy about a speech in which the government keeps repeating that Canada is the best country , that it is the envy of the whole world and that others dream of a country like ours . 
the fact is that such pretentiousness cannot hide the insecurity that characterizes this country , that compels it to make an abusive use of its flag and symbols to create an identity that it is sorely lacking . 
such insecurity probably explains why the Prime Minister likes to refer to Canada as a multicultural , postnational society , while trying to present his government as a national government . 
it is not the first such paradox from the Prime Minister . 
this speech is indeed a paradox , given that a supposedly national government is opting for a way which , for Canada , is increasingly less respectful of federalism , an allegedly national government that is delivering , at least as regards Quebec , an increasingly less coherent speech . 
incidentally , is it not strange that , following the Mont - Tremblant conference on federalism and globalization - in which my colleagues and myself were , as can be expected , very pleased to participate - the word " federalism " is nowhere to be found in the throne speech , nor is the term " federation '' , and the adjective " federal " is used only four times ? 
by contrast , the speech refers to national will , national strategy , national program , national child benefit , national action plan on skills and learning , national health system , national accord with the voluntary sector , and so on . 
so , after the great federalist statements made in Mont - Tremblant , here we have the national ambitions in Ottawa . 
national ambitions may seem quite legitimate to Canadians who want the federal government to take on a greater role in the areas of family policy , education , health , or in the voluntary sector . 
as far as Quebecers are concerned , the jurisdiction of the National Assembly and of the Government of Quebec should not be limited by such intrusions and by such ambitions , because these ambitions become intrusions . 
each successive government in Quebec has challenged the federal government ' s right to invade Quebec ' s areas of jurisdiction , by using its exorbitant spending power . 
in this regard , the Speech from the Throne , like the latest budget speech , puts the framework agreement on social union at the centre of its national strategy , an agreement that incorporates the national will of the Liberal government . 
it should no doubt be mentioned that Quebec did not sign the agreement , because the Speech from the Throne does not mention Quebec ' s opposition and treats Quebec ' s objection as empty . 
but what does it matter , the framework agreement on social union , like the Constitution Act , 1982 , before it , which Quebecers objected to and continue to do so , is to structure Canada of tomorrow , to provide it with a national government , to focus on health care , post - secondary education and social services . 
the Bloc Quebecois will defend the interests of Quebecers here in the House of Commons , and will keep on reminding people that the framework agreement on social union , just like the 1982 Constitution , was adopted without the consent of Quebec and cannot be imposed upon it . 
the modest place reserved for national unity , an expression moreover that does not figure in the text of the 1999 throne speech , only thinly disguises how much the Liberal government is troubled by this question . 
the cause of this seems to be the continuing high level of support for sovereignty and the fact that Quebecers are keeping all of their options open as far as their political and constitutional future is concerned . 
moreover , it is aggravated by the fact that the commitment to an in - depth reform of federalism cannot be respected and that no concrete proposal for renewal has been formulated , as is clearly evident in the throne speech and the Prime Minister ' s address in reply , both of which indicate the total absence of a plan A , which we now realize will never see the light of day . 
it also explains the laconic nature of the throne speech , which contains two very general statements , one that suggests Quebecers do not want a third referendum , and another that invents a new principle of clarity . 
as far as this second point is concerned , the Government of Canada , which demands clarity from others , is hiding behind a principle of clarity that the supreme court has not ruled constitutional so as to hide its own intentions . 
it is leaving itself lots of leeway to interfere in Quebec ' s referendum process . 
will it resort to legislation , a motion , or a ministerial statement ? 
when it comes to clarity , we have seen better . 
and here is a clear message to all ministers responsible for clarity , truth , interference and guardianship : they will have to answer to the Bloc Quebecois , which will proclaim loud and clear that Quebec is a sovereign nation and that , when the time comes , it will oppose any plan designed to limit its freedom to choose its own destiny . 
in conclusion , I would like to quote from Jean de La Fontaine , who wrote in one of his fables : 
discussion is what many like . 
opinions in the court abound . 
but calls to action strike great fear . 
supporters then cannot be found . 
today , the government keeps talking about Plan B in an attempt to give it new life . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague ' s speech was very clear and no one asked for any clarification on his excellent analysis of the situation . 
before dealing directly with the throne speech , I want to convey the following message to all farming families in my riding , in Quebec , and even in Canada : the Bloc Quebecois will not let you down . 
the Bloc Quebecois will continue to demand additional resources to fight organized crime efficiently and to eliminate the terror that these families are subjected to year after year by cannabis producers . 
in the weeks or months to come , my colleagues from Berthier - Montcalm and Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert will propose legal measures to step up the fight against organized crime , particularly with regard to cannabis producers . 
we expect the government , which has a great responsibility in this regard , to take measures based on our proposals . 
that being said , I will now deal with the throne speech from a public finance perspective . 
first , I want to correct two major blunders found in the Speech from the Throne , which I am sure are accidental , but which have left a lot of people wondering . 
i am convinced these are mistakes . 
the two big blunders found in various parts of the throne speech are the references to tax reductions and to the government ' s determination to fight poverty . 
there appears to be two analytical and factual errors in the speech . 
i will take the next few minutes to set the record straight . 
first of all , I practically fell off my seat when I saw in the throne speech that the government had reduced taxes by $ 16 billion over three years . 
at this rate , if we are to believe the government , in about ten years ' time , Canadians will not be paying a cent in taxes . 
that is what the Minister of Finance is telling us . 
he talked about the cumulative tax cuts he has supposedly made over the years and added them up . 
if we took this to its logical conclusion , in ten years not a single Canadian would be paying any personal income taxes . 
it is well known that the Minister of Finance eliminates surpluses . 
the truth is that he has continued to cook the books . 
a look at the most recent Department of Finance publication shows that Quebecers and Canadians were paying $ 5.5 billion less in taxes in 1993 - 94 , before the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government took office , than they are today . 
in other words , by means of various hidden taxes , as well as tax tables and a fiscal structure in general that are completely unindexed , the government has increased the tax burden of Quebecers and Canadians by $ 5.5 billion since 1993 - 94 . 
undeniably , there have been tax cuts . 
the last four years have seen a number of such cuts . 
let us look at some examples of just what sort of cuts the Minister of Finance is offering . 
let us take the last budget . 
a significant measure in the last budget was the abolition of the 3 % individual surtax . 
yet when one looks at those who have really been the ones responsible for putting public finances on a sounder footing , that is the middle income earners , those with annual incomes of between $ 30,000 and $ 70,000 , they have saved approximately $ 160 in taxes this year . 
they are the ones who are being strangled by the lack of indexation and by other disguised taxes , and they are never the ones who get any recompense for their efforts . 
yes , there have been tax cuts . 
but cuts for the richest people in this country . 
those who have been most responsible for putting public finances on a sounder footing have been totally forgotten . 
i will offer two figures to illustrate this . 
families earning between $ 30,000 and $ 70,000 in Canada constitute 27 % of Canadian taxpayers . 
they are responsible for about 50 % of personal income taxes that flow into the federal government ' s coffers . 
do you see the imbalance ? 
these people make up a little over one quarter of all taxpayers , but they contribute half of all the taxes paid by individuals to Ottawa . 
it is for that group that the government must do something , not for those earning $ 250,000 or more , which include millionaire friends of the Minister of Finance . 
it is in that category that the government should have taken action , but did not . 
the fact is that , in net terms , Canadian individuals pay $ 5.5 billion more in taxes than they did before the Liberal government came to office , in 1993 . 
the other major blunder to which I referred earlier is the fight against poverty . 
i read on page 7 of the throne speech that the government intends to make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty . 
i believe there is a mistake here . 
i think the analyses were not presented properly and the government will make corrections . 
how can you break the cycle of poverty when you are the one that created it ? 
i can only conclude that excluding the unemployed from the employment insurance program , excluding people who are experiencing hard times because they lost their jobs has resulted in an increase in the number of people living in poverty . 
how can the cycle of poverty be broken when the government is the author of it and is not prepared to change the employment insurance plan . 
in some instances , problems have been deliberately incorporated in the plan . 
let us take , for example , the case of pregnant women , who must stop working because their health and the health of their child are at stake . 
because of the problems in the plan , weeks spent on the Quebec CCST are not included in the calculation of hours and weeks worked in order to be able to enjoy special employment insurance benefits subsequently . 
this is a serious problem . 
women are therefore going to think twice before taking precautionary time off work , thus putting their own health and the health of their child at risk . 
there are a lot of problems in the system . 
and why do all these problems exist ? 
why are most of the unemployed excluded ? 
in order to bring in a surplus of between $ 6 billion and $ 7 billion . 
this is despicable . 
finally , when we look at this government , we realize that it generates poverty . 
in conclusion , in examining this and having seen what the government proposed in the throne speech , we have no choice but to consider this government irresponsible . 
it is much better at making hollow formulae than at correcting inequality and fighting poverty with vigour . 
for all these reasons , we reject this throne speech , which is worth nothing more than the paper it is written on . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
as a member of the government side of the House and as a Canadian , I must say how proud I was of our Prime Minister yesterday . 
he gave a tremendous speech and allowed us to contemplate Canada today in the context of our past . 
the Prime Minister reminded us that we did not discover this land , that first nations and Inuit people were here first and welcomed newcomers so many years ago . 
he reminded us of our French heritage , of our British heritage . 
the Prime Minister allowed us to contemplate the fact that out of a need to downplay nationalistic tendencies , we now are a country that values quiet confidence and modesty . 
out of a need to share wealth , we in Canada now value the sharing of wealth and generosity not only between and among citizens and between and among regions of this great country , but between Canada and other countries around the world . 
we know that Canada out of a need to respect individual citizens and respect the importance of each one of us as Canadians is now a country that absolutely respects and values human rights and freedoms . 
out of the need to govern with compassion over the turbulent but wonderful history we call ours , we are now a country that values governance with compassion , governance with tolerance , governance with generosity . 
we indeed know that our country is a wonderful and unique federation . 
to many , Canada is an experiment , but to us , Canada is a logical , practical and principled society and we are always pushing at the edges of what we know to be civilization . 
i am convinced that as we move into the 21 st century we will continue to do that . 
but if we look at the nineties , our options to continue to improve this great country in which we live were limited . 
the decade of the nineties was a time of turbulence , of difficulties for citizens and for our country . 
we know that unemployment rates were extraordinarily high . 
we know that we were under very significant fiscal constraints . 
but with the leadership of our Prime Minister and with the extraordinary will of the Canadian people we are now back in a stable form . 
unemployment is at its lowest level in nine years at 7.5 % . 
there is an increasing respect and confidence in Canadian institutions . 
we know that we live in a great federation and we are continuing to appreciate that and to build on that . 
we got our fiscal house in order . 
we are governing in a balanced way . 
we are attacking our debt . 
as Liberals we have always said that we were not interested in making cuts for the sake of making cuts . 
getting our fiscal house in order was a challenge we set for ourselves so that we would allow ourselves the choices to continue to improve and build on our great federation . 
on the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister identified in his speech yesterday a number of areas that we set out as our priorities as we move into the 21 st century . 
we want to continue to build our strong federation . 
i would like elaborate on a couple of those aspects in my speech today . 
first , Canadians now know that the government has put a priority and a focus on our children . 
as we reflect on the work of our country in the past decades , we know that we have found ways to support Canadian seniors with programs like the old age security , guaranteed income supplement and our partnership with the provinces with the Canada pension plan . 
those are programs that Canadians know and appreciate and which seniors access . 
those programs have allowed us to significantly reduce poverty among Canadian seniors . 
we have programs in place to support working age Canadians , such as employment insurance and the provinces have income support . 
those programs are there . 
Canadians are familiar with them and use them if they have to . 
we have encouraged and supported our young people in finding that very important first job . 
we have encouraged them to continue with post - secondary education . 
we are finding ways as a country to support our youth . 
in the Speech from the Throne we identified continuing ways to support Canada ' s youth by ensuring that they have the opportunity to travel this great nation through exchanges to get to know each other . 
that is critically important in a country as large as ours . 
we know that at earlier ages young people are able to contribute and the notion of celebrating their first works is an important priority for our government . 
there is no question that remains paramount . 
it is parents who have the responsibility and the ability to raise healthy children . 
but times are changing . 
it is very expensive to raise children . 
yes , it is appropriate that we make tax cuts in support of families . 
the Reform Party would see that as being the only support we can provide to our children , but we know there is much more that is needed . 
research is telling us that the very early years of a child ' s life , zero to six , are critical . 
that research is now becoming more and more available to us . 
in the Speech from the Throne we have been directed to work together as governments , the Government of Canada with the provinces and territories , to explore this research , to understand it and to build some common values and principles as to how we can support parents and children through those very early times . 
that work has already begun . 
we have sat at the table with the provinces and territories . 
we have built a document , the national children ' s agenda , which is now being discussed in workshops around Canada . 
we will look for input from Canadians on that to assess the values and principles that should guide us as we build a stronger partnership with Canadian citizens , parents and children to support early childhood development . 
we intend to have that work completed and to present it to Canadians by December 2000 . 
there is more . 
we know there is a direct relationship between children at risk and the income of their families . 
provinces have supported families through income support measures and services for children . 
we know that the most important thing we can do is to find ways and means for all Canadians to have a job . 
that is the biggest thing we can do . 
when parents , men and women , move from welfare into a job , very often that job may be low paying . 
it is difficult for parents to contemplate leaving welfare , where services may also be part of their support for their children , to take a low paying job . 
we are changing that through the national child benefit . 
in this system the federal government provides money to families with children for income whether they are on income support or in low wage positions . 
the savings that the provinces gleaned from that additional money coming from the federal government are being reinvested in services for Canadian children , services that are available to them whether they are supported by families on income support or in low income jobs . 
we are making progress . 
these are the kinds of approaches that show a flexible relationship between the Government of Canada and the provinces is working . 
we know it to be a good platform and we want to build on that . 
in the Speech from the Throne we identified that we would make a significant additional investment in the national child benefit by July 2002 . 
of course everyone heard the Prime Minister yesterday . 
he identified this as being a priority and he has moved that date up to July 2001 . 
there is another aspect to this that is tremendously important . 
we are starting to really understand the changing relationship between the workplace and the family . 
seventy per cent of Canadian families are dual income families , mom and dad both working . 
of course that is changing the relationship between what they are able to do as parents in support of their children . 
that is where we step back and ask , recognizing that those early years are so important , is there not something more that we can do to help parents spend more time with their children and their infants in those very early years ? 
we have identified that indeed there is . 
the Prime Minister said that we would double the benefit , make it more flexible and more accessible . 
in terms of flexibility , we also appreciate that there are adoptive parents and that they too need to be home with their children in those early years . 
in terms of accessibility , we will know that we have made changes to the employment insurance program . 
wisely , we have put in place a monitoring and assessment system so that every year we receive information about how that system is working . 
i am looking forward to receiving this year ' s monitoring and assessment report to contemplate that trend , to see if indeed we have to do something to ensure there is accessibility . 
as the Prime Minister indicated , we want to ensure that there is accessibility to this incredible and significant new plan that was announced yesterday . 
with all this and a focus on children we are recognizing that it is wise for us to invest in the early years . 
if we focus on our children the dividends will be huge . 
out of a need to invest in our children I am convinced that we will come to value children as our most valuable resource . 
in the context of valuing people , let us turn to another aspect of the Speech from the Throne . 
the challenge for us as a country is to ensure that our citizens have the ability to participate in the knowledge based economy , to be able to continue to develop and benefit from a vastly and rapidly changing economy . 
we will do that . 
first and foremost we have to ensure that we build a tradition of lifelong learning in Canada . 
in the Speech from the Throne we identified that that will be a priority for us , to work with our partners , with the private sector and with the provinces to do what we can to make sure that from our very early years right through to our senior years we value and engage in lifelong learning . 
that means improving literacy , without question . 
we have a dynamic partnership with the provinces right across this country in focusing on upgrading the literacy of our citizens . 
we have also built strong partnerships with the provinces in the area of labour market development . 
the provinces now have active measures within the agreements that we have written with most provinces and they are using them to facilitate and stimulate the capacity development of their citizens so they can participate in the new Canadian economy . 
we need to do more . 
we need to appreciate that our economy is not a single economy , but is sectoral . 
there are different aspects and sectors to the diverse Canadian economy . 
we need to partner more effectively with the private sector and with unions to understand that , to encourage them to look at their industries , to look at the timeframes , to help smooth out the peaks and valleys , to identify their workforce requirements . 
we can do a better job in this regard . 
in fact , by doing so , instead of following the trends in the economy , we can lead the trends in the economy . 
another thing that is tremendously important is making sure that Canadians have the information they need to make decisions about employment opportunities and business opportunities . 
there was a recent forum for labour market ministers , attended by all provinces and territories , including Quebec , to talk about this . 
we agreed that it is wise for us to work together to create a platform of information that can be used locally at the community level , at the provincial level , at the national level and at the international level so that Canadians have the information they need to make the appropriate decisions for their lives and the lives of their families . 
without question , we have to reach out and engage others at the very beginning of the development of policies . 
we have to work with the private sector and with the voluntary sector . 
we cannot abrogate our responsibility to lead and to make important decisions , but we can find a modern way , a 21 st century way , of building sustainable policies and programs that speak to all Canadians . 
this is a fundamental issue . 
these are the challenges that we have set for ourselves . 
they are a reflection of our belief that we live in a wonderful country , that we have built a flexible federation , that we have something to work for , something to be proud of and something to build upon . 
the Speech from the Throne , as it was presented , gives us all these opportunities . 
i , as a member of this side of the House and a great team , am committed to doing what I can to continue to build a great Canada , to build a Canada which is where people want to be in the 21 st century , to build a Canada that we know will continue to be the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , having known this minister now for quite some time I realize that there is a lot of care and a lot of compassion in her heart . 
i can understand that . 
we have talked a lot over the years about the squalid conditions on reserves , the poverty that exists . 
the conditions , by the way , are not getting any better ; they are getting worse in many cases . 
i have continued to visit these reserves on a regular basis , right up until the time we returned to the House this month . 
it has also been brought to my attention that in 1993 members of the House said that we had to do something about the one million children living in poverty . 
it was also reported this morning that for every one million children who go to school , 166,000 of them go hungry . 
these are the problems that exist . 
they are worse today than they were in 1993 when the government took office . 
what has the government in mind to deal with these problems ? 
programs designed for the year 2001 are not going to make a lot of people happy . 
what is it going to do tomorrow to alleviate these problems ? 
what measures is it going to take to eliminate these serious problems ? 
where is the action ? 
i want to see it . 
hon. Jane Stewart : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the question . 
indeed , the issue of child poverty is an issue that the government takes very seriously . 
that is why we have already invested $ 1.7 billion extra per year in the national child benefit . 
it is that benefit that goes to children in low income families . 
it is that benefit that allows provinces to reinvest their savings in services for these children in the kinds of projects that the hon. member references , food , child support and all those sorts of things . 
that is why , recognizing this as being a priority , in the Speech from the Throne it was announced that we are going to invest another significant amount in the child benefit . 
despite all this , I bet that side of the House will vote against these measures . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a few weeks ago , the minister said that , in Canada , the rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer . 
this was what she told La Presse about two weeks ago . 
we were looking forward to some sort of corrective action in the throne speech . 
today , 40 % of elderly women living on their own are living below the poverty level . 
our old age pension system leaves 40 % of elderly women living below the poverty level , and the throne speech offered no solution . 
then there is EI , for which 40 % of unemployed workers qualify . 
today , all Canada ' s resource regions are facing terrible situations . 
we argued for a full year against the intensity rule for seasonal workers , among others . 
in resource regions , 80 % of workers are affected by this rule . 
i would have expected the new Minister of Human Resources Development to have won out over her more hardhearted Cabinet colleagues , but it seems not . 
that is true , but one must have a decent income . 
here in Canada we have the same situation developing , because we wanted to have an employment insurance system similar to the Americans ' . 
more and more people have work , the unemployment rate is dropping , but the bottom line is that overall family incomes have dropped . 
this is not an incentive to work , but a disincentive . 
it tells people " Even if you work , you will not qualify , or if you do qualify , we will not give you enough weeks of benefits '' . 
i will conclude with the matter of parental leave . 
if I have understood the minister correctly , she is going to wait for the third year report evaluating the employment insurance program before deciding whether she is going to make eligibility conditions easier for women . 
if she does indeed wait for the third year , I have just realized why the program would come into effect only in 2001 . 
there was also a 7 % drop in the amount paid out . 
cannot the minister commit today to stating that the rules for eligibility , which have nothing to do with extending the length of parental leave , could very easily take effect now ? 
hon. Jane Stewart : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member looks at the Speech from the Throne and the commitments of the Prime Minister to double parental benefits , he will see that significant changes to the employment insurance system have been announced . 
everything that he speaks about suggests that he will indeed support us in terms of the Speech from the Throne and the measures we introduced . 
as the economy has changed and increased , one thing that has become clear is that poverty has been stopped this time around . 
usually as the economy increases poverty returns . 
it ebbs . 
we must remember that governments have a role to play in supporting their citizens and in developing programs and policies that do not create have and have nots . 
if he looks at the items itemized in the Speech from the Throne and listened to the speech of the Prime Minister yesterday and the speeches from this side of the House over the course of this debate , the hon. member will see that we understand the role we must play in ensuring that we do not create have and have nots in Canada . 
one of the best ways of doing it is to focus on our children , and we are committed to doing that . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think all of us here want the federation to work , we want the sharing of powers between the provinces and the federal government to work properly . 
the problem is that everyone wants to be excessively visible . 
for instance , there is currently no issue more serious than health in our country . 
i want to ask the minister if she thinks - after cutting $ 17 billion in the social transfers to the provinces for health , education and help for the poor - that the government can do its utmost to ensure that people can get medical treatment in our country . 
especially in Quebec , there are very serious problems in the hospitals ' emergency services and some people have no choice but to get medical treatment outside Canada . 
in addition to the internal problems that we are faced with because of a lack of funding , the cuts made to transfer payments have been drastic . 
this is true for every sector , but I am asking the minister if there is any hope for the health sector . 
hon. Jane Stewart : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is specifically asking the Government of Canada to focus on the issue of health care . 
i remind him that indeed we have . 
some $ 11.5 billion were announced in the last budget to continue to support delivery of health services by the provinces . 
that is the kind of partnership we in Canada believe in . 
that is the kind of flexible federation we know works and that is the approach we are committed to continuing . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by announcing that I will be splitting my 20 minutes with the hon. member for Vancouver East . 
in the limited time I have available I would like to make a few comments on the Speech from the Throne and the state we find the government in . 
one thinks of the metaphor of a deer caught in the headlights . 
there is a long list of things for which the government stands condemned for a failure to act in a timely fashion , or in many cases a failure to act at all . 
the first one that comes to mind is the crisis in agriculture in the country and the fact that producers in Saskatchewan , Manitoba and many other places are facing an income crisis the like of which they have never experienced before . 
the government stands condemned in terms of its inaction with respect to agriculture . 
we hear the Prime Minister say it is a private matter . 
i cannot imagine that even 10 years ago , and particularly 15 or 20 years ago , the Prime Minister of Canada would have said that the future of the Canadian airline industry - Air Canada , Canadian Airlines and the structure of the Canadian air transportation system - was a private matter . 
yet that is the kind of thing the Prime Minister has said . 
we have a government that has stood idly by without taking the kind of action which might ensure that not only jobs and consumers are protected but that Canadian control is protected and we do not end up in a situation in the country like we now have with the railways where basically we are owned and controlled by American shareholders . 
on water exports , we have various provincial projects going ahead . 
the Gisborne Lake project in Newfoundland has received tentative forms of approval . 
instead of acting on a motion passed by the House of Commons back in February which called for a national ban on the export of bulk water , we have nothing except the ball being thrown back and forth between various provincial capitals and this government . 
there has been no action yet to ban bulk water exports and no promise of such legislation in the throne speech , not a mention of it . 
when it comes to the fishery on the east coast and the judgment of the supreme court with respect to the treaty rights of aboriginal people in that area , we have a government which appears to have been totally unable to have anticipated what that judgment might be or to have anticipated difference scenarios so that if the judgment came down in favour of treaty rights , as did happen , then it would have some plan in place . 
this is just elementary . 
yet it is almost as if the Liberals were caught completely by surprise and almost as if they did not even know the supreme court was considering it . 
this has been complicated . 
it arose in the first place because of an unwillingness on the part of the government to act on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples which said that these things should be negotiated and not left to the courts . 
were they negotiated ? 
was there action taken ? 
nothing . 
now we have an horrendous crisis on the east coast as a result of that inaction . 
on homelessness , winter is coming . 
perhaps the Liberals do not know this . 
perhaps so many of them go on winter holidays that they do not know that winter is coming and it gets cold in Canada . 
we have thousands , perhaps tens of thousands of people who are homeless . 
yet did we see any commitment to real money and real action in the throne speech with respect to homelessness ? 
we have a minister of housing but we do not have a minister who is willing to do anything about homelessness , or about housing for that matter . 
we have the crisis in the west coast with respect to the abuse of our refugee system and all the questions that raises . 
No. I do not know what the government is waiting for , and no one else seems to know . 
we have had for a long time now promises of legislation to deal with new reproductive technologies and all the tremendous choices , options and I would say potential evils and dangers that lurk in that array of technologies . 
silence . 
it will not be . 
we have to address these issues and more . 
ten years will have passed . 
will child poverty have been dealt with ? 
the list goes on and on . 
people know as a result of court decisions that our child pornography laws are inadequate . 
we can have a debate about how we should respond to that , whether we should use the notwithstanding clause , appeal the decision or whether we should bring the law back to parliament and write a better law if the law is inadequate . 
let us write a law that deals with that situation . 
do we have such a law before us ? 
do we have even the promise of such a law before us ? 
not a hint , not a sniff of action on any of these fronts . 
it is worth asking why there is this powerlessness , this impotence and this complete silence with respect to so many issues . 
if we look we will see that the underlying reality of all this is the way in which over the past 10 or 15 years , sometimes for good and well intentioned reasons and other times for less well intentioned reasons , this place , both parliament and government , has abdicated its responsibility in many ways to first the marketplace and in some other ways to the courts . 
the government reflects the powerlessness it has chosen by repeatedly signing agreements or adopting policies that make it incapable of dealing with a lot of the situations that we have before us . 
why in part do we have the crisis in agriculture ? 
because this government and governments before it have deliberately stripped the Canadian farmer of all the support systems that used to exist . 
why ? 
because we wanted to be the international Boy Scouts of the marketplace , with all due respect to the Boy Scouts because they sometimes get maligned by being associated with the government . 
the fact is the government has stripped Canadian farmers of the support systems they used to have . 
this started with the elimination of the Crow rate and went right on down . 
then they say there is a crisis in agriculture . 
no wonder . 
other countries have not left their producers abandoned to the marketplace in the way our country has . 
on airlines , what we have before us is the result of deregulation and privatization . 
i can remember when deregulation and privatization first came in . 
oh what a wonderful world it was to be with competition , healthy Canadian airlines competing with each other . 
it was to be a capitalist Nirvana . 
at that time we said that what is happening today would happen . 
we are sorry to be right but the fact is that we were right . 
what we predicted at that time is now happening . 
now we see a government so addicted to the bromides of the marketplace , to the idea that this is a private matter and who would want to interfere in the marketplace , that we stand on the brink of having our airline industry completely taken over by American interests . 
the list goes on . 
we cannot deal with water exports because of NAFTA . 
we cannot deal with poverty or homelessness because that would involve interfering in the marketplace . 
what do we have to do for homeless people ? 
build them houses , for God ' s sake . 
that is what they need , but there is no market for the kind of houses poor people can afford . 
we would have to do that with government money . 
we would have to do that outside the marketplace . 
what a heinous thing . 
what a blasphemous thing that would be because that is outside the political conversation now . 
they want the government to do something . 
if that means getting out of agreements , intervening in the marketplace and acting like governments used to act , then it is high time it did that . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have had the privilege of listening to the member for Winnipeg - Transcona for a number of years . 
philosophically there are a number of issues we are compatible on , but he was not putting out factually correct information on four specific issues related to my community in downtown Toronto . 
the first point is on the issue of homelessness . 
city councillor Jack Layton is having a heyday capitalizing on those 500 to 700 people who are living on the streets of Toronto which none of us like to see . 
the reality is that the issue is affordable shelter . 
yesterday the Prime Minister spoke very specifically about an infrastructure program . 
i think the member and I know the people of my community will be quite satisfied in the very near future as the whole issue of affordable shelter will be central to the infrastructure plan which is unfolding . 
the second issue is that of banning exports of water . 
the Minister of the Environment even before we had recessed for the summer break took very specific measures in the announcement banning exports of water . 
that is something the member obviously missed . 
another issue relates to the children ' s legacy . 
i do not think anyone in the House would deny the fact that the Prime Minister ' s remarks in the House last night went a long way toward moving the commitment to children forward . 
i think it is important that the member when he is criticizing also acknowledge some of the very specific initiatives that were taken . 
finally on the Onex deal where I have very strong views myself , we had assurances yesterday from the Minister of Transport , which I am sure the member read in the paper , that on the issue of air transportation in this country we will have a full and vigorous debate in the House . 
every member will have an opportunity to put his or her views forward and will be accountable . 
it is important when we are having this debate that we at least acknowledge those areas where the government has acted immediately . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , the member says the Prime Minister talked about affordable shelter . 
big deal . 
the government has been talking about affordable shelter for years now . 
we want to see affordable shelters , real objective things that people can live in and people can find shelter in . 
we do not want more fancy speeches from the member , the Prime Minister or anyone else when it comes to homelessness . 
we want real action . 
my complaint is that there has been no real action . 
no one else in the whole country is aware that there has been a national ban on bulk water exports except the hon. member for Broadview - Greenwood . 
to suggest that there has been flies in the face of reality . 
talk to Premier Tobin in Newfoundland . 
ask him if there has been a national ban on bulk water exports . 
he is calling for the federal government to either institute one or give him the freedom to act provincially , one way or the other . 
with respect to the children ' s legacy , I am not sure what the hon. member was talking about but the fact is that when it comes to child poverty , it is a lot worse . 
when it comes to the wonderful , tremendous increase in maternity benefits that the minister for human resources was bragging about not so long ago , it is not going to happen until January 1 , 2001 . 
good luck if a woman is pregnant now or is going to get pregnant in the next year . 
it does not increase her eligibility . 
all kinds of women who may be expecting between now and then still , even if they get pregnant in 2002 , will not be eligible because the eligibility will not have changed . 
with respect to Onex , we are going to have a vigorous debate and then we will get screwed . 
i have seen enough vigorous debates around here to know that they are meaningless unless there are real options on the table and a real commitment by the government because in the end the government will get its way . 
it will have the sham of a vigorous debate . 
it might even let a few Liberal backbenchers stand up and say they do not like what is going on to help the Liberals get re - elected in places like Winnipeg . 
Winnipeg is one of the places that stands to really get it in the ear if this thing goes through . 
we will have a nice vigorous debate and then we will have our airline industry taken over by the United States . 
some comfort . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am almost loath to interrupt the wonderful , enlightened flow of consciousness from the member for Winnipeg - Transcona . 
he has really hit the nail on the head in addressing the issues in the throne speech that concern us . 
i am very happy he has agreed to share his time with me so I can provide some feedback from my perspective and the perspective of our party with regard to the throne speech . 
i listened earlier to the new Minister of Human Resources Development . 
we hope to see some significant improvements to EI and the national children ' s agenda . 
hearing the minister ' s comments about living in a wonderful country with such tolerance and compassion conjures up the image of Liberals looking up at the blue sky with the clouds rolling by . 
many times we have heard the Prime Minister say how proud he is that Canada has been rated by the United Nations as the number one country in the world in which to live . 
but let it also be said that the same United Nations has condemned Canada for its failure to live up to international covenants , for its failure to deal with homelessness , to deal with equity and equality , to deal with the growing gap between people who are getting wealthier and people who are getting poorer . 
when I listened to the throne speech I wanted to hear on behalf of my constituents some clear realistic objectives and commitments that would see a government prepared to bring in a national children ' s agenda , to bring in program and income supports that would reverse this downward spiral , this race to the bottom that we are in . 
apparently the government does not care about this . 
i was disappointed by what I heard . 
i have received feedback from people in my riding , people who are really hard pressed , parents who are working at more than one job , part time jobs , struggling to find child care with their kids on waiting lists . 
these people are being threatened because their housing is going to be demolished or 30 % , 40 % , 50 % or in some cases 60 % of their income is going toward rent . 
these are the families I deal with . 
i know that not just in East Vancouver but in other communities hundreds of thousands of Canadians are facing this reality . 
i listened to the Leader of the Opposition and his response to the throne speech and his view of Canada . 
he has such a narrow definition of what a family is or what a family needs . 
i heard the Leader of the Opposition with his anti - government message that if we just put a few pennies in our pockets through a tax saving , somehow we will have solutions . 
we can see that the Reform Party is bankrupt in its ideas in terms of addressing the substantive issues in our society . 
when we look at the messages in the throne speech and the unfolding of the so - called national children ' s agenda we have to question why a national children ' s agenda exists but there is no child care program . 
why does a national children ' s agenda exist but there is no commitment that the poorest of the poor will have the benefit of the national child tax benefit ? 
why do we have a national children ' s agenda that supposedly speaks to the well - being of early childhood development and the well - being of Canadian families but it does not contain any substance to develop affordable housing , the most basic human right for all Canadian families and all people ? 
we have to be very clear . 
we cannot accept that a children ' s agenda will exist without a national child care strategy . 
for decades numerous groups in this country have advocated for the adoption of an early childhood development program , a national child care program . 
when we compare the government ' s commitments today with what was in the red book in 1993 , it seems to me that we are moving further and further away from any kind of program the government is committed to , to actually make child care a reality . 
in 1993 the Liberal Party promised 150,000 child care spaces . 
where are they ? 
six years have gone by . 
where are those child care spaces ? 
why are there tens of thousands of kids on waiting lists to get into child care ? 
less than 10 % of kids who need child care have access to the regulated spaces . 
the Liberal government has failed on that score . 
its national children ' s agenda is not worth anything more than the paper it is written on unless there is a substantive financial commitment by the government to work with the provinces to produce those child care spaces . 
i will touch on the issue of housing and homelessness . 
it is ironic that in the throne speech more time was devoted to the issue of endangered species than there was to the issue of people who are dying on our streets because of homelessness , or people who are living in totally inadequate housing . 
it is simply appalling that we have had a minister responsible for homelessness who has yet to produce a single unit of housing . 
it is appalling that in the throne speech there was not one specific commitment to say that the federal government will produce a national housing strategy . 
where is that commitment from the other side of the House ? 
where are the specifics ? 
where are the housing units that need to be developed ? 
when it comes to other members of society like students , again in the throne speech we heard platitudes and very lofty ideas about access to the Internet and the knowledge based economy . 
but what about the students who are trying to get through school ? 
what about the students who are suffering from a massive debt load ? 
has the Liberal government addressed that issue ? 
not one line in the throne speech has shown any understanding of the very harsh realities facing students who are trying to get through school . 
we were hoping to see a commitment to a national grants program , to a tuition freeze and to a recognition that post - secondary education should be accessible to all young people . 
that would be a real commitment to building our future , but instead we saw again the lofty ideas and the clouds passing by in the sky in terms of the Liberals ' ideas of what the future is . 
yes , we have had some announcement about parental leave but what about the eligibility requirements ? 
what are parents meant to do after that one year of leave ? 
where will the child care spaces be so that they can return to work ? 
after examining the throne speech and seeing exactly what is and is not there , then I would agree with my colleague for Winnipeg - Transcona that it is empty and vacuous . 
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , some 33 years ago I was a newcomer to this country . 
when I was growing up in Croatia I was poor . 
i came from a large family . 
i know what poverty is . 
listening to the speech today by the hon. member for Vancouver East I am a little confused . 
that is where poverty is , not in Canada . 
i am really surprised to hear the bashing of the Liberal government that it does not care about children and youth in Canada . 
i have four children . 
i did not expect any level of government to take care of them . 
i did not ask the government to provide me with early childhood benefits or whatnot . 
i had children with my wife because we wanted a family . 
we were and still are responsible parents . 
no one can deny that there are children who deserve and need support from governments . 
however , it is not at the level that the hon. member for Vancouver East was saying . 
the hon. member should not portray Canada as the worst place to live when she knows , as well as many of us in the House , that there are millions of people who would rather live here than in their own country . 
in the future , could the hon. member go across the country and see for herself how great the country really is ? 
Ms. Libby Davies : 
Mr. Speaker , I guess it is a matter of perspective of where we live and what our daily reality is as to whether or not this is a wonderful country . 
do not take it from me . 
i encourage the hon. member to read reports from organizations appointed by the government , such as the National Council on Welfare and the reports from the United Nations that have clearly condemned the Canadian government for its failure to address the abysmal conditions that aboriginal people live in . 
i have gone to reserves . 
i have gone to Metis communities . 
i have seen houses where people had no running water or no toilet . 
i do not think those people believe that they live in a wonderful country . 
they would like to have the same opportunities that maybe the member has had . 
when he says he did not expect the government to care for his children , I do not think any parent expects the government to care for his or her children . 
what Canadian families want to see are the kinds of community supports , programs and services , such as an early childhood development program and a national child care program , that will assist families in coping in what is increasingly a very difficult environment . 
i am frankly surprised to hear the member suggest that somehow we should not being doing that . 
to deny the reality that there are millions of Canadians who live below the poverty line , as described by Stats Canada , is simply to not deal with the truth of what goes on in our country . 
yes , there are people who are doing incredibly well and do not need any help whatsoever . 
however , there are very major issues of income distribution and of how wealth is distributed . 
if the member wants , I will take him to my riding and show him what happens when we leave people at the bottom , when we leave society to market forces and when the Liberal Party listens to the business elites and not to the real crowds . 
i will show him the evidence and the consequences of what that means on the streets . 
there are people without shelter and without adequate support . 
there are kids who are going hungry in school . 
the evidence is there and it is in every community in the country . 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Halton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to rise to address the throne speech and review briefly the six years of effort that have been put in by the government to bring our economy and the state of the country to where they are right now . 
i was particularly moved by the words of the hon. member for Cambridge who speaks from his heart about Canada and who , because of his life experience , is able to compare Canada with his country of origin . 
that says more about Canada today than any of the most eloquent speeches that could be made in the House . 
i was very interested that the Leader of Her Majesty ' s Loyal Opposition went on television after the throne speech and suggested that there were no specifics in the throne speech and therefore it was not acceptable . 
they are always speeches of vision . 
the specifics come afterward . 
the Prime Minister , in his response to the Speech from the Throne yesterday , began to put the specifics in place , but it was only the beginning . 
the next stage will be when the official budget comes out and that is due process . 
i hope that the hon. Leader of the Opposition over time and after gaining experience will realize that there are stages we go through . 
it has been six years that I have had the honour of serving in the House . 
we have now entered our third year of surplus budgeting and the deficit has been eliminated . 
that did not happen by accident or by magic . 
it happened with a very concerted effort and with the co - operation of Canadians from coast to coast . 
through the wisdom of our Minister of Finance , it also happened probably in the least painful way it could have . 
i must digress for a minute , Mr. Speaker , to advise you that I beg to share my time with the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra . 
i regret that I forgot to do so at the beginning of my speech . 
it is six years later and where are we today ? 
as the Prime Minister said , it is the first time in 50 years I believe that we have sustained a balanced budget or a budget that contains some surplus . 
we have been able to begin work on paying down the debt . 
we have made a commitment to never again allow the finances of the country to get into the state they were when we inherited them six years ago . 
personally , it has been a very challenging and satisfying time for me and I have been honoured to be here over this period . 
now we are in a new phase . 
it has been suggested that it is more difficult to govern with a surplus than it is with a deficit because once a surplus is seen then the demands come on to do certain things . 
we have made a choice on this side of the House which is to share the surplus by increasing the financial strength of the country and , at the same time , restoring those social efforts that have been a hallmark of Canada over the years . 
we will continue in that direction . 
it will not be sudden , but it will be measured and it will be responsible . 
tax reduction will be part of the strategy because it will put more money into consumers ' pockets . 
debt reduction will be part of the strategy because that allows for more tax reduction . 
the maintenance of a strong economy is essential if we are to move ahead with the restoration of those things which are very important to us , such as health care which is at the top of the agenda at the moment in people ' s minds in this country , and rightly so . 
with all of its warts and all of its weaknesses , it is still the best system . 
if we compare it first to the American system and see 40 million souls , greater than the whole population of Canada , without health care , or when we talk to some U.S. doctors , which I have had the pleasure of doing , and find out what it costs them to operate their health care system , we realize that we have never had it so good and that Canada has got something here . 
yes , it may be flawed , yes , it may be incomplete and yes , it needs improving , but it is there . 
i would remind those who would destroy our health care system of a very personal story about my mother who contracted pneumonia in 1941 and spent 14 weeks in the hospital , in the days before antibiotics I might add . 
my father spent the rest of his life paying off that debt . 
i suppose that is why I am considered to the right of centre in the Liberal caucus to a certain extent . 
however , I must tell the House that the health care system is paramount in the country . 
if we lost everything else , the health care system is a system we must maintain and continually improve . 
where are we going in the future ? 
we have an economy that is sustaining a surplus budget . 
we have a bottom line that is stronger than it has been in many years which has enabled us to move on . 
that is why we consider a children ' s agenda , for instance , to be of paramount importance . 
if we understand that early childhood development is a key to a successful life , then we in government must understand that whatever we can do to support that is positive to the future . 
i was also very impressed with our commitment to research and development . 
there will be 2,000 new chairs in universities to create centres of excellence which will allow Canada to express its brain power to an even greater extent than it does at the present time . 
as my friend from Cambridge said , Canada is the best country in the world . 
if anybody does not believe it , I suggest they go anywhere else . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that was quite an interesting speech . 
i would like to highlight a couple of points my hon. colleague made . 
it is the taxes that have been wrung out of individuals , to the tune of $ 6 billion from people making $ 20,000 a year or less , that have balanced the budget and reduced the deficit , not the Liberal government . 
the member also mentioned that Liberals are the defenders of health care . 
they are the slashers and burners of health care . 
how can he do that ? 
Mr. Julian Reed : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the hon. member must have missed what I said . 
i did point out that every Canadian participated in the recovery of this country . 
it was not painless . 
i can assure my hon. friend , who will probably never experience this , that hard decisions are hard decisions . 
however , they have been made and they work . 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to highlight something that was not mentioned in the member ' s presentation or in the throne speech and that is that there was very little about agriculture and what help needs to be given to that area . 
what was mentioned in the throne speech were two things that could very much threaten agriculture and add more burden to our farmers . 
one was to implement the Kyoto protocol , the proposed carbon tax and the increased input costs that would result for farmers . 
the other was endangered species protection legislation , something everybody believes we should have , but the approach the new environment minister has taken is a heavy handed approach that will not work and does not include the co - operation of all people . 
i would like the member to comment on those two aspects that could seriously further harm the agriculture sector in this country . 
Mr. Julian Reed : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to point out to the hon. member that the steps that have been taken by this government are helping the Kyoto protocol and agriculture at the same time . 
maybe the hon. member does not know that since the biomass - derived ethanol program has been put into place nearly $ 500,000 of private investment has taken place across Canada , and farmers produce the feedstock for that ethanol production . 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the 15 years that I have had the privilege to sit in the House of Commons I have listened to a few throne speeches and it seems to me that what we ought to be considering is putting an end to throne speeches . 
people expect everything to be put into a throne speech , that the government is to outline in great detail its plans for the future . 
in reality , most Canadians are completely tuned out to this whole debate because they realize it is laced with partisanship . 
i would like to ask the hon. member whether he believes that throne speeches are of any real value to Canadians from coast to coast . 
would he not agree that instead of beginning a new session of parliament with a throne speech that it would be far more advisable to begin a new session of parliament with a budget so that there would be a specific plan on the table in which Canadians could engage in a real debate about the future of Canada ? 
Mr. Julian Reed : 
Mr. Speaker , that is a very interesting proposition . 
however , I would like to point out , and I am sure my hon. friend would agree , that when the legislative process starts it has to start with something , the vision . 
the purpose of the throne speech , traditionally , has been to present that overall vision to the House and to the people of Canada . 
if we had started without that there would be no vision . 
we have been accused from time to time of having no vision at all . 
i would like the hon. member to remember what it would be like if we did have some vision . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I understand the impatience of some hon. members with antique customs . 
you sit in that very uncomfortable chair which you have inherited from many generations of people overgrown on roast beef and port wine and various other things . 
let us face it , there are traditions . 
the value of the speech from the throne today is simply that it gives a larger vision of a governmental program that necessarily will be computized when we have those financial figures , when we know how much of a surplus there is and the battle over the distribution of it can be carried down to the details . 
this could be upset , but it is generally agreed that if there is a surplus , and we think there will be a very considerable surplus , as a result , as hon. members might say on this side , of government policies , it will be split at a principle of 50 % for tax reductions and amortization of the external debt , and 50 % for social programs . 
this is something that my constituents have strongly favoured . 
they have also asked that tax reductions extend to the working middle class who are very capable of creating the jobs , more perhaps than any other section of the community . 
that is something I will be working on for my constituents . 
i think it is a necessary part of our program of creating jobs . 
the Speech from the Throne outlined the three main areas of our policies on the government side as we go into the new century . 
one is , as I say , the work on tax reduction and the amortization of the debt . 
the second is spending on health and social programs . 
the third , and I will say a few more words on this , is the investment in knowledge as the key to the next century . 
my first assignment as a member when I was elected was to get $ 167.5 million from the finance minister , who had just inherited in 1993 a $ 42.8 billion budget deficit . 
how does one make the argument ? 
i had to go to the rounds of my colleagues and ministers and explain that there was a thing called pure research , that it did not necessarily bring results tomorrow , but five or ten years down the line it opened jobs and industry . 
pure knowledge can be translated concretely into factories , into production and into the creation of skilled jobs . 
we won that particular battle . 
it was easier to do it than in relation to some of the things we are doing now because , of course , education , research in a strict sense , on old fashioned constitutional views , is outside federal power . 
education is our investment in the future . 
i take great pride in the achievements , in the centres for excellence , in the centres for innovation and in the culmination of scholarships for the 21 st century . 
of the professorships there will be 1,200 immediately and 2,000 afterward . 
the actual idea was put forward by the president of the University of British Columbia and by the recteur de l ' Universit é de Montr éal. 
the idea was " arrest the brain drain '' . 
in certain areas like biochemistry , particle physics , pharmacology , and I could go on , we lead North America . 
we have world standards , but we run the risk of losing our best and our brightest . 
these two university presidents put forward the idea of linking this to the centres for innovation that would be presided over by the former president of the University of British Columbia , Dr. Strangway . 
this is the idea . 
i would pay tribute to caucus , my own and those of opposition parties . 
i did an informal poll in the last parliament and found that 50 MPs had colleges or universities in their constituencies and 18 or 20 had been professors or teachers . 
that is a powerful lobby and a group that has brought this emphasis on knowledge , on the investment in knowledge as the key to the new century . 
the Speech from the Throne covers many things . 
i have highlighted the quest for knowledge and the investment in learning as the key to the next century . 
there are several other matters that I will touch on very briefly , such as hands across the border . 
we are moving more and more to removing that barrier with the United States , those irritating delays in customs and elsewhere for Canadian citizens . 
this in spite of some pressures put on us in terms of problems in controlling our own entry to Canada from elsewhere . 
the movement is there . 
we have built on the record in the difficult area of reconciling our tradition as a country that receives people who want a better life . 
there are the boat people we have taken in the past . 
there are the Vietnamese admitted by a decision of a Conservative government . 
that community is one of the best communities in terms of low rates of unemployment and investment in new job creation . 
i look at the Ismailis who came here in 1971 under Prime Minister Trudeau , and the people who came from Cyprus when it broke up . 
we have a commitment to receiving people who have the talent and the will to make a better life . 
there are aspects here that are in terms of our international obligations . 
there is nothing inhibiting the Canadian government under international law from applying appropriate controls to our immigration for speeding up the process of determination of refugee claimants . 
i ask all members to address that in the future . 
the Speaker : 
as it is 2 o ' clock , we will now proceed to Statements by Members . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
chancellor ROBERT S . K . WELCH 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to congratulate the chancellor of Brock University on a very special honour . 
on Saturday , October 16 , the Faculty of Education building will be named after the chancellor , Robert S . K . Welch , in recognition of his contribution to Brock University . 
chancellor Welch has a long history of public service and deep roots in the Niagara community . 
from his first years on the St. Catharines Board of Education , Chancellor Welch rose in provincial politics to head the education ministry and later to the position of deputy premier of Ontario . 
his many years of service were acknowledged when he was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada in 1994 . 
the naming of the faculty of education building is a way for Brock to honour a man who has given so much of his time and energy to the institution over the many years . 
i join with students , faculty and friends to honour the important work of Robert Welch and the dedication he has shown for education in Niagara and in Ontario . 
the Speaker : 
i very rarely add anything to statements made by members , but I know Mr. Welch and it is an honour well deserved . 
he is one of the truly great people of that part of the country . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we support that as well . 
this week , as most Canadians celebrated Thanksgiving Day , Canadian farmers had little to celebrate . 
devastated by conditions beyond their control , farmers have been hit by the worst farm income crisis in recent memory and they have been abandoned by this government . 
this year thanksgiving did not make it to the farm . 
what did make it to the farm were record high input costs , record low commodity prices , increasing U.S. protectionism resulting in unjust tariffs against Canadian producers , bankruptcies that are erasing the next generation of family farms , and misguided and inadequate Liberal government contracts . 
it is time to reform aid programs to deliver assistance to farmers in need . 
it is time to give farmers the freedom to market their products as they choose . 
it is time for a government that will stand up for the farmers at the international trade table . 
* * * 
hazardous WASTE 
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , over the past five years hazardous waste imports from the United States into Ontario have nearly tripled . 
such imports include explosive chemicals , solvents , arsenic , mercury , benzene and other substances that can pose a threat to public health and the environment . 
regulations in Ontario are such that United States companies find it cheaper to ship their hazardous waste to Ontario rather than dispose of it at home . 
the federal government has signed the Basel convention and therefore has a responsibility for the safe disposal of hazardous waste coming across the border . 
therefore I urge the Government of Canada to exercise its authority under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and set strict conditions on the imports of hazardous waste into Canada so as to ensure an environmentally safe disposal . 
* * * 
the LATE ROSS HALL 
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Stoney Creek , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with regret that I rise to inform the House of the passing of Ross Hall , a talented leader who died October 11 at West Lincoln Memorial Hospital in Grimsby . 
he led by example and treated all with a sense of respect and understanding . 
our community has truly lost a model citizen . 
he will be missed . 
i ask hon. colleagues to please join with me in offering our sympathy to Ross ' wife Alison and his family at this very difficult time . 
* * * 
the LATE WILLIAM KAYE LAMB 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to commemorate the passing of William Kaye Lamb , librarian extraordinaire , who organized our nation ' s history as founder of the National Library of Canada . 
born on May 11 , 1904 in New Westminster , British Columbia , he died August 24 , 1999 in Vancouver at 95 years . 
prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1948 appointed him dominion archivist . 
lamb then created the National Library and drafted the National Library Act of 1952 . 
he proposed Canada ' s National Library and Archives which opened in 1967 . 
before retiring from the National Library in 1969 , he oversaw the first computerized library catalogue in the country . 
in his last days , a chief joy was sending out his trademark typewritten memos to fellow scholars . 
though work took him all over the world , a piece of him will always be in Ottawa . 
he will be remembered as a British Columbian who was a great builder of Canada . 
* * * 
auto PACT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the World Trade Organization issued an interim ruling ordering Canada to scrap the auto pact , the latest casualty of the Liberal government ' s liberalization at any cost trade policy . 
the auto pact is a model of fair managed trade providing auto manufacturers with duty free access to Canadian markets on the condition that they make significant investments in Canadian jobs and communities . 
the auto pact has played a key role in the creation of family supporting jobs in the manufacturing sector . 
auto companies working within the rules of the auto pact employ eight times as many workers in Canada as those who do not . 
the Liberals say they care about the auto pact but it was these same Liberals who negotiated the rules which the WTO is now using to kill the auto pact . 
it was these same Liberals who assured Canadians that the auto pact would be safeguarded . 
it is incumbent on the Liberals now to find a way to uphold the principles of the auto pact and support Canadian jobs . 
it must appeal the WTO ruling , rethink its uncritical and simplistic commitment to free trade , and failing all this , develop equivalent policies that reward auto manufacturers for investing in Canadian jobs and communities . 
* * * 
arts AND CULTURE 
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased that Canadian culture figures so prominently in the Speech from the Throne . 
the throne speech set out a global strategy to build a better quality of life for all Canadians and to implement policies that make a difference in the lives of individual Canadians . 
writers , singers , actors , filmmakers and artists breathe life into our culture while others record our history and protect our cultural heritage . 
this reaffirms the government ' s commitment to culture , linking 1,000 institutions across the country to form a virtual museum , putting collections on line , increasing support for the production of Canadian stories and images in print , theatre , music and video . 
* * * 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week , Quebec lost one of its greatest artists , actor Jean - Louis Millette , who had raised his art to the heights of intensity . 
everything Jean - Louis Millette undertook grew to significant proportions reflecting his talent . 
he approached each work with integrity , generosity and humanity . 
humble and simple , he served the author , charmed the public , and was respected by his colleagues . 
his talent universally acclaimed , he moved us in the theatre , on television and in film . 
the emotion he left us will survive him . 
the emotion he shared with children , through his Paillasson character , is forever in our hearts . 
while an actor ' s work is essentially ephemeral , Jean - Louis Millette ' s interpretations remain . 
we thank you , Jean - Louis Millette , for all the joy you brought us . 
* * * 
OKTOBERFEST 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , during this past weekend Kitchener - Waterloo welcomed thousands of visitors from across the continent to kick off the 31 st annual Oktoberfest celebrations . 
in fact members of this House came to Kitchener to join in the great German tradition . 
this nine day festival is the largest Bavarian celebration in North America with the greatest Thanksgiving Day parade in Canada . 
Oktoberfest has become an important cultural event for our nation . 
it symbolizes what it is like to live in a multicultural nation . 
i congratulate the over 400 volunteers who make Oktoberfest such a great success each year . 
in particular I recognize the hard work of Oktoberfest president Auggie Sherban . 
he should be commended for his outstanding commitment and dedication to this important cultural event . 
* * * 
children 
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) : 
in short , our vision and focus is our children . 
imagine the legacy . 
we will ensure an increase in the quality of life for our children . 
sadly , not everyone agrees with this vision of investing in our children . 
for reasons which I suspect are for political gain , the leader of the Reform Party suggests this is nothing more than fluff , no real substance , I think he said . 
let me inform the leader of the Reform Party that my children are not mere fluff . 
we can only assume his comments will continue to be damaging to himself and to our children . 
* * * 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , three years ago Reform ' s finance critic at the time , Herb Grubel , told me that the best primer on economics was a book called Man and Economics by Robert Mundell . 
believe it or not , I checked all the major bookstores in Canada and could not find it . 
finally by a happy coincidence I found Mr. Mundell ' s book in the discard bin in the public library in the little town where I live . 
and yes it is a wonderful lucid book . 
Robert Mundell was a man in advance of his age . 
he was a prophet without honour in his own country until yesterday . 
yesterday Robert Mundell , born in Kingston , Ontario and raised in the interior of B.C. , was awarded the Nobel prize for economics . 
today governments around the world are applying his supply side tax cut ideas and their economies are booming and providing their citizens with jobs and prosperity , including right here in Ontario . 
on behalf of the official opposition , we extend hearty congratulations to Canada ' s Robert Mundell . 
finally I would like to offer a copy of the book to the finance minister , as long as he will read it and give it back to me . 
* * * 
community CARE WORKER WEEK 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to remind the House and all Canadians that the week of October 11 to 17 is Community Care Worker Week . 
the professionals , paraprofessionals and volunteers who provide health care in the community are an integral part of our health care system . 
they are the front line workers providing home care , long term institutional care , meal distribution services and community support programs . 
to acknowledge the invaluable contribution workers make to the health of Canadians , the Canadian Association for Community Care together with Lifeline Systems Canada has initiated the Community Care Worker Award which is presented every year during Community Care Worker Week . 
i invite you to join me in thanking community care workers throughout Canada for their contribution to the health of Canadians . 
* * * 
world DAY FOR THE REFUSAL OF MISERY 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October 17 has been proclaimed World Day for the refusal of misery by the United Nations . 
this day will stress the exclusion and isolation experienced on a daily basis by an increasing number of women , men and children , while also urging us to take a hard look at our way of doing things , so as to eliminate this wall of shame for our society . 
beyond any statistical consideration , poverty means being excluded from any form of full participation as a citizen ; it means that one cannot participate in the benefits of economic growth and it also suppresses the fundamental right to work . 
poverty means the outright withdrawal of freedom of speech for those who are affected by it . 
tackling poverty is an enormous challenge . 
we must do so with determination , with our heads high , and we must not be afraid of telling things as they are , while being receptive to those who live in poverty . 
* * * 
liberal GOVERNMENT 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as we begin this new session , let us take a look at the parties in the House of Commons . 
as for the Bloquistes , they have yet to find a reason to exist except , perhaps , their pensions , unlike the Liberal government , which knows exactly where it is headed . 
the Liberals are governing according to the priorities of Canadians , so as to provide them with a better economic , social and political future . 
congratulations to the Liberal government . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the supreme court ruling on the hunting and fishing rights of native Canadians , a crisis has grown in the lobster fishery on the east coast . 
parliament must act immediately to demonstrate the leadership that the federal government has failed to provide . 
i urgently request the agreement of all parties to facilitate the immediate reinstatement of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans . 
the committee should immediately go first to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia where tensions are tearing traditionally peaceful communities apart along racial lines . 
let us hear directly from those involved , accept the responsibility entrusted to us and seek to establish a constructive environment for agreement . 
we all want a peaceful solution . 
the PC Party of Canada is prepared to take this action . 
i call on all my caucus colleagues and all members of the House to join us in - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Saanich - Gulf Islands . 
* * * 
WILLIAM HEAD INSTITUTION 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , convicted wife killer , Patrick Lees , has just begun his sentence at William Head prison in Victoria . 
inmates refer to William Head as Club Fed. 
why ? 
the inmates reside in condominiums , no steel bars , no locks on the doors , many of the bedrooms have TVs and VCRs and each condo has its own living room , dining room and kitchen . 
let us not forget its waterfront location equipped with golf course , fishing pier and much more . 
spousal abuse is a huge problem in our society . 
Patrick Lees violently murdered his wife , left two young children without a mom and now we see this wife killer sent to Club Fed. 
there is a place in the system for institutions where inmates must learn to care for themselves . 
however , prisoners must earn the right to transfer to these institutions . 
i am working on a private member ' s bill where an inmate would not be eligible for this type of institution until they have completed at least 50 % of their time . 
i urge all members to work with me to change the system . 
* * * 
presence IN GALLERY 
the Speaker : 
colleagues , I am going to change things just a little bit for today . 
i want to draw to your attention the presence in the gallery of Her Excellency Libuse Benesova , President of the Senate of the Czech Republic , and her parliamentary delegation . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
fisheries 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
thirty years ago when the Prime Minister was minister of Indian affairs he professed to believe that assigning rights to different people based on their race would only lead to further discrimination , recrimination and the kinds of violence that we see now in New Brunswick . 
why has the prime minister and his government abandoned that position ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I said in the House of Commons that treaties were signed by the government of the day , by Her Majesty the Queen of England at that time . 
we have an obligation to respect the treaty that was entered into by previous governments , particularly with the natives . 
these agreements were signed . 
the supreme court passed a judgment and we have to respect that within the confines of the judgment that gave collective rights . 
we have the right to impose measures to maintain the conservation that is needed so that stocks can be there for years to come . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
what the supreme court should have been doing in the Marshall case is balancing these rights not just affirming one side . 
why does the Prime Minister not take control of this situation , ask the supreme court to stay its decision and return to a fisheries policy that is based on equality under the law and conservation not race ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the treaties were signed with the natives of the day . 
it is an obligation of the government and of the nation to respect the obligation that we have taken with them . 
there was a judgment by the supreme court that said that it is a collective right that has to be managed within the need for conservation . 
this is exactly what the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is working on at this moment . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is not listening to what is being said . 
no one is denying the fact of aboriginal rights . 
however , the government , under its constitutional authority for the fishery , has also granted rights to others to fish . 
that is what a fishing licence is . 
what we are looking for is some leadership from the government in balancing these rights . 
i ask the Prime Minister again , why does he not ask the supreme court for a stay of this judgment and why does he not come up with a fishery policy that recognizes equality under the law not special entitlement simply based on race ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , these rights have been confirmed by the court . 
the Leader of the Opposition takes pleasure in saying that he respects the rights but does not want the judgment implemented . 
that is like having your cake and eating it at the same time . 
some licences have been granted for a long time , but this judgment adds new fishermen to the business . 
this has to be worked out in conjunction with those who were there before and those who have new authority from the supreme court to use their fishing rights . 
we have to get the two parties together . 
to have your cake and eat it all the time like the leader - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Delta - South Richmond . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the purpose of asking for a stay of judgment is to ask the court to clarify its decision . 
the month long window to petition the court to stay this decision and clarify it is up in three days . 
so far the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Prime Minister have opted to allow chaos and violence to determine the course of events . 
is the Prime Minister now so comfortable with a race based fisheries policy that he will not even ask the supreme court to clarify its decision ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , every time there is a conclusion by the courts that the natives of Canada were here before , they always refer to it as a racist situation . 
they were here before we were . 
the king of the day told the settlers who were coming to Canada to make treaties with them . 
it is our obligation to respect the words of Her Majesty the Queen of those days . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me give the Prime Minister examples . 
it is unclear what the supreme court means by a modest living or whether non - status natives will enjoy this preferential right to fish that is allowed by the Marshall decision . 
flawed as it is , this decision needs clarification to establish the place of non - aboriginal fishermen in this fishery , fishermen whose families have been fishing these waters for 200 and 300 years . 
why is the government refusing to return court for clarification of this irresponsible and unrealistic decision ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the judgment has been rendered . 
we have to live with the judgment . 
we are obliged to respect judgments . 
we can ask for a stay to gain some time to plan a proper regime . 
however , whenever some rights are recognized for the first people of the land , the Reform Party always attacks them as racist . 
it is absolutely not Canadian .

GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Minister of Industry called Quebec Minister Landry irresponsible for putting forward a plan to save the only automobile plant in Quebec , the GM plant in Boisbriand and , with it , thousands of jobs in the region , when there are 14 such plants in Ontario . 
how can the minister make such statements ? 
and when he does , is he not behaving more like Ontario ' s Minister of Industry than the federal Minister of Industry ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting that the Bloc Quebecois is so in favour of an offer for a company such as this , which has made phenomenal profits . 
in Montreal , La Presse asked the question of the day , that is : " Quebec is prepared to put up $ 360 million to save GM in Boisbriand . 
do you think it should ? " 
and 19 % said yes , while 81 % said no . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is not much of an answer . 
it does show , however , that the Liberals are well organized when it comes to contacting La Presse . 
this morning , I spoke to Luc Desnoyers , Quebec ' s delegate to the CAW . 
i also spoke with the president of the union at the GM plant in Boisbriand . 
both said that the minister was dragging his feet , that he had done nothing for the cause , and that he was doing nothing to defend Quebec ' s workers . 
i ask the Prime Minister , who talks to us about collaboration , partnership and understanding , how he can stand by and watch his minister do absolutely nothing to help save the Boisbriand plant . 
it is a disgrace . 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is not true that we are not doing anything . 
in fact , it was the Government of Canada that first sat down with the Boisbriand workers . 
we were the ones who funded the project to put together a presentation for GM officials . 
we were the ones who carried the case forward with the GM officials in Detroit . 
i personally arranged a meeting with the president of GM in the United States , in Detroit , and invited Premier Bouchard to attend , just as Mr. Harris had gone to Seattle a few months ago to talk with Boeing . 
Mr. Bouchard sent Mr. Landry . 
together , we discussed the future of the Boisbriand project with GMr . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we learned from this morning ' s La Presse that the automotive manufacturers are being offered some extremely attractive incentives to stay in the U.S. or to develop new plants there . 
we learned also that Bernard Landry has made an interesting proposal as part of the efforts being made on the North American continent to save the Montreal plant . 
does the Minister of Industry seriously think he is going to be believed when he says he has done everything to save GM , when he has in fact stood back with his arms crossed , to all intents and purposes , for some time ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , does the hon. member seriously think that offering a lot of money before any demands are even made is a good negotiating approach ? 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , like the rest of Canada , Quebec has to compete internationally , and we need to be proactive when it comes to saving jobs . 
Bernard Landry was proactive . 
he sought a way of saving the plant . 
it would be nice to be able to say the same of the minister . 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is absolutely false , because we , the Government of Canada , are the ones who tried to help GM find solutions for Boisbriand . 
he does not understand that the problem is not a financial one . 
it is not a problem that could be solved with a donation from the taxpayers to a highly profitable company . 
it is a matter of finding a model , a future for a project . 
why has GM invested money in Ontario without getting any federal funds , as have other automobile manufacturers ? 
why ?

agriculture 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
the federal government ' s response to the farm income crisis has been a disaster . 
for Saskatchewan and Manitoba farmers AIDA has been a disaster . 
less than half of those needing help qualify , and for those who do the payments are too low . 
most provincial ministers of agriculture are in Ottawa today . 
will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to admit that AIDA has been a disaster and announce a plan that will work for prairie farmers ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I met with the ministers of agriculture from two western provinces today . 
i reminded them of the money that has been put into the AIDA program . 
we made changes to crop insurance . 
we made changes to the NISA program . 
we made changes to the AIDA program and we continue to look for all the resources we possibly can . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
now the Prime Minister ducks the question . 
i think we heard that from a previous Liberal prime minister as well . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am following the situation very closely . 
that is why we are working with the ministers . 
it is the crisis that is a problem . 
long before the leader of the party was aware of the problem money was already on the table to solve the crisis .

fisheries 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stated in the House " We have a solution in place and we have a plan '' . 
he was referring to the fishery . 
while he was saying that , the aboriginal leaders were meeting in Moncton , New Brunswick . 
last night when I informed the minister that the chiefs had decided to shut down the moratorium , he stated that he had not been contacted by the chiefs . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
given that the chiefs have now stated that they have no trust in the minister of fisheries , will the Prime Minister personally accept responsibility for this situation and step in immediately to resolve it ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is important to look at the facts . 
the moratorium was on a voluntary basis by the chiefs . 
what has happened now is they have said that they will leave it up to the individual chiefs . 
i talked to Chief Sark today from Lennox Island and he said he would continue with the moratorium . 
it is left up to the individual chiefs to decide on their own . 
we have a plan for the short term and the long term . 
it is working and I will continue with it . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week when the minister of fisheries went to Halifax to try to negotiate a settlement for the crisis in the fishery , the minister could not get an agreement . 
in fact the agreement came from the chiefs themselves . 
today , because of the actions of the minister ' s department , the voluntary moratorium which restored peace to our communities back east has now collapsed . 
native leaders now say they simply cannot trust the minister , and that was their quote . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
does the Prime Minister understand that the number one barrier to a negotiated solution to this issue is his own minister ? 
i am begging the Prime Minister to step into this situation and deal with it . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we should make sure we understand the facts . 
i met with the processors . 
i was there to listen to them , to make sure we had a dialogue . 
as a result of the discussions the chiefs decided on their own that they wanted to have a voluntary moratorium . 
it is always hard to get 35 chiefs to agree to a unanimous decision . 
they have decided now that they will leave it up to individual chiefs . 
some chiefs will continue with it .

agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with all the agriculture minister says that he has done for farmers , why are thousands of dirt poor farmers still getting nothing , no cash ? 
to date the government has done nothing to address the crisis in any serious way . 
AIDA does not work and there is no replacement in sight . 
families are losing their farms right now , not tomorrow , and the government sits idly by . 
why is the Prime Minister allowing our farmers to head into winter with no hope and no cash ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I find these comments very interesting , coming from an hon. member who stood in the public a year ago and said farmers should stop their crying . 
the government knew that farmers needed help . 
we have put $ 900 million there . 
we have made changes to the net income stabilization program that enabled the withdrawal of more than $ 120 million in that program . 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Selkirk - Interlake . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the agriculture minister is a liar . 
i did not say - 
some hon. members : 
withdraw , withdraw . 
the Speaker : 
i ask the hon. member to please withdraw that statement . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
Yes. 
i recognize , Mr. Speaker , that is not an appropriate statement .

GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , whatever the Minister of Industry may say or do , he is not helping matters with his attitude and his remarks . 
my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
given his attitude , are we not totally justified in asking whether he does not intend to sacrifice the Boisbriand plant in favour of plants in Ontario , his home province ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that question is totally strange , because , as I said , we worked with GM to save jobs at Boisbriand . 
in fact , another car model needs to be found for manufacture at Boisbriand . 
i told him that significant investments have been made in the Canadian automobile industry in the past five or six years . 
there has never been a need for the federal government to invest because we are very competitive . 
at Boisbriand , the employees are top quality and highly trained and could compete with - 
the Speaker : 
the member for T é miscamingue . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in its throne speech , the government mentions partnership a lot . 
we did not think there would be an example so soon . 
i would like the Prime Minister to say whether he does not consider the example and the attitude of his minister with regard Boisbriand do not reveal the essence of the word partnership . 
is that what partnership means ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
he did a very good job , but , as he has said , the problem right now is that major changes are being made in the whole of the GM organization throughout North America , and Boisbriand is in competition with the others . 
investments have been made in Canada , and at no time in the automobile industry in recent years have we - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. leader of the Reform Party . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government ' s response to the western farm crisis is an absolute insult to western Canada . 
the realized net income for all farmers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan collectively will be down by 98 % for the four year average . 
does the Prime Minister understand that 98 % means down from $ 916 million a year to $ 16 million ? 
the government ' s response to date has been pathetic : an aid program that does not work , an income stabilization program that does not work , and no high level attack on the European subsidies which are at the root of the problem . 
when will the Prime Minister take some personal interest and show some personal leadership - 
the Speaker : 
the Right Hon. Prime Minister . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
that is what they say to gain votes . 
now that we have put money on the table they just flip - flop completely and want us to spend money when - 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
i would ask both the questioners and those who answer to please keep their questions within 35 seconds . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister should have kept on reading from that statement because the next sentences talked about Reform ' s proposal for a trade distortion program that would have solved this problem . 
incidentally the member who proposed that program is now just about five seats away from becoming the premier of Saskatchewan . This is not just about statistics . 
this is not a statistical problem . 
it is families that are suffering not just the loss of their livelihoods but their farms - 
the Speaker : 
if the Prime Minister wants to address himself to the preamble , I would invite him to do so . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will reply in 90 seconds and not in 90 minutes . 
before the last budget the government put $ 900 million on the table and the provinces put $ 600 million directed toward this problem . 
why does the Reform Party complain all the time when we spend money ? 
now he wants to cut money and have a new program . 
he cannot have it that way .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Onex issue , the Minister of Transport is now prepared , after having suspended application of the Competition Act and after having refused to let the transport committee sit during the summer , to set aside the 10 % ownership rule . 
is the strange behaviour of the minister in this matter dictated by the cozy relationship that exists between Onex and his government ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said yesterday , it became quite evident over the last few months that Canadian Airlines was in trouble . 
it either needed a cash injection from the government , in other words a bailout , or we had to let it slide into insolvency or we had to find another way to solve the problem . 
we invoked section 47 which allows us to find market driven solutions but which also allows the government and parliament to pronounce upon any agreement that comes forward with shareholders and to set conditions in the public interest . 
i have enunciated five principles . 
i said them yesterday and I could say them again , but the government will do what is in the best interest of Canadians . 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the president of Onex , Mr. Schwartz , also said that the delays imposed by the Competition Bureau would , in his opinion , be too long . 
can the minister tell us whether or not , and regardless of the opinion of the president of Onex , this transaction will be reviewed by the Competition Bureau ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , under section 47 , which we use , the Competition Bureau is engaged . 
in fact it is giving us advice on restructuring and that advice will be made available within the next couple of weeks and certainly will be made public . 
the fact is that the Competition Bureau ' s role is one that has been underlined . 
it is still there and it will still be involved in any consideration . 
as to any specific agreement , I do not believe that it is my role to talk about any proposal that is now before the shareholders of a private company . 
when that company decides , when the shareholders decide , then the government will act in the public interest . 
* * * 
government CONTRACTS 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Claude Gauthier , owner of Transelec , donated $ 10,000 to the Prime Minister ' s campaign after winning a CIDA contract . 
he then bought a $ 500,000 piece of land from a company in which the Prime Minister has a financial interest and the bidding for that was , shall we say , suspicious . 
it turns out that Transelec is not quite doing the job and the government has been worried about being on the hook ever since . 
why is the Prime Minister putting his political interest ahead of the public interest ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first , CIDA does not hold the contract with Transelec . 
the contract is held between the government of the African Republic of Mali and Transelec . 
second , CIDA funds the project and pays the bills according to the Mali government , as they are submitted . 
third , this company ' s bid was 30 % lower than the next lowest bid . 
the project will be finished in the near future and it will be done at no additional cost . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
what a steal of a deal , Mr. Speaker . 
that is great comfort . 
let me paint a clearer picture for the Prime Minister himself . 
the minister talks about the awarding process and the process for bidding . 
it was certainly suspicious at the very least . 
it is a process for a pal . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
i would urge members on both sides to be very judicious in their choice of words . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
i would just say that when somebody makes a bid 30 % lower than the others , when it is the lowest bid , $ 3 million lower than the others , I think the government of Mali did pretty well in giving the contract to that contractor .

parental LEAVE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one of the most popular measures mentioned in the throne speech is the proposal to double the length of parental leave . 
this is good news . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te : 
it is good news , and we all agree on that , but why will this measure come into effect in 2001 and not now ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , recognizing the changing relationship between the workforce and Canadian families , this government knows that it is appropriate for parents to be at home in the early years with their children . 
yesterday the Prime Minister announced a doubling of parental benefits for Canadian families . 
that is a significant investment in our children and in our families , and are we ever proud . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food . 
yesterday the WTO issued a ruling on Canada ' s imports and exports of milk . 
can the minister tell us whether this in any way threatens our excellent system of supply management for dairies ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
we were very pleased with the tariff rate quotas for fluid milk . 
the appellant body overthrew the ruling of the panel on that in Canada ' s favour . 
a little portion of the export of dairy products from Canada will be affected by the ruling , but the dairy industry itself has said that it is all right , they can adjust to that little portion , which does not affect supply management in Canada . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when the Prime Minister took office he failed to disclose under conflict of interest guidelines a $ 200,000 asset owed to his numbered company . 
his same company later happened to benefit from a land sale to the lucky winner of a huge CIDA contract , land enriched by a government grant to a nearby hotel . 
what was the Prime Minister trying to hide by not disclosing the $ 200,000 asset ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , everybody knows about it . 
i have been informed that the person who owed the money has paid it all . 
there is no debt any more . 
i filed the form as it was presented to me and there was no such request . 
but if we have to declare when we deposit $ 5 in the bank that the bank owes us $ 5 , probably we would have to write it in the form the next time . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
it was an asset which he did not disclose under his own conflict of interest guidelines . 
the Prime Minister must know how important it is to the Canadian public that they have confidence in his ethical standards . 
if his behaviour is above reproach , why has he refused to table the documents which will lay all of these questions to rest ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the trustee is managing this problem . 
the government has given a clear indication that there was no such request from anybody . 
my trustee was given all the assets and managed them . 
i pray to God that when I am not Prime Minister 10 years from now there will still be some assets that I can get . 
* * * 
child CARE 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech passed over Canadian children rather quickly by neglecting to mention any concrete plans for national child care . 
Canadian children need good quality care , not just in the first year of life but in all of their pre - school years . 
will the minister commit today to a national child care program that her government promised six years ago ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
it was part of our program . 
we wanted to do that , but all the provinces , including the NDP governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan , refused to have a joint program on day care . 
we found another way to help families and we were successful . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is trying to get off the hook . 
the fact is that when it comes to kids the government is full of bafflegab . 
let us try to get a clear answer . 
does the Prime Minister understand that a so - called children ' s agenda is worthless unless it includes child care ? 
will the minister and the Prime Minister remember that children have to be included in a children ' s agenda ? 
when are we going to see the national child care program ? 
exactly where are the 150,000 spaces that were promised ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just explained that the NDP governments of the land rejected the offer we made to them . 
with the refusal of the so - called left governments , which are to the right of the Liberal Party , we found other ways , through tax exemptions and other tax incentives , to help families because we were more preoccupied about child care than the NDP governments .

fisheries 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is the minister ' s record up to now in the east coast lobster crisis : no moratorium , homes burned , businesses destroyed , neighbour fighting neighbour , and 200 years of harmony between natives and non - natives jeopardized . 
the fear and uncertainty in this free - for - all continues . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that hon. members recognize the difficult situation . 
that is why we have to be careful not to inflame the situation . 
we have set forward a short term plan as well as a long term plan . 
i think what we have to do now is work toward ensuring that the aboriginal community can exercise that treaty right toward a long term plan . 
that is exactly what we are doing . 
i am encouraged by all of the co - operation that is happening at the community level . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just cited the minister ' s record on the short term plan . 
it is a disaster . 
we have eighth generation fishermen whose livelihood is threatened . 
there is a crisis in the community and the minister talks about a plan that does not exist . 
if the minister does have a plan , can he show us what that plan is ? 
the only plan the minister has now is a plan for continued chaos . 
will the minister act , and act quickly ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , we are already acting . 
my colleagues and I are working as a government to make sure that we have a dialogue , we have co - operation and we bring people together . 
the real solutions are at the community base , where people start talking to people , coming up with real solutions for the long term . 
that is exactly what we are doing .

child CARE 
Mr. John O ' Reilly ( Haliburton - Victoria - Brock , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in light of the recent announcement by the Prime Minister that parental leave will be extended from six months to one full year , can the Minister of Human Resources Development tell this House what effect this decision will have on working Canadians ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the daily Le Devoir writes " After some difficult years , Ottawa wants to take advantage of its sound fiscal position to improve parental leave . 
bravo '' . 
Mr. Speaker , we deliver .

employment 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
why has the minister ' s department not put in place a strategy to assure Canada ' s auto workers that their jobs are safe , knowing the likely result of this ruling ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the member of my full confidence in the automobile industry of this country . 
it is a strong and very healthy industry . 
yesterday we received a confidential interim report , which could be seen in the Globe and Mail this morning as well as a number of others papers . 
it is a 400 page report . 
we are looking into it . 
we are analyzing it . 
we will continue to have very close consultations with the stakeholders and with the provinces as well .

native PEOPLES 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
yesterday , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced that 33 out of 35 band councils had agreed to the moratorium . 
today , the number is zero . 
we are in troubled waters and the one voice we do not hear is that of the new Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs . 
i give him an opportunity to explain . 
since his government and the supreme court have confirmed the right of native peoples to a regulated fishery , why is the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs not negotiating his own moratorium with them and offering them compensation ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday we will be having a meeting with all the partners . 
the partners , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I are working on a long term plan and I hope to announce it next week . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I should remind the government that there is no lobster fishery going on in the Rideau Canal . 
this is day 27 after the Marshall decision and there is still no leadership from this government . 
the Prime Minister himself said the parties have to get together . 
instead of hiding behind government bureaucrats in Ottawa , why are the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans not down in the maritime region right now dealing with the stakeholders ? 
why are they not committing the necessary resources to meet the negotiations before something comes up that we cannot handle ? 
will the minister commit today to go down to the maritime region ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am here answering his question . 
the answer to it is they will be coming here on Monday .

fisheries 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the rejection of the 30 day moratorium on fishing in the Atlantic region shows clearly that the minister is continuing to ignore the seriousness of the situation . 
this government has shown the people most directly concerned that it has absolutely no leadership . 
through its clumsy handling of the situation , the government has struck fear into the hearts of fishers in towns and villages throughout Atlantic Canada . 
what has the government done and what does it intend to do to restore a feeling of security and peace of mind to people in native and non - native communities ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious the member was not listening to the answer just given a few minutes ago . 
we are working on a long term plan . 
we are meeting with the aboriginal community . 
i think the hon. member will be able to check that what we said earlier answers the question pretty clearly .

business OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is great that I get a question . 
at least once a week I am assured of this . 
i would like to ask the government House leader , who has all of this wisdom about what is coming up in the House of Commons , what the nature of the legislation is for the remainder of this week and next week . 
i would also like to know whether or not the government is going to stop the legislation coming forth on the Nisga ' a agreement because as you know , Mr. Speaker , we are prepared to fight , fight , fight on that issue . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am equally pleased to answer the question because it is once a week when I get to answer a question . 
today , tomorrow and Monday we will continue with the address debate . 
there will be votes at the end of the day today , as well as at the end of the day on Monday on the main amendment to the throne speech . 
on Tuesday morning we will have the debate on my motion to refer Bill C - 2 , the elections legislation , to committee before second reading . 
this debate may last up to three hours . 
once it is completed , we will consider the electronic commerce bill that will be reintroduced tomorrow . 
in the last session that bill was Bill C - 54 . 
i expect the debate on this bill will carry us through the rest of the day on Tuesday and possibly as late as next Wednesday . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the government House leader with respect to government business and the legislative agenda . 
the government House leader will recall that the government made a commitment in the last session of parliament to bring in legislation with respect to a national ban on the bulk export of water . 
there was no mention of this in the throne speech but it had at one time or another been indicated that it might be part of the legislative calendar . 
i wonder if the government House leader can tell us , will there be such legislation and when will it be forthcoming ? 
the Speaker : 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as I know it is still the plan of the government to introduce such legislation in the fall sitting of this parliament . 
as to an exact date , there are ongoing consultations between House leaders . 
i will inform my colleagues as soon as possible . 
at the present time it is still part of the fall legislative agenda . 
the Speaker : 
before I recognize the member for York South - Weston , I would simply remind him that this has to do with legislation being put forth by the government for the House to consider in the next week . 
with that in mind , I turn the floor over to the member for York South - Weston . 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister indicated that it is the plan of the government to send the elections bill to committee before second reading . 
that is an unusual procedure to follow . 
there are established rules in the House that require a second reading debate before a bill is referred to committee . 
could the minister explain why he is taking this unusual route with this bill ? 
the Speaker : 
this is part of our body of rules right now . 
it is my understanding the minister will make known his reasons . 
when he introduces the bill he will be the first speaker . 
it is part of our body of rules and as I understand it has been since 1997 . 
an hon. member : 
since 1993 . 
the Speaker : 
i will check into it . 
i was told it was 1997 .

privilege 
CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to make what I consider to be a very serious question of privilege . 
this question of privilege arises from a lawsuit that was launched against me in 1996 but does not pertain to the actions of the individual who filed the lawsuit . 
rather it concerns the activities and conduct of a government agency , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , during the course of this lawsuit . 
to begin , I want to say that I do not question the established precedent that prevents a member from using privilege to guard against the lawsuit for what is said outside of the House . 
this question of privilege has absolutely nothing to do with that . 
instead , I will provide prima facie evidence to the Chair that demonstrates how the conduct and activities of CSIS regarding this case form what I believe to be a new and disturbing method of intimidation of a member of parliament . 
i will show that CSIS improperly collected information and then subsequently disclosed that information in clear violation of CSIS policy to a third party . 
i will show that CSIS abandoned the traditional non - partisan role of the public service by taking an active role in the preparation of a lawsuit against an opposition member of parliament , including having its legal counsel provide the plaintiff and the plaintiff ' s lawyer with advice . 
finally , I will show that CSIS misused its extraordinary authority to protect national security , was twice sanctioned for misconduct and deliberately misled the court to frustrate my ability to resolve the lawsuit . 
thus the gist of my question of privilege is the deliberate effort of CSIS to intimidate me from speaking freely in the House of Commons and from performing my role as official opposition critic . 
i raise this issue today because this is the first opportunity to do so since the completion of my court case . 
although the standing orders state that the sub judice convention only applies in a civil lawsuit during the trial days of the proceedings , I undertook an agreement with the Board of Internal Economy not to utilize this lawsuit for political purposes . 
at the time I entered into that agreement , I was unaware of the role that CSIS had played in the case up to that time , nor could I possibly have envisioned the role that CSIS would subsequently take in this case . 
i have lived up to my obligation with the BOIE and have bided my time until today , my opportunity to raise this issue . 
as I previously mentioned , this form of intimidation is unprecedented . 
however in Erskine May , 21 st edition , page 115 states that an offence for contempt " may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence . 
on October 29 , 1980 , a Speaker of this House had this to say : 
- the dimension of contempt of parliament is such that the House will not be constrained in finding a breach of privilege of members , or of the House . 
this is precisely the reason that , while our privileges are defined , contempt of the House has no limits . 
let me provide this brief summary of the evidence in the documents that I have before me that confirms their efforts to intimidate me . 
i am prepared to read it all but would prefer just to provide it to you , Mr. Speaker . 
almost all the information contained in the plaintiff ' s statement of claim originated from CSIS . 
in fact the statement of claim contains a copy of my press release which bears the fax identification of the former solicitor general which was sent to CSIS . 
the plaintiff ' s affidavit of documents consists of 107 documents which included some of my press releases , as well as newspaper clippings , radio and television transcripts from media outlets across the country . 
every one of them came from CSIS , some of them before and some of them after the commencement of the lawsuit . 
the plaintiff also included four video tapes of media reports , all of which were recorded by CSIS and forwarded to the plaintiff . 
in a discovery of the plaintiff conducted on February 17 , 1998 , the plaintiff admitted in regard to the video tapes that " they were provided to me without my asking '' . 
both the plaintiff and his lawyer admitted during the proceedings that CSIS assisted the plaintiff in the preparation of his lawsuit . 
in a letter dated July 20 , 1998 , from the plaintiff ' s lawyer to my lawyer the following passage is included : " certain members of CSIS have co - operated with the plaintiff in preparation of his case '' . 
at a discovery of the plaintiff at the federal court on November 3 , 1998 , the plaintiff acknowledged that part of the reason he had contacted a senior manager at CSIS was to discuss the means by which he would proceed with his lawsuit . 
as well , at that same discovery the lawyer for the plaintiff admitted that " the legal counsel for CSIS had spoken with me from time to time , and I am sure with the plaintiff from time to time , trying to give us advice '' . 
thus it is clear from these comments that CSIS played a role in the preparation and conduct of the lawsuit against me . 
what is of particular concern is the fact that throughout the discoveries it was confirmed that it was Mr. Tom Bradley who played the key role in providing all this information to the plaintiff . 
this is of concern because Tom Bradley is , or was until recently , a senior member of the CSIS secretariat . 
on the CSIS organizational chart the secretariat answers directly to the director of CSIS and among their duties was liaison between CSIS and the solicitor general ' s office . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
this is a question of privilege . 
it does affect all of us . 
i invite members , if they have other meetings , to please carry them on in the lobby . 
i am sure that I as well as many others want to hear what the member is saying . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , the CSIS Act clearly limits what information CSIS can collect , generally restricting it to information that may on reasonable grounds be suspected of constituting threats to the security of Canada . 
i would suggest that the CSIS collection of all this information was improper . 
as limiting as the laws are restricting the ability of CSIS to collect information , they are equally restrictive with regard to the ability of the service to disclose any information collected . 
section 19 of the CSIS Act severely restricts the information it may disclose and nowhere in this section does it permit the disclosure of information to a private individual to assist his lawsuit against a member of parliament . 
in addition to the CSIS Act , section 3 . ( 7 ) of the human resources policy manual states that employees must not support or oppose any person , organization or product by using information obtained through their employment by the service except when authorized by the director . 
it is quite clear that the disclosure of this information to the plaintiff was in violation of the service ' s own policy . 
unfortunately CSIS was not satisfied with the role in assisting with the preparation of the lawsuit against me . 
immediately following the court ' s granting of the aforementioned order , counsel for CSIS filed a certificate of objection signed by Jim Corcoran , CSIS deputy director of operations , with Madam Justice MacLeod pursuant to sections 37 and 38 of the Canada Evidence Act . 
in that certificate Mr. Corcoran claimed that disclosure of the information requested in 32 of the 38 questions which were ordered to be answered would be " injurious to the national security of Canada '' . 
the remaining six questions were considered personal . 
in July , I was forced to challenge the validity of that certificate through a notice of application filed in the federal court . 
on October 5 , Mr. Justice Teitelbaum ruled that CSIS must make Denofsky available for cross - examination and costs were awarded against CSIS . 
my lawyer filed a notice of motion requiring CSIS to produce Mr. Denofsky for further cross - examination , requiring him to answer the questions he had previously refused . 
the day before the federal court hearing on January 14 , almost 11 weeks after Mr. Denofsky ' s cross - examination , CSIS provided responses to 39 of the 51 questions they previously had refused to answer . 
on January 15 , 1999 , the hearing before Mr. Teitelbaum took place and Mr. Justice Teitelbaum ruled on March 5 . 
he ordered CSIS to answer an additional three questions , which meant out of the original 51 questions that CSIS had refused to answer only nine of them , less than 20 % , were deemed to be valid objections . 
once again costs were awarded against CSIS . 
it is clear from the behaviour of CSIS that its main objective was to drag out the proceedings and deny me the opportunity of having this case heard in court . 
however the delaying tactics of CSIS were only part of the process . 
the content of its responses was even more troubling , which I have included in the documentation . 
in answering a question about the information the service passed to the plaintiff they neglected to mention the 107 press releases . 
CSIS also stated that it had passed the video tapes to the plaintiff in response to a request from him . 
however , as I have mentioned before , the plaintiff in discovery said that they were provided to him without his asking . 
in addition it mentioned that only one CSIS policy document was passed to the plaintiff . 
yet the very affidavit that this discovery was about lists five different CSIS policy documents . 
in other words , of the three points that CSIS made in this answer all three of them were incorrect . 
i cannot imagine , after making inquiries , that any member of a professional intelligence agency would be so incompetent that they could possibly inadvertently overlook all of this information , including the very affidavit that was being reviewed . 
the last piece of evidence that I will mention concerns the very certificate of objection that CSIS filed . 
when CSIS filed the certificate on July 7 , 1998 , the deputy director of operations , Jim Corcoran , certified that he had carefully reviewed and considered all the questions set out in that statement . 
he then certified that " the information sought by this motion , either by confirmation or denial of the said information , would be contrary to the public interest as it would be injurious to the national security of Canada '' . 
one such question was where the plaintiff refused to state during discovery whether or not it was normal that a full scale security investigation be done for people getting their security clearance renewed . 
despite the claim of CSIS that the answer to this question would be injurious to the national security of Canada , I have obtained the answer to this question from the Treasury Board ' s public website , listed under personal security standards . 
in conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I believe that I have provided you with sufficient evidence to find that there is a prima facie case of contempt against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service . 
as an opposition critic who has previously been critical of CSIS , its role in this case has effectively prevented me from raising concerns about it for three and a half years . 
in addition , CSIS has sent me and all members of the House a clear message that it is keeping track of us , watching what we do and listening to everything we say , and that it is prepared to pounce if it objects to the way in which we conduct ourselves . 
it has also shown that it is prepared to misuse the extraordinary authority that parliament has given to it to put us in an unwinnable situation . 
the premier of Quebec launched an inquiry when officials in his government improperly released information about a federal member of parliament . 
while not raised in a question of privilege it was considered wrong and an inquiry was ordered . 
the National Assembly of Quebec chose to take action against this activity , and this parliament should do the same in the case concerning CSIS . 
in my case CSIS conducted certain activities and utilized significant resources against me . 
the evidence shows that CSIS certainly took a role in orchestrating the lawsuit against me . 
as I have shown , CSIS improperly collected information and then subsequently disclosed that information to a third party in clear violation of CSIS policy . 
finally , I have shown that CSIS has misused its extraordinary authority to protect national security , that it was twice sanctioned by the federal court for misconduct , and that it deliberately misled the court to frustrate my ability to resolve the lawsuit . 
one of the basic tenets of democracy is that opposition politicians have the ability to oppose the government without fear of intimidation . 
i suggest that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has tried to introduce intimidation into Canadian politics . 
i believe it is vital that this form of intimidation is stopped immediately . 
opposition critics need to know that they can fulfil their function of criticizing a government department without fear that the department will retaliate by orchestrating a lawsuit against them . 
i therefore encourage you , Mr. Speaker , to make a precedent in this case by finding the behaviour of CSIS in this case in contempt of the House . 
i will provide the document I have here to support this claim . 
if you find that there is a prima facie case of privilege , I will move that this issue be sent to the appropriate committee for consideration . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank you for entertaining what I think is a very important question of privilege . 
what I think it comes down to is this , and it is a very important thing . 
there are a couple of important things to remember about this question of privilege . 
first , as has already been detailed by the hon. member , the question of contempt is an open - ended one . 
i can think of another very troubling case that was settled some time ago involving former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney over the airbus incident . 
i do not want to cast any idea of who is right or wrong , but what was interesting was that the government eventually had to settle for over $ 2 million to pay for the legal bills that Mr. Mulroney , because he is a wealthy man , was able to put forward in his own defence . 
how many members of parliament could have ever done that ? 
if he had been an ordinary member of parliament without those kind of deep pockets , I think Mr. Mulroney would be hanging on the ropes today instead of free and clear of that issue because he was able to fund that defence . 
that is why I think it is important that a government agency versus an ordinary member of parliament is an unequal fight and a contempt of parliament and we should see it that way . 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the solicitor general critic for the official opposition , I draw to your attention a meeting of our standing committee on May 25 with Director Alcock of CSIS . 
Mr. Speaker , if you have an opportunity to review the committee report of that session , you will find that the director exhibited the kind of culture and characteristics that have been spoken about by my colleague . 
as my colleague has pointed out , it is very important that parliamentarians are free from any sense of intimidation , in particular in the case of the meeting on May 25 . 
it was so troubling to all members of parliament , government members and all opposition members , that we subsequently held a second meeting to find out what our remedies would be in trying to get instruction to a very reluctant witness . 
in this particular case it was Director Alcock who just basically refused to respect the questions from the people in the Chamber . 
i draw that to your attention , Mr. Speaker , because I think it adds something to the picture that we are looking at here . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened with attention to the initial presentation made by the hon. member and the subsequent statements that were made . 
i do not know what they do to the seriousness of this issue . 
i am prepared to acknowledge that the accusations themselves are obviously quite serious . 
it has been alleged that CSIS offered assistance to a former employee in a civil case involving a member of parliament . 
it is alleged that this action then constitutes a question of privilege or possibly contempt or both . 
if I understood what the hon. member requested , it is that this case should be brought to the attention of a parliamentary committee for review . 
given the seriousness of these accusations , I want to remove the other materials stated by other members of parliament . 
i do not think some of them had anything to do with this issue . 
i would ask Mr. Speaker for a stay on the ruling he intends to give , whether this constitutes a prima facie case of privilege . 
i would ask that I be given a little time , and possibly other members might want to contribute toward what has been alleged today . 
in a few short hours we will have a Hansard or at least a fast version of Hansard giving us the details of what the hon. member has said . 
if I understand correctly , she has offered to table some documents with Mr. Speaker . 
if some of us could perhaps have those documents made available to us we could further contribute before Mr. Speaker makes his initial determination as to whether this constitutes a prima facie case of privilege . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , I am prepared to table this information . 
the Speaker : 
these allegations are indeed serious if the allegations are true and if I decide that we will go ahead with a prima facie case . 
i want it understood that it is not just for opposition members for whom we are talking . 
we are talking about the rights of Canadian parliamentarians specifically . 
i of course invite the hon. member to submit to me any and all documents . 
seeing that there are no more interventions at this time , I intend to review everything that has been said and everything that has been written about this particular point and I am going to give this latitude . 
i am not going to stand here on splitting a hair . 
it may be privilege or it may be contempt . 
i will decide that after I have it all laid out in front of me . 
the hon. government House leader has asked that I stay my decision . 
i have said that I would do that . 
i would entertain information if it pertains directly to what was said by the hon. member here in the House or what is in the documents which she is going to provide to me . 
i will take this information under consideration now and I will get back to the House with a decision on this case . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
at the time that the debate was interrupted the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra had five minutes remaining for questions and comments . 
there were two minutes left in the presentation and then five minutes questions and comments . 
would the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra like to proceed directly to questions and comments or take the two minutes to sum up ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I had essentially completed my remarks which were on the knowledge century in the new millennium , the 21 st century professorships . 
i had also made some brief remarks on several other matters . 
i think we could take questions at this stage if there are any questions from hon. members . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
if we do not do that , we are not going to get the opportunity to have as many members participate . 
if there is only one member standing then we will have much more latitude for the question , comment or response . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with my colleague for Brandon - Souris and I will be splitting it equally . 
there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed . 
a lot of people were waiting for this wonderful vision for the millennium and thought that was exactly what they were going to get . 
they thought that they would see things that would turn things around throughout Canada , from the east coast to the west coast . 
a lot of people were very disappointed after the throne speech came out . 
we know that the good book says , " where there is no vision the people perish '' . 
that has been the situation in Canada under the government because so many people are hurting . 
i heard one MP say that she was so pleased with the throne speech that she was going to dance in the streets . 
i have not found anyone else that wants to be her partner while she is dancing . 
she is going to dance all by herself . 
the lack of vision was truly sad . 
the one good thing that came out of the throne speech was the infrastructure program . 
having been a mayor , and many of us in the House of Commons were mayors before , I know how we fought for that infrastructure program . 
the government is saying it is going to continue the program . 
i have talked to the people from FCM and they are very pleased about that . 
i am also pleased about that . 
however , we should have been back here September 1 , not the middle of October . 
let us look at what is happening with our airline service . 
we are not sure where it is going . 
in my city of Saint John , New Brunswick , we are not sure what is going to happen . 
if we do not have airline service then what happens to the economy ? 
what happens to the people ? 
let us take a look at the other issues , the immigration issue and the illegal immigrants coming into Canada . 
no one has dealt with that very serious situation . 
let us take a look at the fishery . 
i asked those questions today in the House . 
the fisheries is a serious situation and violence can and will occur unless the Prime Minister of Canada himself steps in . 
the Prime Minister has to go to the table . 
i had aboriginal people in my office at nine o ' clock this morning . 
these are not people that live on the reserves , but the minister of fisheries has refused to meet with them . 
he and the Prime Minister have to meet and talk with them . 
i want to make sure there is a strong foundation for my two little grandchildren . 
i feel very strongly about families . 
i feel very strongly that we have to help them . 
we have to make sure that there is a strong foundation to continue to build on and assist the family unit . 
it is very important that we reduce personal income tax . 
we should be putting money back into the pockets of those parents . 
it is also very important that the transfer payments be increased so that we can have health care back where it should be . 
one would not believe the horror stories in my riding office that have happened through health care . 
we have lost in our part of Canada many of our specialists . 
we just lost another one . 
it is a major concern . 
we have to reduce our massive national debt . 
when I took over as mayor the city was in a very poor financial position , just like the country is in a very poor financial position , and I wanted to get us into a borrowing debt free position . 
i asked the commissioner of finance to give me three programs to look at to try to get us into a borrowing debt free position . 
when he put those programs before me it just so happened that on my council I had a professor at the time . 
that professor said to me " Elsie , come here to the window '' . 
i went to the window and I looked . 
we do not want to slash , burn and cut to the point that he has no way to feed his family '' . 
we did it in a very responsible way . 
this has to happen again at the federal level . 
of those men who were here on a hunger strike , one of them has been in the hospital for two operations since he went back . 
it is truly sad when we take a look at how the Liberals have cut the defence budget to the point that our troops that have to go to Croatia , Kosovo and East Timor do not have the equipment they should have . 
they must have been hurt . 
they are no longer there and the seniors are having a difficult time . 
the government needs to raise the basic income tax exemption to $ 10,000 . 
this could eliminate a lot of people from the tax rolls , more than two million lower income workers . 
the solutions rest in the strengthening of the family unit with lower taxes , with better co - operation among Ottawa , the provinces , the territories and our communities . 
we have to look at the quality of life . 
since the government came into power in 1993 it has increased personal income taxes by 15 % . 
in five years it did that . 
in five years a lot of middle income Canadians are worse off today than they have ever been . 
i know that myself . 
my daughter - in - law said to me " Mom , I find it hard these days to make ends meet '' . 
i said " I know , dear , because you are paying more in taxes than ever before '' . 
i have to say right now that things have to change , that things have to turn around . 
however , there had better be a better vision than what was contained in that throne speech if we want to turn Canada around . 
if we want to do what is right for families , if we want to do what is right for all Canadians from coast to coast , there is a lot more that needs to be done . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened closely to the member for Saint John and I think she gave a fine speech . 
i also see that she has the same health problems in her riding as we have in Quebec . 
the present federal government , led by the Liberals , has always given us to understand that only Quebec had problems with its health system , because of its sovereignist government . 
its sidekick in Quebec , the Liberal Party , has said the same thing . 
i am therefore happy to note that the member for Saint John has the same problems in her region . 
but , given the Canada - wide problems the member pointed out , I would like to know what this government , which has helped itself to provincial transfer payments , should have done right away in the throne speech , instead of promising action for 2001 or 2002 . 
i would like the member for Saint John to tell us what she would have liked to see in the throne speech that would have solved health problems in Canada . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne : 
Mr. Speaker , I would have liked to have seen money injected immediately into our health care , our educational system and transfer payments for both , along with social programs , and not in the year 2001 . 
that is two years down the road . 
we are suffering now and steps have to be taken now to correct it . 
we have to push the government to make sure that it puts that money in there before the year 2001 . 
Mr. Ren é Canuel ( Matap é dia - Matane , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have also listened to my colleague . 
she said that there was absolutely nothing for seniors . 
i say that this is scandalous , when we are in the International Year of Older Persons . 
there are other equally honourable people who cannot get on TV and they are forgotten . 
why are only a few people shown on television while others without a cent to their name are forgotten ? 
there are many seniors living in almost dire straits . 
i will let the hon. member respond to that shortly . 
reference is made to youth and children . 
in 1988 , the House of Commons voted unanimously for there to be no more poor children by the year 2000 . 
there were a million of them at that time , and today there are 1.5 million . 
that is shocking . 
a policy has been announced . 
i am not saying it is not helpful , but it is not applicable until the year 2001 . 
i am asking what the hon. member for Saint John thinks of this . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne : 
it also put carpenters , electricians and cabinetmakers to work . 
it created a good economy for us , but there is nothing for these people now . 
i have 1,000 families in Saint John , New Brunswick , that are in need of housing and there is no program at all . 
they do not want to tell me that the year 2001 is good . 
it has to be done now . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is always difficult to follow the member for Saint John . 
i will try my best to liven it up , but as I said it is somewhat difficult to match that enthusiasm . 
i am very pleased to be able to respond to the Speech from the Throne as presented by the new governor general . 
we all congratulate and welcome Adrienne Clarkson to her new post as governor general . 
i am pleased to stand in this august House to represent my constituents of Brandon - Souris . 
i certainly thank them for giving me the opportunity to represent them . 
i assure them that I will do my best to represent them to the best of my capacity . 
i will certainly pass on their concerns to the government . 
as one of the members of the government said , the throne speech was not supposed to have any substance to it but was supposed to show the vision of the government going into 21 st century . 
by the way , the government succeeded in not having any substance in that speech , but it did not succeed very well in showing the vision of the government going into the 21 st century . 
my colleague from Saint John talked about a specific area that was neglected in the throne speech , that of housing . 
i will touch on a couple of others . 
the Liberals succeeded in putting forward a very warm and fuzzy Speech from the Throne . 
that is very good and very positive . 
they touched on health care but they talked about the research requirements in health care . 
they did not really talk about where health care would be going in the next 10 , 15 or 20 years , or about what Canadians would like to see as their health care system unfolds into the 21 st century . 
this is not something that we can say is status quo . 
we have to look to the future . 
they talked about children and youth , a very important aspect of our society . 
the children we bring into this world and this country are obviously a resource and we have to look after them . 
unfortunately they did not go far enough with respect to children and youth in our society . 
the problem with Canadians today in listening to the throne speech is that they have a tendency not to believe governments any longer , in particular this government . 
the government has a history of perhaps saying things Canadians would like to hear but of perhaps not implementing them in the way Canadians feel they should be implemented . 
i do not have to go very far . 
i have to look at the scrapping of the GST which did not come to fruition . 
they were going to rip up the agreement , which is one of the major reasons the budget is now balanced . 
it is the reason the Liberal government can now take credit for something that was put into place by a government that had vision , that could look 10 and 15 years down the road and say that what is right for Canadians now is a free trade agreement so that we are a partner in the globalized trading world of today . 
if it were a Liberal government that had to put that into place , we would still be hewers of wood and drawers of water . 
the Liberals have not fulfilled any of their promises . 
Canadians today will be somewhat skeptical when they look at the throne speech that was presented two days ago . 
the Liberals talk about taxes that will be reduced . 
Canadians do not believe them because right now taxes are taking a larger portion of their pay packets than what they did previous to 1993 . 
the Liberals talked about health care and they talked about the research components of health care . 
we are going backward , not forward . 
the Liberals hold it up as being a centrepiece of their platform . 
the fact is they do not know where they are heading with health care and Canadians are concerned about that . 
i think Canadians wanted to have a good feeling as to where this government wanted to head in the future with respect to the retirement of our debt . 
our debt did not come to us immediately . 
as a matter of fact it came to us over a number of years inclusive of the Liberal government and Mr. Trudeau and inclusive of other governments . 
but there was none of that . 
what was in the throne speech was that yes , they will deal with it if they possibly can . 
that is not a plan . 
the throne speech did not talk about an area that is very close and dear to my heart and my constituency of Brandon - Souris , which by the way I think reflects society in general , an urban rural area . 
we have people who are rich and poor . 
we have people who are young and old . 
agriculture is the backbone of this country and always has been . 
i am frustrated and disappointed . 
we did not have to come up with the solutions . 
what we needed was the vision . 
a government member said " we do not deal with substance , we deal with vision '' . 
where are we going with agriculture ? 
there is no support . 
we are not supported against the Europeans and the Americans right now . 
all the government had to say is that philosophically agriculture is a very important component to this society , that it believes in a very strong , domestic supply of food for our country . 
that is all the government had to say . 
it had to say that the environment is very important and agriculture is an important part of the environment . 
it had to say that with the endangered species legislation the government talked about , it is important that we deal with agriculture and producers to make sure the endangered species legislation works . 
the government never said that . 
it never tied into it . 
that is vision and that is what is lacking in the throne speech . 
that is where we had to head with vision and that is what I did not see . 
we talk about the seniors . 
what about vision with respect to the baby boomers that are now among the seniors ? 
why do we not talk about retirement in 2010 or 2020 ? 
that is vision . 
this is a reactive government , not a proactive government . 
there was none of that . 
what was there ? 
there is no vision . 
that was lacking in the throne speech . 
a pet peeve and a soap box I like to get on is the world of work . 
work is changing all around us . 
there is contract work . 
people are now doing work in their own homes . 
there are people who are part time employees , whether they want to be or not . 
that is the vision . 
the Liberals have to put a plan in place to accommodate those people in 2000 , 2010 and 2020 . 
i am disappointed . 
what we got were warm fuzzies with no substance . 
yes , that is what the Liberals attempted to do and that is what they achieved . 
first , we do not believe the Liberals will do anything that they said they would do . 
second , it did not go far enough . 
if this is the vision of this government , if this is the direction in which this government wants to take us after January 1 , 2000 , then I am very concerned . 
our citizens are concerned . 
for the government not to have said a word about it is absolutely disgusting . 
Canadians from coast to coast needed some assurances and confidence . 
they got nothing in the throne speech and I am very concerned about our direction in the next century . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened carefully to the speech by the hon. member for Brandon - Souris . 
i would have liked him to have said what he thinks about the measure on parental leave . 
the government tells us that we need to help young families to have children , but then it organizes things in such a way that parental leave will only take effect in the year 2001 , and takes the money from the employment insurance fund . 
i would like to hear the hon. member address this point . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
Mr. Speaker , I left the parental leave to my colleague from Saint John and I thought she handled it very well . 
i have two children . 
i believe very strongly that children should have access to their parents during their formative years , particularly between one and three years of age . 
i am very proud of the way we had our children grow up and develop . 
at that time we did not have many supports from the federal government . 
if those supports are available , we will encourage it absolutely . 
we have to make sure that our children are taken care of because that is the resource we are going to depend on over the next number of years . 
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member has a vested interest in the agricultural industry and the family farm crisis being experienced throughout Canada , especially in the prairie provinces . 
he is very close to the industry in the Brandon area . 
what does the hon. member think about the concentrated control of our food and drug industry in North America and the world ? 
a handful of multinationals control the food input and output costs of the farmers and the farmers are vulnerable . 
the farmers want to be as independent as they can be , but they are at the whim of the multinationals with commodity prices , input prices , herbicides , drugs , pesticides and seed costs . 
the Liberal government seems to be very proud of this biotech division , but the farmers are being led through an evolutionary change on the family farm . 
i would like to hear the hon. member ' s comments about that . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
i go back to my comments about having an understanding as to where we want to go in agriculture . 
do we want Canadians to have a reliable domestic food supply ? 
i think that if we asked Canadians , they would say yes . 
Canadians would say yes to an affordable food supply . 
we have to talk about the multifunctionality of agriculture with respect to the environment . 
i think Canadians would say it is an important factor . 
do we want to have an independence in that sector and that industry ? 
i think Canadians would say yes . 
those are the questions the government did not ask . 
if Canadians say yes to all of those , then we have to put a philosophy together that says we will make sure that agriculture is going to exist in our country in the next 20 years and that it is going to be in family farms , as the hon. member has said . 
we have to be flexible enough to recognize that there is an evolution in agriculture , but we have to make sure that there is still an independent ownership of that agriculture , of the people who live in our communities and who want to continue to grow crops in those communities . 
we have to protect them against some of the issues the hon. member just mentioned . 
we have to protect them against some of this intrusion into their flexibility and independence . 
Mr. George Proud ( Hillsborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Guelph - Wellington . 
it is an honour for me to speak today to show my confidence in the government and the programs set out in the Governor General ' s Speech from the Throne . 
i would like to offer my humble thanks to Her Excellency Madam Clarkson for the gracious speech which she addressed to both Houses of Parliament and to all Canadians . 
there is much to talk about the millennium and what the next century holds . 
after hearing the Speech from the Throne I am certain we will enjoy a fruitful millennium , one which the Canada we know today will continue on its course of greatness in the next century and beyond , the Canada we know which looks after all citizens and creates a positive environment allowing them to maximize their potential as individuals and as collectivities . 
i could go on for days describing the wonderful state in which we live , but I am here today to show my support for our government and its plans for the coming years , its plan that will lay the foundations for generations inhabiting this great land . 
i see the Speech from the Throne as a symbol of the incredible progress we have made over the last six years . 
it is by far one of the most promising and well thought out programs I have had the pleasure to be part of . 
i would like to commend the government on its foresight . 
we are honoured to be part of a plan that takes into consideration not only the needs of middle class Canadians , but also recognizes those Canadians who may be in a less fortunate position . 
we see before us a government that is ready to commit to children and youth , to rebuilding communities , strengthening the environment , increasing disposable income through tax relief and improving our place in the world . 
we should be proud of our commitment to Canada and proud we are . 
i am also greatly pleased that so much of what our program entails is going to directly benefit my home province of Prince Edward Island . 
children are going to enter the millennium with a better education , better standard of living and a better future than has ever been seen in our history as a nation . 
new parents are going to have an edge over my generation . 
mothers and fathers alike will be able to raise a family without having to worry about the future . 
i remember a time not so long ago when the thought of raising a family in the 21 st century concerned a lot of people . 
it concerned us because under the last government we were headed toward a society where families would have been ignored . 
today we can look forward with hope . 
we can be hopeful because we are taking steps to invest in the future . 
children are the future of our nation . 
without them our liberal democratic tradition will not continue . 
they represent our legacy . 
this government will help parents spend more time caring for young children while ensuring that they have the resources to meet their children ' s needs . 
our plan will do this by reducing income taxes for families , extending employment insurance parental leave benefits and adding an additional $ 1.7 billion a year to the national child benefit making it easier for low income families to break the cycle of poverty . 
we must also invest in today ' s youth . 
they are acquiring knowledge and skills at an earlier age . 
they are at home in the wired world using tools that are rapidly changing the way we think . 
we are experiencing a technological revolution . 
when I was younger we used to use our two feet to look for a job . 
now our young adults can use the Internet to look for employment . 
they can also shop , trade stocks , say hello to a relative , all with the flick of a mouse . 
it has changed the way in which we work . 
these youth need to be given the tools to succeed under these conditions . 
our plan will give Canadian youth an edge as the technological revolution continues so that we will surpass all other nations in the world when dealing with technology ' s challenges . 
our plan will help Canada ' s youth realize their potential as leaders . 
the government will help them learn about their country and its citizens , use their skills to help others and use their creativity to contribute to Canada ' s culture . 
this will be achieved by drawing on the expertise of young Canadians to help connect rural and urban communities to the information highway by hiring our youth to put in place additional Internet access sites for public use . 
this will increase the participation of rural Canadians on the Internet while giving our youth valuable work experience . 
we will also give 100,000 young Canadians every year a chance to learn about another part of the country through exchanges Canada . 
this will solidify our youth as knowledgeable Canadians while increasing their awareness of regional issues . 
clearly technology investment is a thoughtful investment for the future of a strong Canadian federation and a strong Canadian youth . 
but all of this investment in youth , in family and children which I just spoke about is worthless if we do not have safe strong communities , communities that are free of crime , and a strong voluntary sector to tie them together . 
strong communities rely on the participation of all members . 
our government is committed to strengthen this partnership with communities and the voluntary organizations which contribute to them . 
if I may take this a step further , our investment in communities is part and parcel of our long term economic and social well - being . 
our investment in children and families is also a long term investment . 
we are however at a loss if we do not include the environment in our long term goal to enter the millennium with force . 
a clean and healthy environment is central to our quality of life and as time progresses the demands that are made on mother nature will become even more severe . 
the government recognizes this and will continue to build partnerships at home and abroad which focus on sustainable development and improve the quality of the environment in our communities . 
we will set and enforce tough pollution standards , reduce greenhouse gases , clean up contaminated sites on federal lands and support innovative clean - up technologies . 
canada has always symbolized a nation that appreciates the environment . 
as we enter the 21 st century we will continue this tradition of environmental preservation by extending Canada ' s national parks system . 
the financial stability of Canadians is also very important as we enter a new century . 
financial freedom allows Canadians to maximize their potential , gives them the freedom to grow and to put something back into the country . 
having said this , I cannot stress how important it is that we receive tax relief . 
this is the best way to give our economy a kickstart and to give the children of the future a solid foundation on which to grow . 
we cannot just provide children with a positive learning environment ; we must also give them the financial support in which to flourish . 
to give our families more disposable income so they can provide their children with the foundation to grow will certainly make Canada the place to be in the 21 st century . 
over 80 % of the responses I have received so far demand that the tax burden be reduced . 
it is clear that we must give Canadians an incentive to build . 
i look forward to our government ' s response to the overwhelming demand that exists for tax relief . 
in the Speech from the Throne Her Excellency the Governor General addressed tax relief issues . 
our government will put more dollars in the hands of families with children . 
our government will also continue to create a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden , initiating more tax cuts and making strategic investments . 
the economic spinoff from a tax cut will add to the economy . 
people who have more money at their disposal will stimulate the demand for goods and in turn will create more jobs . 
it is a win - win situation . 
i would like to join the millions of Canadians who have embraced our program . 
may we enjoy its benefits and grow as a nation as we enter the 21 st century . 
the Speech from the Throne is an ingenious formula for success . 
it contains measures that will strengthen elements of society so that as we enter the millennium we will be the best country in the world . 
let me explain this . 
our families need a dynamic economy in which to raise their children . 
we are giving them this through tax relief . 
our children need strong , safe communities in which to learn successfully . 
our government is giving them this . 
to learn successfully children need a strong health care system and our government is giving them this . 
each of these realms promotes individual development . 
our plan promotes the maximization of individuals ' potential , young and old . 
once we achieve success in every realm of individual maximization our quality of life as Canadians will improve and in turn our place in the world will improve . 
it is quite clear that we are responding positively to the daunting task of preparing Canada for the new millennium ; and yes , we are prepared . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what is amazing with this government is that it has a lot of money . 
what is even more amazing , however , is that it does not have money for this year or for the year 2000 . 
this government is suffering from the wait and see disease . 
we have to wait . 
and what about people who are waiting for the government to do something ? 
i ask my colleague opposite if he could make representations within the Liberal caucus to get the government to bring forward the implementation dates with regard to both parental leave and the infrastructure program . 
this is another ambiguous issue . 
the government says that studies will be conducted between now and the end of the year 2000 and that maybe , in the 2001 budget , it will be able to respond to the request made by municipalities . 
i ask my colleague opposite to be clearer and more precise than the Prime Minister of Canada was yesterday . 
Mr. George Proud : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for the question . 
the government has laid out a plan for the future and the next budget in February will lay out the details on the tax cuts and other issues that have been raised . 
he asked me if I would intervene . 
i am always intervening on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of all Canadians to make sure that the government does things as quickly as it can , but there are rules it has to go by and it is going by those rules . 
however , I am sure , as I have read in the headlines of the papers over the past few days , that the people in Canada are very pleased with the throne speech . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have always had a lot of respect for the hon. member for Hillsborough . 
i know he is here for the right reasons , to do the right things on behalf of his constituents . 
however , I have to admit that his speech was fairly wishy - washy , if I can use that term and it can be translated properly . 
it gives the impression of warm and fuzzy . 
i wonder if he saw the headlines about transportation , which was not mentioned in his speech , with respect to a potential monopoly situation in the air . 
i wonder if he saw the headlines with respect to the fisheries , where people are actually committing violence against one another . 
is that the type of Canada that he sees , or does he not see that through his rose coloured glasses ? 
does he not believe that it is the responsibility of his government to try to come up with solutions to those issues ? 
Mr. George Proud : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his questions . 
yes , I have seen those headlines . 
i happen to live in an area where some of those problems are taking place . 
i have confidence that the government , as it has always done , will take care of those problems . 
the member heard in question period today the question on agriculture . 
that has been taken care of . 
the question of the native and non - native fishery is a very volatile problem and I hope that cooler heads will prevail and that the government , the native fishermen and the non - native fishermen can get together to work out a solution . 
i said that we live in a great country and that things are great . 
things have never been so good , but there are still a lot of people suffering . 
that is why the government has come forward with programs to help these people , with tax cuts , with child tax benefits and with all of the things that will happen over the next couple of years . 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in today ' s debate . 
it is an important one . 
this week ' s Speech from the Throne was great news for my riding of Guelph - Wellington , and for all of Canada , quite frankly . 
it outlined a commitment to protect and improve the social programs we all hold very dear while not abandoning our commitment to fiscal responsibility . 
they said no , that the Conservatives were not on the right track . 
we refused to let this era of deficit spending continue . 
by 1998 , just five short years later , we had not only balanced the budget , we had posted a surplus of $ 3.5 billion . 
that is an improvement of $ 45.5 billion . 
it is an accomplishment of which every one of us can be proud because each Canadian helped to do that . 
obviously our balanced plan is working and we will continue to pursue that plan because it is working . 
the Speech from the Throne renews our commitment to fiscal restraint . 
we have renewed our commitment to ensuring that the nation ' s finances never get out of control again . 
we have renewed our commitment to ensuring that the debt to GDP ratio remains on a downward track . 
we have renewed our commitment to continue cutting taxes while making strategic investments in this country ' s future . 
the Speech from the Throne contains a promise to further reduce taxes . 
people in my own riding as well as many Canadians across Canada have asked for that . 
we will put more money back into the pockets of all Canadians . 
the next budget will also lay out a multi - year plan for tax reduction . 
targeted tax cuts and broad based tax cuts are both priorities in my riding . 
i have done a survey in Guelph - Wellington and that is what my constituents have told me . 
however , I also want to stress that Guelph - Wellington believes , and I know many Canadians across our great country agree , that we must not cut taxes at the expense of our valued social programs . 
that would be a serious mistake . 
when asked where new spending should be directed , my constituents identified post - secondary education as a priority . 
i am pleased to report that our government is committed to ensuring that Canada has a strong infrastructure to improve our skills , promote innovation and conduct research . 
that is great news for the University of Guelph . 
the University of Guelph is a world class , world renowned institution located in the heart of the golden technology triangle . 
it is an important part of the academic community and of our local community . 
consequently , we are all very pleased with the federal government ' s promise to increase support for granting councils , enabling them to forge new partnerships with universities and to attract more of the best research minds in the world . 
this will be done through an innovative program called 21 st century chairs for research excellence . 
we will invest $ 60 million in the first year , $ 120 million in the second year , $ 180 million in the third year . 
the program will be ongoing , with the goal of creating 12,000 positions in three years and 2,000 in the very near future . 
it is fantastic . 
the federal government also will foster greater international research collaboration by Canadian universities , and research institutes will help to expand Canadian scientific expertise in a variety of areas . 
the federal government will also work with our provincial partners to develop an action plan that sets out common principles , objectives and a funding framework for all governments to increase their resources dedicated to post - secondary education . 
together we will find ways to ensure that skills development keeps pace with the evolving economy and makes it easier to finance lifelong learning . 
for anybody who has worked in a community , we all know that lifelong learning is absolutely paramount in this economy . 
it is very important . 
the survey that I did also indicated that health care is very important and on people ' s minds . 
people want access to quality universal health care , and the factor really is a very high quality of life . 
people want that . 
our health care system represents our society ' s belief in compassion and in caring . 
many times we hear the Reform Party talk about the United States and how wonderful the United States is . 
over the next two years we will support our partners in testing innovations in home care and pharmacare and integrated service delivery , then consider what further significant investments need to be made . 
we will also build a modern health system to make health information more accessible , not only to health professionals but also to citizens like you , Mr. Speaker , and I. 
more and more we are learning that the quality of our health is affected by the state of our environment . 
Canadians have long recognized that a clean and healthy environment is essential to maintaining and enhancing our quality of life . 
Guelph - Wellington is known for its environmentally friendly practices , such as its state of the art wet and dry recycling facility . 
just recently we had five members of parliament in attendance at an event held at the recycling plant . 
this was really a great show of support from the government for recycling and environmental issues . 
i believe other communities can and will learn from our example , especially given the federal government ' s commitment to further developing and adopting green technology . 
a clean and healthy environment is a wonderful legacy for our children . 
children are our future and Guelph - Wellington believes that they deserve the best possible start in life . 
on this issue once again the Speech from the Throne reflects the priorities of my constituents . 
the 1999 throne speech includes the commitment to help families by cutting taxes and leaving more money in their pockets . 
the federal government will also increase funding for the national child benefit by 2002 , further helping parents to provide for their children . 
we will lengthen employment insurance benefits for parental leave . 
children always come first with the government . 
in a recent survey my people identified health care , post - secondary education , tax cuts , the environment and the future of our children . 
the throne speech has all of these elements . 
the Prime Minister of Canada has listened to the people of Guelph - Wellington again . 
the throne speech lays out our path as we enter a new century and a new millennium . 
the initiatives it outlines will help us to maintain a dynamic economy , strengthen our communities and further advance Canada ' s place in the world . 
i know that the future holds many wonderful things for Canada . 
with the guidance of the federal government , we will work together and achieve our goals . 
the world has seen the future and it is Canada '' . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
since the government took office , the environment has gone from the sixth largest department to the twenty - first largest department in government . 
this is also a government that waited six years to pass its first environmental piece of legislation since taking office , the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , Bill C - 32 , which was not exactly a watershed bill . 
as the House knows , the environmental members of the Liberal caucus , those very learned members in terms of the members for Lac - Saint - Louis and York North , all expressed concerns on that piece of legislation . 
my question is very simple . 
does the hon. member think one piece of legislation passed in six years is a watershed leadership on environmental legislation ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
many communities have studied our recycling wet - dry facility and many areas are following our example . 
the federal government has just put a huge amount of money into that so that all communities can learn . 
the government has been doing this consistently . 
it has been going across Canada and putting money into projects that really do work and really make a difference in all of our lives on a daily basis . 
in the end this will benefit all of us and will leave a legacy for our children that we can all be proud of . 
Mr. Ren é Canuel ( Matap é dia - Matane , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member would have us believe that there are no problems in Canada or almost none . 
he keeps repeating that like a parrot . 
it is not necessarily true . 
how is it that the government is offering so little , and nothing before the year 2001 ? 
between now and then , what is it offering children ? 
what is it offering the many teenagers across Canada who take their own lives because there are problems ? 
we must not bury our heads in the sand . 
the truth must be told . 
there are a lot of problems in Canada but the government prefers not to see them , because that is less painful . 
what will be done between now and the year 2001 since most programs will kick in only after 2001 ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member from Quebec said that we need to spell out the truth . 
he is indeed quite right . 
we do need to spell out the truth . 
we have a party across the way , the Bloc Quebecois , that wants to break this beautiful country up . 
it is disgraceful because the reality is that we do live in the best country in the world . 
we have been named six times as the best country in the world . 
as President Clinton said when he was here , I do not know of any country where people can get along better by being on their own and breaking a country up . 
when Quebec needed help who helped it ? 
every province from across Canada helped Quebec and it was happy to take that help . 
the Bloc members should be ashamed of themselves . 
do they want to hear the truth ? 
they should be proud Canadians and proud to live in this great land of ours . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wanted to rebut the $ 42 billion but I will pass on that . 
the member for Guelph - Wellington mentioned that she had five Liberal MPs in her riding recently . 
why could she not bring her colleagues down to see that in her rosy little world ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
Mr. Speaker , I will invite my colleagues to go to my hon. colleague ' s riding . 
i know there are serious problems in Canada , but there is no question that we live in the greatest country in the world , bar none . 
the reality is that the Liberal government will continue on a path of trying very hard to make sure social problems are addressed and that we are financially and fiscally responsible . 
we pledge to that . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
the reason I want to address that issue again is that the intentions of my suggestion have been repeatedly misinterpreted not only by the government but also by opposition members on this side of the House , both Conservative and NDP . 
it is sad that has happened because the reality is that if we do not go back to the court , if we continue on the path that the minister has taken , the minister will be sitting at the table with no cards in his hands and no chips on the table . 
the fact is that the decision by the court has taken away the minister ' s bargaining position . 
he has nothing to negotiate . 
the court has very clearly allowed a native preference and a native priority to fish as a result of this Marshall decision . 
the court has very clearly stated that . 
it has also not imposed any limits on it . 
the court has again said that natives have the right to fish and earn a moderate living . 
the minister has in fact made matters worse by suggesting that he will allow that right and recognize it as a communal right . 
the reality is then that rather than a fisher going out and earning a moderate living from that fishery , it could very well be expected that moderate living could apply to all the Mi ' kmaq in the maritimes , all 12,000 and some - odd of them . 
if one out of four of those Mi ' kmaq decides to exercise the right that the court has granted , there will be no room at all for anyone else in that fishery . 
that is the pure , hard , cold facts of the matter . 
the disappointment I had with the debate last night was that nobody seemed to be speaking for the current participants in this fishery . 
nobody in the House was addressing a concern about those people . 
an hon. member : 
you did . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
my colleague says I did . 
yes , I did , but it seemed that I was a voice in the wilderness in this place . 
it is going to take more than just saying so . 
it is going to take convincing the minister to go back to the court to seek a stay of judgment . 
the reason for that is quite simple . 
if he goes back and seeks that stay of judgment , it is going to give him some bargaining chips . 
he will have something on the table in front of him that will allow him to negotiate from a position of strength . 
as it is now , he has nothing . 
the courts have given the proverbial ranch away . 
the question is : how outrageous is this request to seek a stay of judgment ? 
is it somehow trying to avoid the decision ? 
is it somehow trying to work around the decision and avoid it ? 
no , it is not . 
the stay of judgment is asking the court to back off to allow for a cooling off period . 
it is asking the court to define its intentions with regard to , for example , a moderate livelihood , and to define or clarify whether non - status natives are going to be covered by this decision . 
this would give some guidelines for the minister to take to the negotiating table . 
this would allow the minister to bargain from a position of knowledge . 
if no effort is made to define the rights of non - status natives , if there is no effort made to define whether or not the courts were including them as people to be covered by this treaty , it is best to know that now because as sure as the Lord made little green apples that matter will end up in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
if it is not done now at the request of the minister , it will be done two or three years from now . It will be there . 
we could have two or three years of negotiation with the Mi ' kmaq people to try to find a place for non - aboriginal fishermen in the newly mandated fishery , and after two or three years of debate find all of that tossed out the window because all of a sudden we have about another some 36,000 non - status natives at the table as well saying that they too have a priority right to fish as a result of this treaty . 
it is critical that a decision is made to go back to the court . 
that decision has to be made within the next three days , because the government had 30 days from the time the decision came down to ask for a stay of proceedings and for this redefinition . 
if the government allows that time to go by without making application , it has lost it . 
there is nothing on the table . 
the minister has given it up . 
he has walked away . 
he has turned his back on fishermen in the maritimes . 
it is as simple as that . 
why my request would be denied by the NDP and by the Conservatives is beyond me . 
why they would deny strengthening the minister ' s hand so he could clarify the situation that is before us , so he could determine the level of participation of non - aboriginal fishermen in this fishery , is beyond me . 
why would they deny guaranteeing non - aboriginal fishermen access to this fishery ? 
as I said , there is no guarantee now that there will be room for non - aboriginal fishermen if this decision goes unchallenged . 
clearly the Mi ' kmaq could use up the total access that we now have to the resource . 
there is no question at all that they have a priority right to that fish and could very well utilize the total allowable catch we now have . 
i would like to apply that consideration to the decision the supreme court reached in the Marshall case . 
that information should be presented to the court when we ask for this stay , because I do not think it was the intention of the court to create this separate but equal fishery . 
if we look at the Gladstone decision of the Supreme Court of Canada , that decision gave the Heiltsuk band of the central coast of British Columbia the right to fish herring roe on kelp . 
it said they had an inherent right to fish herring roe on kelp , but at the same time it acknowledged that others had also acquired rights . 
if the government went back to the court it would acknowledge that others have rights . 
i would advise the government to seek that balance and perhaps some give some guidance on how that balance could be achieved . 
unless the government seeks the stay , I do not think we will have the benefit of that advice from the courts . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the remarks of the member because I too am deeply troubled by the supreme court decision in the Marshall case . 
i do not agree with him however that we should seek a stay and go back to the courts for interpretation . 
i suggest to the hon. member that the courts have already done enough damage with their decisions . 
to leave it to the courts to determine what a moderate livelihood is would be like a game of Russian roulette . 
i am afraid parliament and both sides of the dispute will be the ones who will suffer from it . 
i address my remark to the member . 
my own feeling is that surely the better way to approach this problem is for parliament , through its elected government and through the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , to put his own interpretation on moderate livelihood and apply that interpretation . 
that court decision is so vague . 
as somebody who has spent my life in words , I find that the judges have actually put words into a treaty that did not exist and used that as a basis for an interpretation . 
it really reduces this place to insignificance when courts can apply judgments to laws that we have not created , as they have done in this case with the British treaty of 1760 . 
i ask the member , if it were a choice , is it not better for the government to act swiftly and unilaterally and do its own interpretation ? 
Mr. John Cummins : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments of the member opposite . 
yes , it would be beneficial if the government could act unilaterally and fix this problem . 
unfortunately it cannot . 
the supreme court has stated what the law of the land is , and the law of the land gives the Mi ' kmaq a priority right to commercial fish . 
the only right the minister has to interfere is the right to interfere in the interest of conservation . 
that is the only way he can interfere in this matter . 
the court looked at the current regulations in place and struck them down . 
it said that those regulations interfered with the treaty right and therefore they had no place . 
what is interesting is that we arrived at this situation not unwittingly . 
the information that we present to the court enables the court to make decisions . 
it will make a decision in our favour against it , if we want to look at in those terms , but if we do not give the court the information we are at its mercy . 
not only must we give them the information , but we have to be careful if we make any concessions . 
the government made two critical concessions when it argued this case before the supreme court . 
in the first one the crown ' s expert witness described the prohibition on Mi ' kmaq trading with others and the restriction that they only trade at truck houses . 
the crown ' s expert witness allowed that that could be interpreted by the courts as somehow a right to trade . 
it was anything but a right to trade . 
it was a restriction on a trading right , but the crown allowed that restriction on a trading right could be interpreted as a right to trade . 
the second mistake the crown made was that this treaty did not mention fish as a trading item . 
fish had no value as a trading item and was readily available to anybody . 
yet the crown allowed and the government allowed that fish could be included as a trading commodity . 
from a restriction on trading , from a treaty in which fish was not mentioned at all , we arrived at a place where preferential right to fish has been given . 
we have a very difficult situation . 
it is easy to criticize the supreme court and I have done it because it deserves to give this situation the sober second thought that it did not get by the government . 
there are other issues the government did not mention that are worth mentioning . 
since the signing of the Magna Carta in British common law there has existed something called the public right to fish . 
that public right to fish was in operation at the time this treaty was signed . 
this treaty ignored that public right . 
that should have been brought to the attention of the government because there was nothing done when this treaty was signed to revoke the public right . 
the government should have brought that to the court ' s attention . 
it did not and that has been allowed to stand since that time . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak in response to the throne speech on the issue of immigration . 
immigration issues were some of the issues that were in the forefront . 
certainly they were issues that were most important to Canadians over this past summer . 
there was not even a broad statement in the throne speech on what the government intends to do with immigration . 
twenty per cent of Canadians see immigration as the most important issue to them , up from 3 % in the last poll that Angus Reid did . 
i believe the reason for this is that Canadians have recognized the government ' s bungling in terms of dealing with the issue of illegal migrants over this past summer , in particular illegal migrants coming by boat , although certainly at the airports and borders as well . 
only 5 % to 10 % of all people who come illegally to our country come by boat . 
the rest come through the airports or across the borders . 
Canadians have finally recognized that our government losing control over people coming into the county is a real threat to national security . 
it is a true threat to national security . 
i believe this issue has moved up to occupy second place when it comes to issues of importance to Canadians . 
if we look at cities like Vancouver and Toronto , immigration right now is by far the most important issue to people in those cities . 
it is an issue which the government completely ignored despite having 41 of 43 seats in the greater Toronto area and having seats in the Vancouver area . 
i think it is really shameful neglect . 
our immigration system today is dysfunctional , not only in terms of dealing with people coming into the country illegally but also in terms of dealing with those that we want to attract through our immigration system the people who are designated as people Canada wants to attract by the immigration department . 
our system is completely dysfunctional when it comes to those people we want to attract and that is what I intend to talk about today . 
i want to start with the government ' s handling of the whole issue of illegal migration over the summer . 
with this summer ' s arrival of illegal migrants by boat , about 600 , which represents only 5 % to 10 % of illegal migration , what was the government ' s response ? 
after prodding from the official opposition and from Canadians across the country the minister said " I am going to expedite the system . 
i am going to make it so that the people coming by boat illegally will have a hearing within six to seven months rather than the eleven month average we have now '' . 
that is only the initial hearing . 
it has nothing to do with appeals . 
we have seen appeals lasting for years and years . 
it is not that uncommon any more . 
the government ' s response was to expedite the process . 
that process has been expedited so much that as of last week out of the roughly 600 people who came by boat only 4 have gone through the process . 
i am talking about just the initial hearing . 
we have had no appeals so far . 
what is the significance of this system taking so long ? 
the significance is certainly high to Canadians generally , and to those who have had their lives put into limbo through this process that is so dreadfully slow . 
we have people who have come to this country believing in many cases that they are coming to establish a new life . 
certainly they know that they are using illegal means to get here in most cases , but they do not understand that they will be led into a life of servitude , that they will be a part of a virtual slave trade , the new slave trade . 
for this to be happening is shameful . 
we will look back in history 30 or 40 years from now and wonder how Canada could have been so negligent in handling this situation . 
the people who have come will have their lives put on hold for months and years , and then many will be deported back to their countries of origin . 
what will be left for them two or three years down the road ? 
i would suggest very little . 
in the meantime , what about Canadian taxpayers ? 
they are footing the bill for this system that is not functioning well at all . 
they are paying millions and millions of dollars because the process is so slow and so flawed . 
it is shameful . 
by ignoring this in the throne speech the government has demonstrated that it is just not willing to deal with tough issues such as this . 
i think we need a government that will show some leadership . 
what we proposed over the summer , and in fact over the past six years , is that first we should detain all people coming to this country until their hearings , but that the hearings be held within days or weeks rather than months or years as is now commonly the case . 
then , once a determination has been made , it should be acted upon . 
that is what we have called for . 
yesterday in the House the minister said that Canada has some of the toughest laws on this issue . 
i do not know what she was comparing us with , because in fact we have extremely weak laws in terms of dealing with people smugglers when compared with the United States , Australia or other countries . 
not only that , the maximum 10 year sentence has never been implemented . 
the maximum sentence that has ever been imposed on someone involved in people smuggling in this country is somewhere around three years . 
that is completely unacceptable and it clearly demonstrates a lack of leadership by this government . 
i would like to speak next about this system not working for the people for whom it is intended to work . 
there are three streams of immigration . 
the first stream is the independent category , which is made up of people who come because they have special education or special skills , or because they are going to invest in a business or operate a business . 
the second stream is the refugee stream . 
most experts would suggest that through our refugee stream probably 60 % are bogus refugees . 
they are not legitimate refugees as laid out in the UN convention on refugees . 
the third stream is family reunification of both of these previous groups . 
i would ask if any member of the House could honestly say that they do not have a huge problem in their constituency when it comes to processing people whom we desperately need in this country , those people who bring a special skill or education , or reuniting them with their families from their countries of origin , or reuniting a Canadian with someone they have recently married . 
i know that not one member of the House would say honestly that the system is not so badly broken that it is not working for these very people for whom it is intended to work . 
not only is the system not working for those it is intended to work for , it has been a disaster in terms of screening people for whom it is not intended to work . 
it should be clear to Canadians that we need leadership on this issue . 
we are not getting it from the government . 
i implore the government to deal with this issue . 
if it will not , and I assume it will not - it has shown no will to do that - then we will when we form the government in two years . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to reassure the member for Lakeland that there are those on this side of the House who share some of the views he has just expressed about the urgency of coming to grips with the problem of the migrants on the west coast . 
in my six years in the House I think I have only once heard a suggestion from the Reform Party that I fully agreed with and that was the suggestion that the migrants should be detained until their cases are disposed of and it is determined whether they are refugees or not . 
this seems like a harsh thing to do . 
we are actually keeping people confined , as they would be in any kind of detention , which is a type of jail . 
the alternative is too much to even contemplate . 
what we are really dealing with is trafficking in human beings . 
so long as these people are released back into the community - and I know the Department of Immigration has already experienced this - they are immediately drawn into absolute slavery . 
the condition of their passage is to work it off in one manner or another . 
in that sense I think the hon. member is entirely correct , even though the prospect of detaining people is very unpalatable to anyone who wants to give people the benefit of the doubt and freedom in the process thereof . 
i wonder if the member would comment on that . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit : 
Mr. Speaker , the member has hit on a key point . 
the Singh decision and other decisions have said that those who arrive at our borders or even in territorial waters are entitled to the full set of rights that a citizen would be entitled to . 
i believe that decision does have and impact on this situation . 
however , I believe that even with those restrictions in place , this government , if it had the will , could speed up the process to the point that it could process people coming illegally in days or weeks rather than months or years as is now the case . 
then detention is not such a big issue . 
people then are detained for days or weeks . 
if they choose to appeal it could be longer , but we could speed up the appeals process rather than detaining them for months or years . 
therefore we deal with both problems . 
we also deal with sending the message to those involved in people smuggling that if they want to make money smuggling people into Canada they are no longer going to be able to do it because , by gosh , Canada deals with these situations quickly , firmly and we act on the hearings while still respecting the UN convention on refugees . 
i believe we can respect the UN convention on refugees fully . 
i believe we can get around the Singh decision , which I believe was a very bad decision , and the other decisions and speed up the process to the point that it will work quite well . 
let us give control over policy issues back to the government . 
the government could take it back . 
it would be rare that it would involve invoking the notwithstanding clause . 
it just takes the will on the part of government . 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a great pleasure to see you in the chair . 
the new session has started well with you gracing our presence . 
i am also happy to have the opportunity to take part in the debate on the Speech from the Throne , a speech which was read by our new Governor General , Her Excellency Madam Clarkson , on Tuesday . 
i join with all members of the House , and of course with yourself , Mr. Speaker , in congratulating her on her new role and in wishing her the very best in the years ahead as Her Majesty ' s representative in Canada . 
since I have also been given a new role in the federal cabinet , I am pleased to take part in this debate and to have the chance to talk about an issue that I have been connected with all my life , that of protecting the environment . 
as we heard in the throne speech , Canadians understand very well that the high quality of life we enjoy in this country , as well as our health and the health of future generations , depends on a clean and safe environment . 
Canadians also understand that the quality of our environment is closely linked to that of the world environment . 
they understand clearly that any progress in this area requires initiatives to be taken on both the national and the international level . 
the Liberal government intends to make environmental issues central to Canadian public life in coming weeks and months . 
to that end , we are going to take action on a number of different fronts , and to step up our environmental protection measures . 
as I am sure hon. members fully appreciate , the Government of Canada does not have jurisdiction over all environmental and species protection issues in this country . 
that is why we will be working in close , harmonious partnership with provincial governments , municipalities , first nations , the academic community , the business community , environmental groups and , of course , individual Canadians who are concerned . 
we no longer have the luxury of pretending that environmental questions amount to a zero sum game of jurisdictional tradeoffs , a game where a win for the environment is somehow a loss for business , or a win for business is a loss for the environment , or a win for the provinces is a loss for the federal government and so on . 
we must reinforce the fact that a clean environment , human health and a strong economy go hand in hand and that we must work together to achieve those common goals . 
therefore , I will be working closely with my provincial counterparts because in many areas we share responsibility for protecting the environment . 
i believe that provincial action can be influenced by the federal government even in situations beyond our strict constitutional jurisdiction . 
with respect to species protection , for example , there is a long history of co - operation among the federal , provincial and territorial governments through such things as the designation of protected areas , implementing international wildlife agreements and a commitment to biodiversity . 
in 1996 , some three years ago , wildlife ministers agreed to the accord for the protection of species at risk . 
i am pleased , in fact I am delighted , that all governments in this country have agreed that any species protection legislation must include provisions for the protection of the critical habitat of endangered species . 
this is absolutely fundamental : no habitat , no species . 
we are now working under that accord with our provincial colleagues to develop stewardship programs and other collaborative and voluntary measures to protect species at risk . 
one such program is the Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Foundation which is close to my home on Vancouver Island . 
environment Canada is working with the B.C. Ministry of the Environment , Lands and Parks , B.C. Hydro , MacMillan Bloedel , the forestry company , the World Wildlife Fund , the Toronto and Calgary zoos and many others to try to save one of this country ' s most endangered species from extinction . 
i believe the Vancouver Island marmot is North America ' s most endangered mammal . 
the federal legislation to protect species at risk mentioned in the Speech from the Throne will complement and strengthen provincial legislation with programs and voluntary initiatives . 
the federal approach aims to build on the excellent efforts to protect endangered species which are already being made and measures already being taken by so many individuals and groups . 
i salute them . 
the only sustainable way to preserve species and their habitats is to ensure that appropriate incentives and knowledge are available to encourage each Canadian to do the right and responsible thing . 
we expect this to work in the vast majority of cases but when it does not , prohibitions must be available to prevent extinction and critical habitat destruction . 
we are also working to protect our water resources . 
protecting Canada ' s fresh water is not a question of economics or trade ; it is a question of ecology . 
water is vital to human health , for our ecosystems , agriculture and industry . 
canada ' s sovereignty over its water resources is total . 
water in its natural state is not a commodity , and therefore not covered by NAFTA . 
in order to ensure an enforceable Canada wide solution using an ecosystem approach , we are working jointly on an agreement under the terms of which each jurisdictional area would establish laws , regulations or policies prohibiting the removal of large quantities of water from Canadian water basins , including for export . 
that includes federal legislative measures through amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act . 
they will be introduced this fall and will give the federal government the legislative authority to prohibit the removal of large quantities of water from bodies of boundaries water , such as the Great Lakes . 
we have also made a request with the United States to have the International Joint Commission study how water consumption removals and diversions could affect our Great Lakes . 
our objective here is not to plan for removal but to provide a basis for ensuring a consistent management regime for water shared with the United States . 
Mr. Speaker , I know that your riding is at the end of the Great Lakes and the beginning of the St. Lawrence River . 
i am pleased to report to you that the interim report of the commission which was released in August supports our strategy and agrees that removals are harmful to the ecosystems that they support . 
the report recommends an immediate moratorium on bulk water removals until the full report is completed , which we expect to be early next year . 
the commission is consulting widely with Great Lakes communities through public meetings which are currently under way . 
Canadians are especially concerned about air quality . 
residents in many areas are subjected to unacceptable air pollution caused by ground level ozone and airborne particles which combine with other air pollutants to produce smog . 
that is particularly so in our urban centres . 
we have taken several measures to reduce smog over the last few years but I have to say a great deal remains to be done . 
for example , measures are now being taken to reduce the level of sulphur in gasoline . 
we want to reduce those levels by 90 % by 2005 . 
why ? 
because the health benefits alone will be of enormous benefit to Canadians . 
an independent panel of health and environmental experts predicts that a reduction to that level would prevent some 2,100 premature deaths , 92,000 incidents of bronchitis in children , five million other health related incidents such as asthma attacks , and eleven million acute respiratory symptoms , such as severe coughs and new cases of pneumonia and croup . 
that would be over a 20 year period . 
with those figures I wonder whether anyone could argue that those steps should not be taken to protect the health of Canadians . 
i do not think many would . 
it also gives me satisfaction to be able to note that the government is determined to work with provincial governments and other levels of government to improve the country ' s physical infrastructure in the coming century . 
we must ensure that our increased trade and our improved economy are matched by an increased capacity to move people and things in complete safety . 
in order to maintain the quality of life in our cities and rural communities , we must ensure our air and water are clean . 
this agreement will set out shared principles , objectives and fiscal parameters for all partners to increase their resources directed toward infrastructure , with a particular focus on the environment , as well as health and safety , transportation , tourism , telecommunications and culture . 
i would like to describe this program that we will be developing as a green infrastructure program because I am sure that when we examine the needs of this country that in fact is the way it will be . 
i would like to say a word about contaminated sites . 
we will be dealing with the clean - up of contaminated sites and how we can improve our performance in that area . 
that again was mentioned in Her Excellency ' s speech . 
i must warn Canadians that this will be a long term program . 
we have had , as reported by the environment commissioner , starts and stops before . 
i want to see a clear outline , a program , to achieve substantial clean - up of our contaminated sites over the next 20 years . 
recently we have committed some $ 38 million to the clean - up of the Sydney tar ponds which is Canada ' s most contaminated site . 
of course more will be required on the financial side and more will have to be done . 
there are literally thousands of contaminated sites which are under federal jurisdiction , thousands more under provincial jurisdiction and many which we describe as orphan sites where there is an abandoned mine and there is no possibility of finding an organization which will pick up the clean - up costs . 
the tar ponds remind us of why we must change our approach to the environment . 
we need to prevent pollution before it occurs rather than paying the enormous costs which sometimes result from clean - up after the fact . 
that is why we must be more diligent in conducting our environmental assessments . 
it is why we have made pollution prevention the cornerstone of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , or CEPA . 
the renewed CEPA provides the government with stronger powers to protect the environment and therefore human health . 
essentially it marks a shift from after the fact clean - up to proactive prevention . 
after investing a very lengthy period of more than five years in renewing this legislation , I believe we can now move forward on implementing stronger environmental protection to give Canadians the cleaner environment that they deserve . 
i announced two or three weeks ago that $ 72 million would be put forward in new funding to strengthen our scientific and enforcement capacity under the new CEPA . 
this is in addition to the $ 40 million that was announced earlier this year to conduct scientific research into toxic substances that harm human health and the environment , including endocrine disrupters , the so - called gender benders and toxics that may have serious effects on all species , including the human species . 
under the act , all substances currently used in Canada will be examined for their level of toxicity . 
as well , the act provides firm deadlines for the control of toxic products and requires the virtual elimination of the most dangerous ones . 
the act gives Environment Canada officials significant new powers to act with respect to a polluter breaking the law . 
it will also help Canada honour a number of international environmental commitments and enable people to initiate proceedings if the federal government does not ensure compliance with the law . 
the act includes new provisions for regulating vehicles and fuels and new abilities to regulate less traditional sources of air pollution such as lawn mowers and off - road vehicles . 
the government has already begun discussions with manufacturers of these devices so as to reduce toxic emissions and greenhouse gases . 
we are committed to clean air . 
we are prepared to take the action necessary to prevent the build - up of greenhouse gases that are responsible in part for climate change . 
this may eventually mean some changes in lifestyle choices for many Canadians , but I am confident that Canadians understand there will be even greater adverse lifestyle changes if we do not take action at the present time on this problem . 
on climate change , in 1997 Canada joined with 160 other nations in negotiating the Kyoto protocol on climate change . 
we set a target of reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to 6 % below the 1990 levels . 
the fact that other countries have agreed to comparable reduction targets does not make the 6 % reduction any less ambitious or challenging for an energy dependent country such as Canada . 
to meet these targets , given the projected growth in our economy and population , we will have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 25 % below the business as usual projected levels for 2010 . 
those targets cannot be reached without significant changes to the way our economy functions and to our lives as individuals . 
the most credible evidence that we have available tells us that climate change due to human activity is a reality . 
i could give more on climate change . 
i have many pages in my speech explaining the problem and giving examples of it . 
i will simply say that I will be happy to discuss this with the member over lunch some time . 
i am sure the member agrees it is important to make sure we have a system that is acceptable to Canadians which achieves the goals in question . 
many opportunities will be provided by our environmental programs such as developing new environmental technologies . 
the opportunities for export , et cetera , are there . 
therefore we have many provisions which again could be mentioned , but I will pass over them quickly and simply say that we will find economic opportunities which will flow from our efforts to improve the environment in Canada . 
in conclusion , Canadians understand the linkages between the environment and health and between environment and economic growth . 
they understand that we need to have development and growth . 
that has to be sustainable in the future . 
they also understand that we must act decisively or in essence we will be guilty of robbing our children and grandchildren of a safe , secure and prosperous future . 
i am sure all members of the House will actively support our actions in this regard . 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this minister and his B.C. Liberal sidekicks have shown very little regard for the problems and rights of the vast majority of B.C. citizens . 
first , there is the expropriation of the provincial land at Nanoose Bay in the face of incredible opposition , something never done before in Canadian history . 
second , there is the lack of protection of B.C. ' s children by their appalling inaction on the court ' s decision on child pornography . 
third , and I address this to the former minister of fisheries , over a period of time they have failed to effectively solve the problem of the preservation of the salmon stocks on the west coast and have downsized the fleet so that hundreds of fishermen and their families are bankrupt . 
fourth , there has been inaction on closing the loopholes on Canada ' s immigration laws that saw hundreds of illegal immigrants come to the shores of Vancouver Island this summer . 
fifth , there is a total lack of compassion for non - native residents on Musqueam lands who will soon be kicked out of there homes . 
i can go on and on , but I think that is enough . 
why should the people of B.C. have any confidence in the Liberal promises made in the throne speech when they have that appalling record before them ? 
hon. David Anderson : 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the hon. member that in poll after poll the Liberal Party in British Columbia receives double the support of his party . 
if these issues are so important to the people of British Columbia as he has described them , he should recognize the people of British Columbia recognized that the balanced approach of the government to improve expenditures on health care and on the social side , the reduction in taxes and in debt , is the appropriate way for Canada to go , and that this is very beneficial to British Columbia . 
were he correct , his party might perhaps have more support than it currently does . 
he is a member of a party whose own leader thinks the party should disintegrate and disappear . 
poll after poll in the last many months have shown our support to be double that of Reform . 
clearly he is continuing to put the Reform Party ahead of the interests of British Columbia . 
that is why he and his friends are so consistently rejected by the people of British Columbia . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened very closely to the new Minister of the Environment . 
for his part , the minister says he is going to consult so as not to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
the minister also tells us he is going to take action immediately . 
right now , Canada is flying in the face of everything other countries are doing . 
it wants to put more energy into getting nuclear power plants to burn plutonium . 
i would like to know where the Minister of the Environment stands on this , and if all Canadians and parliamentarians will have a say before Canada makes a decision on this issue . 
hon. David Anderson : 
Mr. Speaker , first I thank the hon. member for Jonqui è re for her questions . 
her first question was about co - operation between the federal and provincial governments . 
i can assure the hon. member that I have already had meetings with provincial ministers . 
we have had very productive discussions on endangered species . 
we all shared the same views , as I mentioned in my speech . 
we set the objectives three years ago . 
the purpose of the meetings held a few weeks ago was to discuss ways to achieve the goals that we set together . 
there is truly a great deal of co - operation between the various levels of government , because we know that Canadians want us to take action . 
the second thing that she mentioned was the issue of the very small amount of weapons grade plutonium , the MOx which is to be burned in the Chalk River reactor . 
the reason this is important is that the world has literally tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that are rusting in former soviet union territories and need to be disposed of , to be eliminated . 
we have to take risks . 
it is true that she is correct . 
there can be very minor risks related to transportation , but if we are not willing to take the small risk to achieve a much greater gain for society our children and grandchildren will know that we have failed because we simply are delaying a problem to them . 
this is a very important issue . 
it is truly an example of the biblical injunction to beat the swords into ploughshares , to destroy weapons for good . 
can we think of anything more symbolic of turning evil into good than turning these weapons of mass destruction into light and power for human use ? 
is there anything more symbolic of the type of thing we should be doing ? 
yes , I admit to the member that there are risks , but I challenge her to think also of the risks of doing nothing . 
the worst thing we can commit as legislators is to simply say there is a problem and do nothing , leave it alone , ignore it , let our children have the problem and inherit something much worse than if we dealt with it now . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
i know he referred to this in his speech but perhaps he could clarify it . 
just what is the government ' s intention with respect to how it plans to live up to the motion passed in the House in February this year having to do with the government placing an immediate moratorium on the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers and , according to the motion , introducing legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater exports and interbasin transfers ? 
the motion that was passed called for a national ban on the bulk export of water . 
i asked the government House leader today under House business whether there was legislation forthcoming . 
he said as far as he knew there was . 
i would like to ask the minister if he could clarify just what we can expect in this regard by way of national legislation , a national ban , because as he knows the provinces , particularly Newfoundland of late - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt . 
the hon. the minister will have about a minute to respond . 
hon. David Anderson : 
Mr. Speaker , once again I thank the hon. member for an excellent question . 
i will go a lot further than he proposes . 
we will be having a meeting of provincial ministers and myself , because as I mentioned to the hon. member for Jonqui è re we believe in the importance of co - operation in this regard and many aspects of control of water are provincial . 
we will move together with them through the accord . 
as the hon. member has correctly mentioned , in the last few days Newfoundland has come on board of the accord concept for the elimination of exports . 
we are delighted with that . 
in addition , I am going further by discussing with them not just the elimination of exports of bulk water . 
i should distinguish between bulk water exports and containers of water , which are a different matter . 
in addition , we do not believe there should be any major diversions from watershed to watershed whether or not they cross international boundaries . 
we will be discussing with the provinces an accord which essentially lives up to the International Joint Commission report of the Great Lakes area but in addition deals with the issue of interbasin transfers for water beyond just exports . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
it is seldom that we are able to have some time to question a minister regarding some of these issues . 
as incompetent as some of them are , I am sure that all of us would agree to another 10 minutes of questioning of the minister with agreement from the House . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. the member for Wild Rose has requested the unanimous consent of the House to extend the period provided for questions and comments by 10 minutes . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a good thing that we have an opportunity to discuss the throne speech delivered earlier this week and entitled " Building a higher quality of life for all Canadians '' . 
when I look at that title , certain questions come to mind . 
of course , since I take a particular interest in the agri - food sector , I must tell you that I have the distinct feeling that agriculture was completely left out in this speech . 
one would need a magnifying glass or would have to be an expert at criscross puzzles to find something that applies directly to agriculture . 
these difficulties are also caused by a drop in prices , which are unstable or low for agricultural commodities , both animal and vegetable , as well as by natural disasters . 
this brings me to the issue of the crisis Canadian agriculture is facing today . 
one just has to look at the numerous releases that were sent to us over the last year to understand what I am talking about . 
we saw all kinds of changes being made to the program , all kinds of adjustments to try to make it acceptable to farmers . 
but I wonder if government officials sat down with a farm family to see how these people can fill out these kinds of forms . 
some of the farmers who spoke to me of their distress told me that filling out the form can cost them $ 1,000 or so in accountants ' fees , because an accountant is needed . 
the farm ' s taxation year is not the year in which the products are sold . 
there are therefore two kinds of figures and generally a person who is very busy and used to doing farm work is not going to be an accountant as well . 
there is one delay after another . 
why so ? 
people do not enrol in this program because the forms are too hard to fill out and the results are very questionable . 
yet when this program was implemented , there was a national revenue advisory committee , which asked that there to be no payment ceilings for farmers , that asked for use of negative margins , and for no linking to NISA , the Net Income Stabilization Account . 
all that was forgotten . 
yet the people consulted knew their business and could have been of great service to the agricultural sector . 
so here we are facing a crisis that is far more acute in the west than it is in the rest of the country , and which is reflected accurately in the letters children write to the Prime Minister or the Minister of Agriculture . 
these children write that : 
" they need more than one job to survive on the farm '' . 
basically , they are complaining that their mother and father have to hold down two or three jobs in order to make ends meet until the end of the month , if not the end of the day or week . 
another child , Terryl Drisdale , wrote : 
" farmers are a unique type of people . 
i am very sure that you personally don ' t work the hours annually that the farmers do for the pay that they have at year end '' . 
it is moving , because these are sixth grade children writing the Prime Minister or the Minister of Agriculture . 
it is like a cry of dismay at that point in social terms . 
how will they cope with this crisis ? 
not with what they currently have at their disposal . 
suppliers waiting to be paid for 1998 commodities have been very patient again in 1999 . Will they continue to be ? 
when things are not going well in one sector of society , the wolf is at the door . 
so too there are people waiting to buy dirt cheap the land that is often family heritage and has been cleared and maintained by dint of hard work . 
yet , the government believes in rural life and in the diversification of farms , but all these fine principles the government states in public do not come about in a single day . 
there is also income security . 
but here we realize that the program changes every three or four years . 
how can events be followed over the long term if the programs change ? 
there were references in the throne speech to research and development . 
it mentioned increased funding for research and development . 
and it is high time , because nothing has changed since 1993 , despite the efforts in the last budget . 
what is important , and needs to be mentioned , is the need for those doing basic research to be independent . 
the programs now in place often involve partnerships . 
sometimes not much is said about the partner , but when its involvement runs to 90 % , as it does with certain large corporations , the large corporation picks the research topics and they do not include basic research to help the public . 
all these partnerships inhibit research . 
there is also the issue of genetically engineered organisms , one in which I have a great interest . 
yesterday , we heard the Prime Minister begin his speech by stating that the next century will be the century of the Pacific . 
but , if we do not resolve firmly to label genetically engineered products , we will not get very far selling to the Pacific . 
are we prepared to lose Asian markets ? 
this is a very good question which must be asked and which has a major impact on the country ' s farmers . 
i would like to conclude - I could go on at great length about genetically engineered organisms , but I will address the matter at another time - by referring members to page 19 of the throne speech , which reads as follows : 
the Government will protect the health of Canadians by strengthening Canada ' s food safety program , by taking further action on environmental health issues , [ - ] pesticides [ - ] 
this sounds like the bill that died when Parliament was prorogued , but it is reminiscent of the premises of Bill C - 80 , a superstructure with no accountability , where failures in the health system make us fear the worst . 
we cannot add all this to the work of Health Canada when we already know that the brain drain has left it unable to evaluate all the services the government should provide . 
so I have some major concerns . 
despite its lofty title , the throne speech leaves me , as agriculture critic , very puzzled . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
we are faced with a rather pathetic if not immoral situation in Canada . 
there are also individuals who are getting poorer because of the very heavy tax burden . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie : 
Mr. Speaker , that question is virtually a whole program itself . 
there is something interesting in what my colleague has said : each province that has capitulated to the federal government is experiencing delays with the transfer of assets . 
expand this situation and their jurisdiction has been totally lost just to get what they need . 
we have seen how this happened with social affairs . 
everything was turned over to the feds to solve the problem . 
now there is a heavy price to pay . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak in the debate on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
this partisan document once again follows along the main thrusts of the September 1997 throne speech . 
there is continuity here : it is a document continuing centralization and non - respect of Quebec ' s jurisdiction . 
the Prime Minister and his so - called strategists have taken each of the themes of 1997 , changed their titles and added paragraphs . 
a fine makeover , with the maple leaf in the background . 
the editorial of Le Devoir of October 13 provides in this regard : " It would be good news for once to hear that the federal government wanted to honour the principle underlying all federal regimes , which is the sharing of jobs and jurisdictions and proposed to its partners that the provinces come up with a consensus on joint policy . 
new real desire remains to be proven , however , especially since the speech includes a number of projects that could rapidly become irritants '' . 
this centralizing recipe now includes a social union sauce , which could well further spoil relations between Ottawa and Quebec City . 
i smile at the thought of Liberal ministers and members talking partnerships , agreements with their partners . 
how could we be expected to believe such a philosophy when the government itself cannot respect jurisdictions and is continually encroaching on their jurisdiction ? 
examples include the case of the national plan on skills and learning for the 21 st century , future health research institutes and the five year infrastructure program . 
on this issue , the federal government has made a commitment , but we will have to wait until the end of the year 2000 , not the end of the current year . 
yet , during the prebudget consultations , all the municipalities of the electoral district of Lotbini è re asked me to urge the federal government to take immediate action . 
another vague promise , with no specific funding , and we will have to wait for the 2001 budget to know the specific commitments of the federal government . 
i have made a diagnosis of this government . 
it makes a promise now , but only for 12 , 15 or 24 months from now . In the meantime , those who need the money suffer . 
let us now go back to employment insurance . 
considering that 60 % of the unemployed currently do not qualify for benefits , what do we find in the throne speech to give some hope to these people ? 
not much . 
yet , when the federal government talks about fighting poverty , it should give priority to the employment insurance program , which is one of the causes of poverty and one of the main reasons why people are leaving the regions of Quebec . 
what have the Liberals done to help regional development ? 
they have come up with minor partisan measures and they made a big deal about some small subsidies , as they did last month when they sent a delegation of five federal ministers headed by the new minister of patronage , assisted by the new secretary of state for professional sport - I mean amateur sport , but given his recent statements , I am more and more convinced that his job is geared primarily to helping professional sports . 
but let us go back to unemployment and regional employment insurance rates . 
this is an absurd situation which jeopardizes the very foundation of the employment insurance program . 
in my riding of Lotbini è re , the regional rate set for the regional county municipality of Lotbini è re is very detrimental to the people there , compared to the riding ' s other RCMs . 
having two regional rates create two classes of unemployed in the riding . 
people constantly contact my offices to condemn this social injustice . 
the Corporation de d é fense des droits sociaux de Lotbini è re , social and economic stakeholders and the unemployed will mobilize in early November to convince the new Minister of Human Resources Development to correct the mistakes made by her predecessor . 
once again , I would like to explain this administrative nightmare . 
the rate , which is determined arbitrarily by Statistics Canada and considered to be realistic , means that one must work 630 hours to be eligible for benefits for a period ranging from 17 to 40 weeks . 
in the other RCMs in my riding , the regional rate is 11.2 % and the number of hours required is 490 to be eligible for benefits for a period ranging from a minimum of 23 weeks to a maximum of 45 weeks . 
it is a gross injustice for the RCM of Lotbini è re , since the socio - economic profile is the same for the whole riding . 
therefore , setting a single employment insurance rate for the whole riding that is in line with our true socio - economic profile is of the utmost importance . 
businesses are also penalized by this regional rate , since they do not have access to the same federal subsidy programs as businesses from other areas in my riding . 
in the Speech from the Throne , the federal government expressed its intention to make the Internet accessible to everybody . 
first of all , a lot of parents cannot even afford to buy a computer . 
second , in our opinion , the CRTC should ensure that all Canadians have access to an individual telephone line so that they can connect with the Internet . 
right here at home on the eve of the third millennium , certain regions in Quebec and in the rest of the country still do not even have the basic services necessary to access the Internet . 
this government is completely cut off from the daily lives of people in our society . 
but it is in a big rush to get its hands on our money . 
the budget surpluses belong to all taxpayers , not just the Minister of Finance , who fiddles with the books and conceals the real state of the country ' s finances . 
the Minister of Finance already has the necessary leeway to announce immediate tax cuts for middle income taxpayers , those whose hard - earned money paid down the federal deficit , unemployed workers , youth , the sick and the poor . 
in short , my conclusion is very simple : the federal government has money to spend in fields of provincial jurisdiction , but not a cent when it comes to problems for which it is accountable . 
that is the Canadian way of the Liberal government as I see it . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member for Lotbini è re on his excellent speech . 
i think he is very close to his constituents . 
he has shown us that the Speech from the Throne truly has nothing to do with the real concerns of the people . 
the federal government has chosen to spend in sectors that are not its responsibility and not to make appropriate decisions in those that are , such as employment insurance . 
i would like the member for Lotbini è re to explain the whole question of the map used to determine how employment insurance will apply in a given area , a problem he mentioned in his speech , which is being experienced where he comes from especially . 
it is an important matter for the unemployed that are concerned , but it is also a problem throughout Canada , because in this case as in others , the federal government is refusing to revisit the current employment insurance legislation . 
all sorts of situations are getting worse , and I would like him to tell us more about those concerning the map that governs the rates of unemployment and that defines the number of weeks that people need in order to receive benefits . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as the regions are concerned , this is again an invention by this government , an invention for interference , differing regional rates , so as to penalize all of the unemployed . 
now that I am regional development critic , I must say that this is a situation that is greatly harmful to regional development . 
here is an example . 
i am in my office and someone comes in to tell me " I am 10 hours short of eligibility for employment insurance '' . 
so I explain the legislation to the person , who goes away . 
he then meets a neighbour who lives 20 kilometres from him , and that person is getting employment insurance . 
how is an MP who wants to be fair , and wants to see all his constituents treated justly , to explain such a crazy situation ? 
apart from that there is not a single public servant in my riding , which has a population of 70,000 . 
this is abnormal , and once again it is the outcome of the famous employment insurance reform , which penalizes everyone in Quebec . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not hear an emphasis with respect to tax reduction in terms of what this country clearly needs . 
this country needs broad based tax reduction . 
a number of speeches have been made in this House that have focused on the necessity to have broad based tax reduction . 
we have seen growth in those jurisdictions . 
we have seen it in Ireland . 
we have seen it in the province of Ontario . 
does the hon. member believe that the government ' s rhetoric in the throne speech with respect to tax reduction is just that , or is the government capable of providing tax reductions that Canadian families need so desperately ? 
Mr. Odina Desrochers : 
Mr. Speaker , my answer to the Progressive Conservative member is this : let him find one single line that is clear in the Speech from the Throne . 
it is a bunch of vague promises , with no real commitments . 
an hon. member : 
like abolishing the GST . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers : 
how do Canadians and Quebecers react to such a document ? 
the 1997 speech was just as vague in terms of commitments . 
two years later , nothing has changed . 
the plight of Quebec ' s unemployed is glaring . 
we are faced with a crisis in the fishery . 
the government is trying to pass legislation to intrude into provincial jurisdictions , and is using this document to try to make us believe that this is the Canadian way . 
this sure bodes well for the future . 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour as the member for Essex to speak to the throne speech which was so eloquently delivered by Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson whom I would like to congratulate on her appointment as Governor General . 
i know that she will bring respect , integrity and enthusiasm to her new position and will serve the Canadian people both gracefully and honourably . 
today I would like to reaffirm my thanks to the constituents of Essex for giving me the privilege and opportunity to represent them in the House of Commons over the past six years . 
as many members know , my riding of Essex is situated in southwestern Ontario , the southernmost part of Canada and consists of the newly amalgamated towns of Amherstburg , Essex , Kingsville , Lakeshore , LaSalle , part of the town of Tecumseh and all of Pelee Island . 
Windsor and Essex county has been the core of Canada ' s automotive sector and industry since 1925 . 
Daimler Chrysler Canada ' s operations are headquartered here , along with major facilities for both Ford and General Motors . 
since 1991 their combined investment has totalled over $ 6 billion . 
their presence has attracted over 500 manufacturers of auto related parts , supplying state of the art machinery , machine tools , moulds , stampings , dies and automation transfer equipment . 
with less than 2 % of Canada ' s population , our region is home to 20 % of all tool and die makers , 50 % of industrial mould manufacturers and 80 % of the automation transfer machine companies operating in Canada . 
our workforce is diversified , dependable and disciplined with old - fashioned work ethics . 
keeping our workforce in tune with technology is a top priority among our manufacturers and educational institutions . 
the University of Windsor has established itself as one of Canada ' s foremost research universities . 
in partnership with government and industry , it has initiated programs pioneering the development and deployment of advanced technologies . 
in addition , the Chrysler Canada University of Windsor Automotive Research and Development Centre , a joint venture , brings together the best business and educational minds to create both company driven and research oriented solutions . 
as well , St. Clair College of Applied Arts and Technology concentrates on management productivity , trends and skills development and manufacturing technologies in tool and die and mould making . 
we are responsive to the industry ' s needs where training is carried out on the factory floor where students gain access to the latest in technology . 
as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry in the last session of parliament , and as the member for Essex with such a vibrant technology based community , I was pleased to hear the Governor General outline the steps that we will take to improve our infrastructure of skills innovation and research . 
at one of our hearings , the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada , the Canadian Association of University Teachers and the Canadian Consortium for Research , the Humanities and Social Sciences Federation of Canada , and the Canadian Graduate Council highlighted their focus together in the opening paragraph of their submission by stating : 
Canadians realize that innovation is vital . 
it is the foundation for our economic and social prosperity and our ability to compete in a global market . 
to be successful , we need a steady stream of new ideas , a well - educated workforce for the knowledge economy , and mechanisms to transfer effectively ideas from the laboratory bench to the marketplace . 
and we need to ensure that the innovation process is built on a strong and healthy foundation . 
the increased support to the granting councils will ensure that a healthy foundation exists . 
it will enable them to forge new partnerships with our universities such as the University of Windsor , to attract the best research minds in the world . 
this will be developed through the innovative program of 21 st century chairs for research excellence that the Prime Minister outlined in his speech . 
through the research granting councils the Government of Canada will fund the creation of 1,200 chairs . 
the committee also heard that the number of students in the natural sciences and engineering is increasing and the need for support for funding their research in this area is increasing correspondingly . 
we also know that the government must intervene and act in order to help the challenges of commercialization . 
as Robert Giroux from the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada said , " To me , the major impediments are the ability of the universities to identify the potential for a research product , and secondly being able to move that product to the marketplace '' . 
we know the throne speech identified that the Canadian government will help to assist in the commercialization of research from universities and government centres . 
this is now a priority of the government . 
the government also understands that Canadians cannot be productive and prosperous if they are not healthy . 
in the throne speech we confirmed our continued commitment to ensuring that our health care system will meet the needs of our growing population . 
we will build on our health record by supporting partners and testing innovations in home care , pharmacare and integrated service delivery over the next two years . 
a modern health information system will make health information more accessible to professionals and our citizens . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it being 6.15 p.m. , it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the amendment to the amendment now before the House . 
the question is on the amendment to the amendment .

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the House resumed from October 14 consideration of the motion for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the opening of the session and of the amendment . 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , continuing the debate today I would like to talk about health . 
our health depends on safe and healthy food and I would like to remind the House that the agricultural industry in my riding is one of the largest in southeastern Canada . 
the growing season is the longest in Canada , averaging 212 days , with 350,000 acres of rich fertile and relatively flat farmland . 
farmers provide an annual yield of fruits and vegetables , legumes and grains totalling over $ 200 million annually . 
today more than 50 food and beverage processing plants account for over $ 1 billion in shipments . 
our farmers take pride in nurturing the soil and producing the freshest and healthiest produce possible . 
to assist the farmers in my riding of Essex and elsewhere we will use the upcoming World Trade Organization negotiations , including those on agriculture , to help build a more transparent rules based global trading system , one that ensures a level playing field , provides better access to world markets for Canadian companies in all sectors and respects the needs of Canadians , our culture and the environment . 
i would like to remind the House that agricultural production and its future is the very soul of this nation . 
the Liberal government has been and will continue to be a very strong supporter of agriculture . 
as the throne speech stated , Canada ' s ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be a part of Canada ' s strength in the 21 st century . 
just yesterday Canada ' s leading automakers announced a new fuel endorsement program designed to encourage gasoline retailers to sell fuels that meet strict specifications , including lower sulphur , positive combustion chamber deposit controls , no heavy metal additives and enhanced driveability characteristics . 
those retailers who meet these specifications will be able to obtain a licence to use the automakers ' choice logo and designation . 
to quote General Motor ' s president Maureen Kempston Darkes : " If all vehicles on the road in Canada today could access automakers ' choice gasoline , it would be the equivalent of eliminating the smog - causing emissions from almost two million cars and light trucks '' . 
this will positively affect all Canadians and my constituents by reducing the already unacceptable levels of air pollution in Windsor and Essex county . 
we will go further . 
by improving our physical infrastructure for the 21 st century we will not only aid trade and economic growth , we will ensure that we have clean air and water . 
the government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach by the end of the year 2000 an agreement on a five year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country . 
tourism is a multibillion dollar industry in Windsor and Essex which attracts day - trippers and vacationers by bridge or tunnel to an uncrowded , relaxed and safe destination . 
tourism accounts for our fourth largest industry , with 12 % of the workforce or 16,300 people employed in accommodations , food service , amusement and recreation . 
the Ambassador Bridge is North America ' s number one international border crossing , with over 10 million vehicles per year travelling between our two great nations . 
municipalities in my riding and individual companies have communicated to me the importance of creating a better highway system to ensure the safety of our citizens , the efficient movement of our trades and goods , and to increase the movement of people to our tourist attractions . 
with the millennium approaching , Canada is preparing for the arrival of the 21 st century and its immediate future . 
we cannot speak of the future without looking to our children . 
this government recognizes that the viability and economic strength of this nation depend on the opportunities we give our children today . 
if Canada is going to be the place to be in the knowledge based economy of the 21 st century , young Canadians , our leaders and innovators of tomorrow , must be equipped with state of the art high tech skills . 
as well , they must have access to the tools and educational opportunities which will help them apply their creative talents and hone their skills . 
the community access program has ensured that we will have public Internet sites connected in 10,000 rural and urban areas by the year 2000 and Computers for Schools , whose goal of providing 250,000 computers for Canadian schools , is 60 % complete . 
the throne speech reaffirms that we will build on this strong foundation and use the world leading high tech infrastructure we are putting in place , not only to enhance the skills and opportunities of young Canadians , but also to broaden their understanding of their fellow Canadians and the Canadian experience . 
as the nation ' s finances have improved , the government has begun to deliver broad based tax relief totalling $ 16.5 billion over three years . 
as the nation ' s finances continue to improve , the government will further reduce taxes to increase the disposable income of Canadians , enhance innovation and risk taking , and create a more robust economy . 
in its next budget the government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reductions . 
i have had my opportunity to comment on the throne speech and the vision the government has unveiled to bring our strong nation into the next millennium . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to take a look at some things that have happened since 1993 . 
about 40 % of farmers are considering bankruptcy at this very moment . 
this morning there are about 166,000 out of every million children who are going to school hungry . 
they are living in poverty . 
that is nearly three times as bad as it was in 1993 . 
the people on hundreds of reserves in this country are living in squalor . 
i have seen it with my own eyes . 
i know what is there . 
we have a fishery problem that is going on now . 
it is unbelievable that it would come to this , and all since 1993 . 
we have first degree cop killers , murderers , walking away from minimum security institutions . 
we have killers in minimum security institutions and this throne speech talks about the safety of Canadians as a top priority . 
when we look at what is going on today and that which has occurred since 1993 , I would suggest to the Canadian people throughout this land that this entire front row is filled with incompetent people , including the Prime Minister . 
how would the member respond to these tragedies that are happening today , right before her eyes ? 
Ms. Susan Whelan : 
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect to the hon. member , which is hard for me to find right now , the government has already invested an additional $ 1.7 billion toward low income families and children . 
the member who just spoke voted against that . 
he now has the nerve to stand in the House and talk about poverty and children when he voted against money going to low income families and to children . 
we have new programs in our schools . 
we are connected to the Internet with leading edge technology . 
we are investing in research . 
we are attracting the best and brightest to Canada . 
maybe the hon. member should come to the industry committee once in a while and hear what researchers in Canada have to say about the opportunities that exist in Canada and what attracts them . 
the bottom line is not the dollars . 
it is where they can go and what they can do . 
if members on that side would show up at committee they would obviously know that . 
since they are never there they cannot say anything about it . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously we have again heard non - answers from a government member to some very direct questions from my colleague from Wild Rose . 
the member talked about being on track . 
the member mentioned broad based tax relief as though the government had actually delivered it . 
we talk about the $ 16 billion of tax relief but we do not mention that we have raised and wrung $ 18 billion more out of Canadians at the very same time . 
that is a net loss and the member has the gall to stand in her place and defend her government by saying that it has provided broad based tax relief . 
how can she do that ? 
Ms. Susan Whelan : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the math on the other side is a little distorted as usual . 
when we go from double digit unemployment to single digit unemployment we obviously will have more Canadians working . 
more Canadians working means more tax dollars . 
that is why we have been able to provide $ 16.5 billion in tax relief and why we made a very clear announcement in the throne speech . 
in case they did not hear me the first time , we very clearly state in the throne speech that the government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reductions . 
Canadians know that we have a balanced approach . 
Canadians supported us in the 1997 election on a balanced approach . 
i know it bothers some members on the opposite side to think that Canadians want social programs at the same time as they want balance , with debt reduction and tax relief . 
just the other day I had a dinner meeting and by chance two people there , one from the health care sector and one who makes substantial amounts of money from a different type of profession , were at odds on what should happen , but both of them agreed that we have to support the social programs as much as we have to provide tax relief . 
i very clearly answered the question when I stated that we have gone from double digit to single digit unemployment . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
reflecting on the throne speech , some Liberals seem to believe that spending money on government programs aimed at children will help with the challenges that Canadian families face . 
unfortunately , investing in more new federal programs , the latest code word being investing , is really just more spending and spending financed by whom ? 
it is financed by parents . 
it completely misses the importance of families in their struggles . 
the issues and pressures facing Canadian families are bigger than a few new spending programs . 
everything from fiscal and economic policy to justice and community safety issues all affect family units . 
tax inequalities and inequities mean that families have to consider what effect employment decisions will have on their tax bill . 
1020 
a massive underground economy means that families are the victims of an especially unbalanced tax burden . 
lower productivity means a less vibrant economy , higher long term and youth unemployment . 
youth unemployment is almost twice the rate of overall unemployment . 
many of the jobs young people get are across the border . 
the brain drain is a real thing and it is breaking up families . 
oppressive regulations and bloated bureaucracies stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that is birthed within the family . 
a lax attitude toward crime and criminals and using our communities as test laboratories for rehabilitating early parolees makes danger on our streets and violence in the playground sometimes a reality . 
probably a most significant concern to many in the House is the political interference and anti - democratic patronage which weakens the faith of our young people in the system . 
special interest group funding , political slush fund contributions and other frivolous attitudes toward spending tax dollars encourages a sort of family tax rage . 
children and families are all affected by these issues . 
we have heard the government talk about its concern for children but I and other members of the House have repeatedly heard it refuse to deliver even when it had the opportunity to do so . 
this is a government that says it is against child pornography , it is for greater protection from child sex offenders and it is against family tax discrimination . 
let us look at its actions because that is really the most telling sign . 
we have seen , in the country , the courts strike down laws that make child pornography illegal . 
we saw 79 Liberal MPs and senators write a letter to the Prime Minister urging him not to wait for the appeal of the B.C. decision to be heard but to immediately act in defence of Canada ' s children . 
these Liberal members recommended that strong new child pornography legislation be introduced as soon as the House returns . 
that sounds good . 
i and I am sure all the members of my party would have signed that letter . 
in fact , they even went on in the letter to encourage the Prime Minister to consider the use of the notwithstanding clause to send a clear message that Canada ' s charter of rights and freedoms would never again be used to defend sexual abuse of Canadian children . 
let us talk about another situation . 
the Liberals had an opportunity to protect children from convicted sex offenders but failed . 
bill C - 69 was in the Senate before the pension bill but they overlooked that and went for the money . 
they pushed through the pension bill to grab the money and left our children less protected . 
if that is not a telling sign of priorities , I do not know what is . 
actions speak louder than words to Canadians . 
let us look at another one . 
the Liberals have refused and failed to end the tax discrimination faced by single income families with children . 
we know that in the last federal budget a typical single earner family with two children , a family of four with a $ 45,000 income , pays about $ 4,900 in personal tax . 
the same single income family is paying 136 % more than a dual earner family . 
that is right out of the budget . 
however , the Liberals voted against the motion in the House that addresses tax discrimination . 
they said no . 
the vote was 123 in favour , most united on this side , and 145 against on that side . 
this affirms again that the true vision of the Liberals is a continuation of their legacy of high taxes and less choice for families . 
the Liberal MPs say that they are concerned about pornography and child pornography . 
what are they doing about it ? 
nothing . 
we hear that they are concerned about protecting our kids , but when they had a chance to do something about it they did nothing . 
the Liberals talk about caring for and wanting to address tax discrimination in the country . 
they had the opportunity but did not move on it . 
what is all this talk about a legacy ? 
we hear them talking about a legacy . 
the Prime Minister wants a legacy . 
the Liberal member from St. Paul ' s was quoted in the Hamilton spectator as saying : " We want something that is a legacy '' . 
will anyone remember if we gave them tax cuts ? 
if we are going to be remembered we must do some great thing , some great national project . 
this begs the question of what is more important to them , their legacy or our children . 
parents look after the needs of kids best but it looks like they might also be asked to finance the Liberals ' legacy building project . 
where is the credibility in all of this when we hear all this talk about a children ' s agenda ? 
to me it sounds more like an agenda for children . 
the Liberal member for Sarnia - Lambton was quoted recently . 
i have to agree with the member , although I think his career path in the Liberal Party is going to be severely stilted and derailed . 
he fears that the national children ' s agenda is a code word for big spending , social engineering and government meddling . 
this was said by a Liberal member and I can agree with him . 
he is right on . 
i have to inform the government that it actually already has a legacy . 
the Liberal legacy is one of high tax , of high national debt , of increasing taxes and of a huge national debt borne by our children . 
families in Canada are actually aware of the Liberal government ' s agenda . 
they are quite confident that they have the ability to look after the children . 
statistics Canada noted in a recent study that by far the majority of children living in Canada are in excellent and very good health according to their parents . 
i do not think parents want interference by the Liberal government . 
they want to be left to raise their families as they see fit . 
they want a government that will give them less taxes and less government . 
they want a government that respects the natural authority of parents and the choices they are best suited to make on behalf of their children . 
i have a lot more to say but I will leave it for another time . 
my number one concern is that families in the country be given the respect and the freedom to raise their children as they see fit . 
that the amendment be amended by inserting after the words " airline industry '' , the words : " and give Canadians some indication of its vision of Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century '' . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the question is on the amendment to the amendment . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the last speaker mentioned that parents look after their children best . 
over all I would agree with him except that there are situations where parents do not always look after the needs of their children best . 
it is not because they do not want to but in some circumstances they cannot . 
does the hon. member think that every parent should be the teacher of their child or the doctor of their child ? 
as citizens , as a group , can we not help each other look after our children ? 
everything a government does is not necessarily some sort of nefarious interference with those of us who are raising our children . 
in fact we can help each other build a stronger society by helping relieve the stress of a single person or a single couple looking after their children exclusively . 
Mr. Eric Lowther : 
Mr. Speaker , I think that is a very reasonable question . 
i want to be clear on this particular point . 
i am in no way advocating that as a community and as a nation of caring people we do not support one another or that we do not encourage one another in the rearing of our children . 
what I am focusing on is the natural authority of parents in their families to make their decisions . 
when they want to seek help and when they want to get advice from their neighbours , their community or even from their government , that should be a decision left solely in the hands of the parents to decide . 
i am not talking about situations of neglect or abuse where perhaps there is a legitimate requirement for a government to have some intervention . 
we are primarily concerned that public policy and government policy respect the role of parents to make the decisions in the best interest of their children . 
they should be able to make those choices in a fair way where tax policies do not discriminate against one choice over another . 
there should be a fair and equal playing field for parents to make the decisions because they are the ones who can best make the needs assessments of their children . 
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Hamilton West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just read over the hon. member ' s amendment to the amendment . 
after the words " airline industry " he wants to insert the words " and give Canadians some indication of its vision of Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century '' . 
could the hon. member tell me whether or not he is aware of the process the government and in fact all parties of the House of Commons are going through at this very moment ? 
it is the only committee of the House of Commons to get moving on its work . 
yesterday we had our first meeting . 
as early as Monday afternoon we are meeting with an agenda . 
from all indications from my colleagues on the committee , as well as the critic for the member ' s party , the airline issue is probably the issue the committee will be seized with immediately . 
the member indicates that he is looking to the government to provide vision . 
there are members on this side of the House who are concerned . 
they are bringing their concerns to the attention of our internal economic development committee chaired by the member for Stoney Creek , and that will move forward . 
is the hon. member aware of all these different things that are going on , including the Competition Bureau which will make representation to the minister by the end of the month in the form of a report ? 
the Minister of Transport is being seized with this issue and is getting all this input . 
i wonder if the member can acknowledge that all this work is being done . 
Mr. Eric Lowther : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , I am aware of that work being done . 
i am not saying it should intrude in that situation , but at the same time I am saying there is a vacuum over there . 
there is no plan . 
it is trying to cope with the realities of the marketplace and struggling with how to do it . 
i am aware of what the hon. member is pointing out , but we are not seeing any clear direction from the government at all . 
it is trying to cope with the situation . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to enter into the debate on the Speech from the Throne . 
it is quite evident from what was not in the Speech from the Throne that the government is clearly failing in a number of areas . 
there was a failure of the Liberal government to acknowledge those issues or spell them out in any remote detail or even in any generality . 
one of the major four areas is the fishing crisis happening on our east coast . 
the government did not talk about that or mention it in the throne speech . 
the government did not address agriculture in that throne speech . 
that is a major issue for many hard working Canadians in the agricultural field and it affects all of us . 
it has neglected to talk about the airline industry , as was just pointed out by my colleague for Calgary Centre . 
it has failed to talk about immigration and the crisis happening in the broken system that became so clearly evident this past summer off the west coast of Vancouver . 
i will focus most of my attention in my speech this morning on the broken immigration system and the failure of the government to address the crying need for change in that area . 
it is woeful that the government has not taken action . 
the incidents that happened this past summer of which all Canadians across the country are aware have in essence highlighted and shone a beacon of light on the government ' s failure in this area . 
my colleagues that were here years before I came here made a lot of proactive positive suggestions to the ministers of immigration , to the government , to the Prime Minister , and they have not acted on them . 
they rebut any idea of change out of hand because it comes from opposition members or from anybody else . 
they believe they have the answers and will do what they want . 
members of the opposition will continue to urge that the government take action . 
failing that , we will work in whatever way possible to become the government so that we can put in place proactive positive approaches that solve glaring problems across the country which the government is not willing to even go near . 
i will move into a little more detail about some of points made about our immigration system . 
i will quote a piece of information that came from a report commissioned by the minister of immigration entitled " Not Just Numbers : 
a Canadian Framework for Future Immigration '' . 
this study was put together by some independent individuals who did a broad based consultation process , in the government ' s own words , to find out what needs to be done . 
here is something that was included in the report : 
in recent years in Canada , over half of all the asylum - seeking arrivals at ports of entry had destroyed all identification documents before being seen by officials - 
it goes on to say : 
recent arrivals have mainly come from countries which are stable enough to provide identification documents . 
generally , these individuals are uncooperative and refuse to provide their names , their countries of origin , or anything else that might assist the expeditious processing of their claim . 
the idea that all such persons are reluctant to give such details because of refugee - based fears , or that the persons helping them enter Canada are latter - day Raoul Wallenbergs , is naive . 
the people - smuggling business is now as lucrative as the international drug trade . 
this was in a report submitted to the government , commissioned by the government and in fact has been lost on the government . 
it is another report that has simply been shelved or put away to gather dust for another day . 
we can say this because the government has rejected that notion out of hand as well as many other proposals which have been put forward . 
it is a shame that is its approach to governing . 
immigration department officials in response to the people smuggling that occurred on the west coast this past summer have said the following . 
an Immigration Canada spokesperson named Jim Redmond has said : 
it ' s hard on the people who are smuggled . 
it ' s organized crime at its worst . 
he also said : 
there is a good chance we could have more arrivals this year . 
it would be naive to say it ' s all over . 
what appears to be happening is that the Liberal government is hoping the issue will just fade away . 
if it does nothing long enough other issues will pop up which will take the attention away from this glaring failure within its mandate so that it does not have to act on it . 
the underlying approach of the government is if it does not do anything long enough maybe people will forget about it . 
people are not forgetting about it . 
they are realizing that the government is failing in the area of addressing the immigration system . 
i have sat with my colleagues for two years on the immigration committee . 
we have had many good debates . 
we have tried to work together . 
we have had many very heated debates at times too about the issue because it is a very important one . 
we have been able to work co - operatively at times to look at ideas and solutions . 
what tends to happen is they get rejected because they are not approved by the minister , by the prime minister or by the cabinet . 
that is a shame too because there are many things we would like to see happen that are not happening . 
the Reform Party offers a proactive positive approach rather than this force of negativity of doing nothing offered by the Liberal government . 
we have ideas , suggestions and solutions which have been put forward time and time again . 
i will mention a few of them . 
those who are not true refugees will abuse that and often do . 
they disappear and do not go to their hearings . 
that is a problem . 
we need a system that addresses that , a system that has individuals maintained in an area until it is determined whether they are really refugees or not . 
that process needs to be expedited . 
it cannot go on for years and years and years as it currently does . 
it is not fair to them and it is not fair to Canadians . 
that process needs to be determined quickly , in a matter of days and weeks , not months and years . 
it needs to be done quickly , and once a decision is made , then it should be acted upon . 
if the person is determined not to be a refugee , then they should be removed from our country post - haste . 
if a person is determined to be a refugee , then they should be integrated into our communities as quickly as possible . 
the Liberal government ' s approach is to leave people ' s lives in limbo , to allow people who are not refugees to be here and then to go after people who are true refugees and deport them . 
the system is broken at both ends and this Liberal government is failing . 
the facts are in . 
the perception across our country is that this government does not think it is a problem . 
the Prime Minister himself said there is nothing wrong with our immigration laws and there is nothing wrong with our refugee process . 
he said that this summer . 
in light of what is happening on the west coast , it is unbelievable . 
it is absolutely shocking that this government , in the light of information , details and facts from its own people , fails to act . 
it is unbelievable . 
i urge my colleagues on the government side to apply pressure to change the system . 
failing that , the members of the opposition will work day after day in this place , in committee and on the streets of our nation to be proactive and positive . 
we will make a commitment here and now that we will change the system not only within immigration , but within all the other areas outlined in the Leader of the Opposition ' s speech for a positive vision for the future of this country , because it is clear that today in this land the Liberal government has failed and is visionless . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like the hon. member to comment on something I find very interesting . 
there has not been one question or comment on his presentation from the members opposite . 
the Liberals are afraid to tackle difficult issues and this is a difficult issue . 
i would like the member to comment on the government ' s handling of this issue , in particular that none of the government members are willing to ask a question or make a comment on the issue . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , I can only say in response to that very good comment from my colleague that it is clear that the government has no answers . 
the member for Vancouver - Kingsway across the way is a member of the immigration committee . 
she is simply not offering any solutions . 
members of the government , ministers of the crown have said very interesting things . 
that is what he has said . 
an hon. member : 
wait until winter . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
that is right . 
the minister said wait until the weather gets bad so the ships stop coming . 
what kind of approach is that ? 
that is the government ' s solution to a very important issue . 
it is a do nothing approach , just wait and hope that people do not notice . 
well , people have noticed . 
if the Liberals will not change the system , we will work day after day to sit on that side in order to put in place our proactive solutions . 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker let me say to the deputy citizenship critic for the Reform Party that as usual he has it wrong . 
look at Canada and the success that we have had . 
as a matter of fact Canada has been named the best country in the world for the last six years and it is because of the people we have in this country . 
the people in this country were immigrants or refugees at one point in time . 
when the member says he wants to make a determination on refugee cases in a matter of days or weeks , he is wrong . 
we cannot have a judicial system or any system that has any kind of justice that can make a determination on somebody ' s life in a day or a week . 
this is the problem the Reform Party brings to this House . 
the Reform Party has simplistic solutions that are not viable . 
our government is acting responsibly to combat international smuggling of human beings . 
the opposition parties , particularly the Reform Party on this issue , are like ambulance chasers . 
it is succeeding . 
members opposite can blow and shout but the reality is we have a system which we are continuously working on to improve . 
it is a very good and a very fair system , one which will be even better . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a broken system . 
the member is in la - la land . 
the member sits on the immigration committee and he talks about simplistic answers . 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration said wait until winter so the boats do not come anymore . 
what about that for a simplistic answer . 
that is the suggestion offered by the minister and her mouthpiece the member for Kitchener - Waterloo . 
i was in the member ' s community . 
that is the kind of approach the member takes to constituent work . 
now he has no answers . 
his government has no answers to this crisis . 
it is clear . 
the facts are in . 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to tell my colleague that our government not only cares but it also takes action . 
last month the Chinese government invited a small delegation of three Liberal MPs to go there . 
we had a very long and detailed discussion to establish co - operation between China and Canada to tackle the problem of human smuggling . 
it is the beginning of our work on immigration . 
there are many things we can tell the House . 
we not only take on our concerns but members ' concerns are also in our hands . 
we are trying to solve the problems . 
we do not just sit in this House and talk . 
talk is too easy . 
the government takes action . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , to simply say something and say it is true is an interesting concept . 
actions speak louder than words . 
the member ' s solution to the immigration crisis is to make an educational video and send that across the waters to folks so that they know to please not come because we are not sure what to do with them when they get here . 
that is the member ' s approach to this crisis . 
rather than work for legislative change with some teeth in it that will make a change and send a message internationally that Canada is not an easy mark for those who would abuse our immigration system , the member and her colleagues sit idly by and offer solutions such as waiting for winter so the boats stop coming , or putting together an educational video so that people stop coming . 
those are their suggestions , rather than using the legislative powers we have in the House to take action and make a change . 
we can work together in the House to make legislative changes to send a message internationally that Canada will not be an easy mark for those who choose to abuse our system . 
we want a positive system . 
a member has shouted out a comment that I am not going to repeat because it is in contempt . 
he said it the other day in question period under his breath . 
he does not have the intestinal fortitude to stand in his place and make that accusation because he knows he would be thrown directly out of this place . 
he does not have the guts to stand and deliver ; rather he holds his hand in front of his face and utters scurrilous remarks toward opposition members . 
that is the approach of the government , to run scared , to do nothing and utter attacks against those who offer positive proactive solutions for change . 
shame on the member and shame on every one of the Liberal members for standing idly by and doing nothing once again . 
that is the Liberal government ' s approach to governing . 
shame on the Liberal members . 
the day will come soon when we will be in the Liberal government ' s place making positive proactive solutions to address the concerns of this nation because the Liberal government simply refuses to do so . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i know we could go on with questions and comments but really the time has expired . 
given the liveliness of the debate for a Friday , perhaps we should move on to Standing Order 31 Statements by Members . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
older PERSONS 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 1 , 1999 the Canadian Medical Association joined the United Nations in celebrating the International Day of Older Persons which was put in place to recognize the contributions to society of our older citizens . 
older persons across the country and around the world are an active and important part of society . 
as fellow members of society , it is our duty to ensure these older persons receive the health care and special services they need and deserve . 
the federal government recognizes these needs and is committed to working with Canadians to continually improve our health care system . 
we must accommodate the changing demands of our aging and increasing population . 
the International Day of Older Persons gave us the opportunity to really look at this important sector of our population . 
older persons have special health care needs and services which must be made readily available to them . 
i would like to applaud the Canadian Medical Association ' s efforts during this international day . 
i urge Canadians to work together with each other and with the government to ensure our older persons are well taken care of .

genetically ENGINEERED FOODS 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak on behalf of many Canadians in my riding of Nanaimo - Cowichan and across the country who are concerned about the introduction of genetically engineered foods to the marketplace . 
while everyone is interested in ensuring that the world ' s food supply grows and that the hunger pangs of children and indeed all people disappear , there are many who share concern about the safety of genetically engineered foods . 
there are too many outstanding issues and too many questions of what if . 
these questions require full answers . 
the safety of our food supply cannot and must not fall into question . 
we must learn from past failures , such as the testing of our blood supply , and ensure the public that the same mistakes will not be made again . 
we must take time now to ensure that the safety of these foods is without question . 
i have currently submitted a private member ' s bill to be drafted that calls for further investigation into the regulations concerning genetically engineered foods and their mandatory labelling . 
until this process is complete , I believe that the questions will remain unanswered . 
in the near future I will be asking for support of this bill by the members of the House .

gasoline PRICES 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there was a huge jump in the price of gas in Ontario this summer . 
in addition , the major oil companies continue to jerk around gas prices and Canadians to maximize their profits . 
i know the price of crude oil has gone up , but that in no way explains current high gas prices . 
some say that more than seven cents of the new price is excess profits for the corporations . 
i urge the government to initiate another inquiry into the lack of competition in gas pricing in Ontario . 
i believe the virtual elimination of small retailers has produced a monopoly in the province . 
i also urge the government to persuade the Government of Ontario to use the threat of gas price regulation , which is clearly in the jurisdiction of Queen ' s Park , to pressure the oil companies to change their ways . 
* * * 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to congratulate a fellow islander , Mr. Wade MacLaughlan , on his recent appointment as the President of the University of Prince Edward Island . 
Mr. MacLaughlan was installed as the fifth president and vice chancellor of UPEI on October 3 . 
he was chosen from among the country ' s leading academics for , among other things , his solid record in university administration with the University of New Brunswick . 
Mr. MacLaughlan holds several degrees , including a Master of Law from Yale University . 
his passionate commitment to the island , outstanding experience in university administration and wealth of connections to the community will help strengthen UPEI . 
indeed , UPEI will be the place to be as we turn the century . 
congratulations to Wade , his family and all islanders . 
* * * 
organ DONATION 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish ( Mississauga Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure it will surprise many to learn that Canada has one of the lowest organ donations rates in the world . 
last spring the Minister of Health asked the Standing Committee on Health to examine this very important issue and to make recommendations about ways to improve Canada ' s regretful donation rates . 
the committee tabled its report in April and I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister of Health tabled the government ' s response to that report with the clerk earlier today . 
i am also pleased to note that when Canada ' s health ministers met last month in Charlottetown they agreed to establish a council on organ and tissue donation and transplantation in Canada . 
this will give Canada a co - ordinated , comprehensive and integrated donation and transplantation strategy across the country . 
the council ' s business plan will be reviewed in November . 
it is my hope that these efforts will go a long way to improving Canada ' s organ donation rate .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have had the privilege over the past two years of working with some of the most extraordinary Canadians I have ever met . 
first and foremost is a lady by the name of Leona Freed . 
Ms. Freed has built the First Nation ' s Accountability Coalition in an effort to restore hope to those feeling hopelessness at the hands of chiefs and councils on their reserves . 
i must also recognize people like Yolande Redcalf , Greg Twoyoungmen , Rita King , Edwin One Owl , Roy Littlechief , Mike Calder , Laura Deedza and Debbie Neepoose , just to name a few . 
each of these people have selflessly contributed to the fight for a better life for future generations .

world FOOD DAY 
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Saturday , October 16 has been designated World Food Day . 
at the world food summit in Rome in November 1996 Canada joined 186 other nations to endorse the summit ' s goal , which is to reduce the number of undernourished people by half by the year 2015 . 
canada ' s action plan for food security , launched by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food on World Food Day last year , is the result of that commitment . 
as a major exporter of food and related products and expertise , and as one of the largest donors of food aid , Canada has made some very valuable contributions to world food security . 
fighting food insecurity is a collective effort by government , by civil society , by business and by communities . 
it is also an individual effort from all of us . 
on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food and myself I encourage everyone to demonstrate their concern by contributing a food donation to their local food bank . 
this year ' s theme is " Youth Against Hunger '' . 
this is a good time to remind Canada ' s young people of the positive role they can play in the fight against worldwide hunger and in the achievement of food security for all .

foster FAMILIES 
Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we forget and all too often minimize the contribution made by foster families in our society . 
in Quebec , the third week of October is set aside to officially honour foster families . 
i therefore take this opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary support foster families provide in our society . 
we therefore honour foster families for their invaluable contribution to society . 
on behalf of the members of the Bloc Quebecois , I would like to thank them and congratulate them on their unending efforts on behalf of our young people .

DYSTONIA AWARENESS WEEK 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past week , October 10 to 17 , was designated Dystonia Awareness Week . 
Dystonia is an illness characterized by involuntary spasms and muscle contractions . 
this condition results in abnormal movements and posture and can affect various body parts like the eyes , neck and limbs . 
Dystonia is often diagnosed as another ailment like arthritis or stress . 
to date there is no known cause or cure , but efforts have been made to change that . 
the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation offers support to sufferers through patient advocacy , public awareness , professional education and fundraising for research . 
i invite my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the many volunteers with the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation . 
we offer them our best wishes for a successful campaign .

Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday one of the most visionary and illustrious sons of Africa passed away . 
Julius Nyerere , the former president of Tanzania , who was one of the leading figures in Africa ' s struggle for independence in its post - colonial era , lost his battle with leukemia . 
as a former citizen of Tanzania I can attest to his greatness . 
while I disagreed with his economic and political philosophy , he commanded a high degree of respect from all Tanzanians , Africans and other citizens of the world . 
he was respected because his citizens came first . 
throughout Tanzania and Africa he was best known as Mwalimu , which means a teacher in Kiswahili . 
after his retirement he continued to play an advisory role in Tanzanian and regional politics . 
the world looked upon him to play a role in carving a bright future for Africa . 
Kwahir Mwalimu .

doctors WITHOUT BORDERS 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that all members of the House will want to join with me in congratulating Doctors Without Borders on their nomination for the Nobel Prize this year . 
doctors Without Borders represents for most of us the best of what has developed in the latter part of this troubled century . 
it is an international NGO , formed originally in France , which is now throughout the world , including Canada . 
it provides the opportunity for doctors to serve their fellow human beings across the globe , often at great risk to themselves and in places such as Kosovo , East Timor and remote corners of Asia and Africa . 
as we go into the 21 st century the world is changing and borders are losing their significance . 
doctors Without Borders is leading the way in breaking down those borders in the name of humanitarian principles which respond to the way in which Canadians see the world . 
we all rejoice in their recognition by the Nobel committee and wish them well in their important work .

nuclear TEST BAN TREATY 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the New Democratic Party of Canada and its members of parliament join with the Canadian government , the prime ministers of the United Kingdom , Germany and France and many others around the world , including of course millions of Americans and President Clinton , in regretting the tragic , stupid , shortsighted and dangerous decision of the American Senate in rejecting the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty . 
if some day the world is destroyed because of a nuclear war , those who are left , if there are any , may look back on this week as a negative turning point in the struggle to rid the world of nuclear weapons . 
a senate dominated by right wingers decided to trust in their nuclear chariots and their determination to take on all comers in a possible nuclear war instead of encouraging and building a world in which nuclear non - proliferation and abolition of nuclear weapons is seen as the way ahead . 
perhaps the Republicans should check the historical record to see what eventually happens to empires which trust more in their weapons than in the will of God for a just , peaceful and non - nuclear world .

ordre DU M É RITE AGRICOLE 1999 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on September 30 , Quebec announced the winners of the Ordre du m é rite agricole 1999 contest , thus giving recognition to the work of the agricultural producers , artists of the land , who have been feeding Quebec since its beginnings . 
the purpose of this competition is to recognize excellence and it has long been a part of the Quebec farm scene . 
Turcotte farm of Val - Brillant ; the Viel farm of Saint - Alexandre - de - Kamouraska ; the Carol and Alain Perron farm of La Baie ; the egg producers Les Oeufs d ' or of Val d ' Or , the nursery La P é pini è re Aiken of Rouyn - Noranda and the P é tri farm of Saint - Andr é - de - Kamouraska . 
today I would like to draw attention to the excellence and expertise of these agricultural professionals , and to wish a continued long life to the Ordre du m é rite agricole competition .

honourable ANTONIO LAMER 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past August 21 , the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court announced his resignation in the following words " Having heard 1,317 cases on the Supreme Court and written reasons in 345 of them , I have decided to hang up my robes early in the next millennium '' . 
called to the Bar of Quebec in 1957 , Antonio Lamer practiced criminal law until his appointment to the Quebec Superior Court on December 19 , 1969 . 
Mr. Lamer has had an impressive career and the people of Canada wish him the best in his future endeavours .

TOBIQUE FIRST NATION 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , members of the Tobique First Nation are fed up . 
the department of Indian affairs transfers $ 13 million annually to the Tobique band council , yet the council has recently run up a $ 10 million deficit . 
over the past year many band members have met with me to show how the council ' s mismanagement and the department ' s lack of accountability have prevented band members from realizing the benefits of tax dollars . 
last year the band had to suspend medical services and lay off their nurse . 
at the same time , councillors voted to raise their own pay to $ 1,000 per week . 
cheques worth $ 152,000 were written without invoices , authorization or approval . 
the council has violated every one of the remedial management plans it has signed with the department . 
we must have self - government , but government money has to go toward solving the serious social problems at Tobique instead of to band politicians and accountants . 
the members of the Tobique First Nation and I call upon the minister to appoint a third party administrator for Tobique so we can get the band back on its financial feet and help this community thrive .

jean DRAPEAU 
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past August 17 , the people of Quebec paid a final warm tribute to Jean Drapeau , mayor of Montreal for 29 years . 
no one could remain indifferent to this man of action . 
one could oppose him or support him , but never ignore him . 
he was successful in creating pride in his city , through such concrete accomplishments as Expo and the m é tro . 
the memory of this humanist and man of action will remain forever in the contemporary history of Quebec . 
thank you , Mr. Drapeau , for your great contribution to building the international renown of Montreal .

refugees 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , more than 10 years ago the Tory MP at the time , Chuck Cook , called a meeting to discuss immigration at the 800 person capacity Centennial Theatre in North Vancouver . 
so many people came to express their dissatisfaction with Canada ' s sloppy refugee processing system that hundreds had to be turned away at the door . 
within a couple of years of that meeting Chuck Cook was privately telling voters in North Vancouver that the only way to get the laws changed would be to vote Reform in the next election . 
how right he was . 
more than 10 years later , even though the solicitor general ' s department has now confirmed that Canada ' s sloppy immigration system has turned us into a haven for organized crime , absolutely nothing has been done to address these problems . 
the present minister sends out meaningless form letters to the concerned Canadians who are contacting her on this issue , and Chuck Cook ' s truth of 10 years ago remains the truth today . 
the only way the system will ever be changed is when people vote Reform . 
* * * 
first NATIONS 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the supreme court decision in the Marshall case demonstrates the negligence of the department of Indian affairs . 
the minister initiated " Gathering Strength - Canada ' s Aboriginal Action Plan " which was supposed to be a new relationship with first nations . 
the government would negotiate , not litigate . 
now we face old tensions and anger just because this government forces first nations into the courts and refuses to negotiate . 
there should never be a question of honouring a treaty . 
the government makes sure we all abide by the NAFTA and the WTO , but it has ignored agreements signed with the first nations . 
if the government continues to force the first nations all the way to the supreme court we will face more upheaval rather than the peace and friendship the treaties were meant to bring .

fisheries 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Chantal H é bert ' s column " Political dance on native rights " is only partially correct . 
she correctly states that eastern political parties are walking on eggshells but she fails to recognize why . 
my colleague from West Nova and myself as the member of parliament for South Shore understand the fragility of the licensed lobster fishery based on conservation . 
the reason this industry is lucrative is that lobster fishers have adopted licences , carapace sizes , trap limits and an inhospitable winter season to assure a quality product for domestic and export markets . 
this year one lobster fisherman in LFA 35 has been lost at sea . 
we can all see that the cost of being in the industry is extremely high . 
the Reform misled fishers into falsely believing that the decision can be struck down . 
the NDP has completely turned its back on eastern Canada . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
fisheries 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government needs to move quickly if it hopes to relieve tensions in New Brunswick and to prevent similar conflicts from happening in other parts of the country . 
the government has an obligation to all its citizens , not just to select groups . 
it cannot allow the courts to draw racial boundaries through Canada ' s natural resources . 
we have only two days left . 
why will not the government petition the supreme court not to overturn the decision but to stay the decision and then ask for clarification of this Marshall decision ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not see why the Reform Party is again using the term race . 
frankly that is not the way to approach this matter . 
we have to approach it on the basis that we are working together to find solutions which are fair to all concerned . 
why do we not have the support of the Reform Party in this direction rather their using the term race in this matter ? 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , because the government has failed to act we are forced to use the word race . 
by not petitioning the court it is ensuring that we will have a race based fishery in the future . 
most Canadians want equality of all citizens and groups . 
while both groups of fishermen have rights , both native and non - native fishermen , by not petitioning the court , by not asking for clarification , it is ensuring that one group of fishermen has superior rights over another . 
that is not right . 
what gives the government the right to unilaterally quash the principle of equality ? 
both groups of fishermen have rights . 
why not ask the court for clarification on that point ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the supreme court came down with a judgment on September 17 , 1999 . We as the government respect the treaty right and we will live within the spirit of that judgment . 
we have to make clear this is a right by law that the courts have recognized , a contract . 
the crown should respect the promises that it made whether they were made yesterday or whether they were made 240 years ago . 
we will ensure that we live with that . 
today I am happy to announce that I will be appointing a federal representative to start the talks immediately on a long term arrangement to deal with this issue . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the problem is about to get bigger . 
some native leaders now claim that the Marshall decision gives them the right to harvest timber without a licence . 
others claim that they now have mineral rights . 
if the minister does not think that is true , he just has to look at what has been going on in British Columbia all summer . 
i expect the minister may wish that this problem would go away . 
he only has two days left . 
i would urge him to petition the court . 
why will not the government ask the supreme court to stay the ruling , not overturn it , ask for clarification of its meaning , tell all fishermen that their livelihoods will be protected and establish a fisheries policy that has equality as its cornerstone ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what is really important today is that we will have a federal representative who will talk to aboriginal and non - aboriginal groups and sit down to make sure we look at the long term arrangement in the fisheries area . 
in terms of the broader issues , my colleague , the Indian affairs minister , is working very hard so that we can also deal with the broader issues that go beyond the fisheries as well . 
we are making excellent progress . 
why will not that party support that progress ? 
why will it not support aboriginal people and work with us instead of always trying to tear down what we are trying to build up ?

child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are outraged by the government ' s unwillingness to uphold the law against child pornography . 
i have already submitted 150,000 signatures on petitions calling for the government to uphold the law . 
today I will present another 150,000 . 
that is more than a quarter of a million people who have demonstrated their outrage against the government . 
yet the justice minister refuses to budge . 
children agenda my foot . 
how many more concerned Canadians will it take for this government to protect our kids ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member knows and as I think everyone on this side of the House is well aware , the government is committed to children and committed to a national children ' s agenda , unlike our hon. friends on the other side who are in the business of gunning programs that help families and children in the country . 
in relation to the issue of child pornography let me say that our friends on the other side are scaremongers . 
they suggest there are no pornography laws in force in the country . 
it is against the law to produce child pornography , to distribute it , to sell it , and to import it . 
i would ask the Reform Party , as opposed to - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry , but the hon. minister ' s time has expired . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
they are calling on the government to act . 
why is the government being led by nine judges , rather than - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. Minister of Justice . 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again the hon. member chooses to distort the facts . 
he refers to the Alberta case . 
what he fails to accentuate is that the accused person was convicted in that situation . 
convictions for possession of pornography are taking place all over the country . 
i have made it absolutely plain that we will respect the rule of law . 
we are - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Rimouski - Mitis .

GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Industry seems determined not to support the Government of Quebec ' s efforts to modernize the automobile industry in Quebec . 
does the minister realize that , by not backing Minister Landry ' s proposal , he is standing in the way of a plan that , on the one hand , will further the policy of developing new technologies in Quebec and , on the other , will make it possible to train a workforce specialized in this sector and keep it in Quebec ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will not repeat what my colleague , the Minister of Industry , said , because I might not be as eloquent . 
what he said was that the Quebec government is jumping the gun . 
together , we have decided to form a partnership so as to help GM ' s Boisbriand division . 
at this point , I think that everyone agrees that the most important thing is to help the Boisbriand plant find a new model . 
this was the focus of discussions . 
my colleague and I also participated in the study done by the survival committee , and we went to Detroit . 
we are available and will continue to support employees of GM ' s Boisbriand plant . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , more speechifying from the government , but we have nothing concrete to show for it . 
the minister says that the plan is irresponsible and poorly thought out , but the federal government is hardly close to the action . 
does Quebec ' s plan bother the federal government so much that it is prepared to sacrifice Boisbriand for the 14 plants in Ontario ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebec ' s plan does not necessarily bother the federal government , but it should bother Quebec taxpayers . 
at this stage , the important thing is to come up with a new model . 
it is well known that if we can , as a partnership , come up with a new model , the odds are good that GM will not need government assistance , given what happened in the other provinces . 
but now that the Government of Quebec has tipped its hand , there will obviously be no turning back , should a new model later be found . 
the $ 360 million is already on the table and probably ill - advisedly .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this morning the Journal de Montr é al reports that the Montreal urban community police department just completed an investigation on a production company that allegedly falsified the identity of some screen writers and unduly benefited from federal tax credits . 
the newspaper adds that the production company has also been the target of an RCMP investigation . 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
can the minister assure us that she will do her utmost to shed light on this issue , even if some people close to the Liberal party might be directly involved ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I myself found out about the investigation this morning . 
i believe the investigation is still going on and we should let the police do its job . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the minister presumably made some checks , can she confirm that the production company CINAR , which is a contributor to the Liberal Party of Canada and which is headed by Micheline Charest , who is said to have organized a fundraising evening for the Liberal Party of Canada that was attended by the Prime Minister , is not the target of this investigation ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not have any discussions with anyone about the investigation , because it is a police investigation . 
i respect that and I do not get involved in police matters . 
* * * 
agriculture 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister of agriculture . 
yesterday the minister told his counterparts in Manitoba and Saskatchewan that they had to put up some money for the farm crisis themselves . 
that is like asking the farmers to pay for their own crisis as R . B . Bennett did in the 1930 s . 
the minister knows that in Saskatchewan there is a joint position of all parties in the farm groups asking for an additional $ 1 billion in emergency farm aid now , on top of what they already have from last year under AIDA . 
will the minister be forthcoming with that money since he took money out of the programs by eliminating the Crow a few years ago ? 
how much money will come back to the farmers on the prairies ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I did have a very frank and candid discussion with the ministers from Saskatchewan and Manitoba yesterday . 
as they already know agriculture is a shared jurisdiction . 
the safety net support to agriculture for the last numbers of years has been shared 60:40 . 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister is obviously not listening . 
i have a letter from a 14 year old girl in Carragana , Saskatchewan . She is saying that nobody in parliament is listening to her on the farm crisis . 
i wonder if the minister could answer my question directly as to whether or not there will be an extra $ 1 billion going to hard pressed farmers on the prairies . 
would he screw up his courage and come out to the prairies to see for himself the severity of the crisis ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have been out to the prairies and I have seen it for myself . 
i have farmed for a number of years and I know the stress the producers are going through . 
in answer to the specific question , is there another $ 1 billion for the province of Saskatchewan on top of the programs and the money that are already there , no .

fisheries 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we welcome the news that the federal government would appoint a federal negotiator in the Atlantic fisheries crisis . 
it is indeed regrettable that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans can no longer be directly involved in negotiations to settle a fisheries management dispute . 
would the minister agree that the appointment of the negotiator was necessary only because he and his senior bureaucrats have lost all credibility with the people involved ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is total rubbish . 
i know Mr. James MacKenzie who is from Nova Scotia will do an excellent job to make sure we sit down , get all the parties together , and have a long term arrangement . 
meanwhile we have a regulatory fishery out there . 
we are ensuring that we have interim agreements , but this should not reflect on our long term arrangement . 
that is why Mr. MacKenzie has been asked . 
i am very happy that someone of his calibre has accepted this position . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is not total rubbish . 
it is total chaos which the minister has created . 
on Monday , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will be meeting with native leaders in Ottawa . 
the fact that the meeting is taking place in Ottawa is just another slap in the face to Atlantic Canadians . 
we would like to know why the ministers are hiding away in Ottawa . 
why can they not go to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and meet these people where the problem really is ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have been to Atlantic Canada before the hon. member even knew the issue existed . 
i met with all the commercial groups . 
i met with the aboriginal groups . 
we have been working with them . 
we will be willing to meet with them . 
it is extremely important that we sit down to ensure that the aboriginal communities can exercise their treaty rights for the benefit of their members . 
we are going to continue to do that .

immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I talked to the immigration officials in B.C. and they informed me that only four of the 600 Chinese migrants have gone through their initial IRB hearings . 
do the math . 
at this rate the initial hearings of the 600 Chinese migrants will not be completed until 2034 . 
the minister assured Canadians that extra resources would be dedicated to expedite the process . 
is this the minister ' s idea of expedience ? 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear on this question . 
the government has acted and is acting to expedite the process . 
let me further inform the member . 
he knows that the issue we are dealing with is an international one which involves the smuggling of human beings . 
the member knows that this country is one of the leaders in the fight internationally . 
the member knows that but he is trying to exploit it . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , even if the minister manages to get the initial hearings completed in a year , the appeals process will take years . 
these people will spend a significant portion of their lives in detention camps set up by the government . 
i find this to be unacceptable . 
further , every Canadian knows that the longer the process takes , the more it is going to cost taxpayers . 
i want the minister to tell Canadians how much it is going to cost taxpayers to complete this process . 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear for the Reform Party . 
this government is acting expeditiously . 
in a speech in the House a few minutes ago before question period a Reform member said that if the Reform Party were the government it would deal with the issue in days or a matter of weeks . 
we know that we cannot have justice in a day or a matter of weeks unless we have adjudicators of a commandant form and we are not going to have them . 
* * * 
air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Onex affair , one of the minister ' s conditions is Canadian control of the future air carrier . 
the present Canadian International Airlines - American Airlines agreement gives American veto power in any major decisions , including a potential merger with Air Canada . 
the law limits foreign control of a Canadian carrier to no more than 25 % . 
by blocking any Air Canada offer , American has de facto control over Canadian International Airlines . 
can we trust the minister to respect these five conditions , when he is not even ensuring respect of the present legislation ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , the Canadian Transportation Agency is mandated to examine the conditional agreement accepted by Air Canada ' s shareholders . 
and I have no doubts that the agency will protect the interests of Canadians , and that it will protect the Canadian industry so that it will be operated by Canadians in Canada . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , according to the minister , if section 47 was applied , it was because time was of the essence , since Canadian International Airlines was on the verge of bankruptcy . 
yet the presidents of Canadian International Airlines , American Airlines and Onex all say that Canadian International Airlines will not be going bankrupt in the near future . 
who is telling the truth ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there have been no changes in the arguments that led the government to invoke section 47 . 
i believe the hon. member has raised a good question but , with all due respect , I suggest he raise it with Mr. Benson during the transport committee meetings if he wants the right answer .

agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today we have found out that there is no new money for western Canadian farmers who got nothing from AIDA . 
the minister of agriculture has been quoted in the Western Producer as saying that government could help farmers by offering retraining for a new career . 
does he not realize that the average age of farmers in Saskatchewan is 59 ? 
what career does he think is appropriate for a 59 year old farmer who has lost everything ? 
follow his path and take up politics ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this government has shown very clearly that we care for Canadian farmers to a greater extent than the party across the floor . 
during the summer we made changes to the NISA program to make another $ 121 million available to Canadian farmers . 
we have encouraged them to use those programs . 
we have made changes to the crop insurance program . 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as an emergency assistance program , AIDA has been a cruel joke . 
after almost a year of Liberal fiddling , only a fraction of allocated funds has trickled down to desperate prairie farmers . 
the minister said that money is on the table . 
money on the table is not in farmers ' pockets . 
the worst feature of the program is that to qualify , a farmer has to have three profitable years immediately prior to 1998 . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think it is sad that the hon. member said that $ 900 million from the federal government and $ 600 million from the provincial government is a cruel joke . 
it is a significant sum of money . 
i can assure the hon. member that all of that money will be spent to assist Canadian farmers .

east TIMOR 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister . 
six weeks after the referendum in East Timor , no Canadian soldiers have yet joined the implementation force on the ground . 
our soldiers are still waiting for their inoculations , which they were late receiving , to take effect . 
how does the Deputy Prime Minister explain such a delay , when the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself was warned by NGOs returning from East Timor that there would be a blood bath ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all we do have troops in East Timor . 
they have taken humanitarian aid . 
they have been going in and out of East Timor . 
they have had one of the highest levels of use of transport aircraft of any of the allied countries involved . 
today our troops in Valcartier are on their way to East Timor . 
they will be training with the New Zealanders and going in at the same time as the New Zealanders . 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is all very fine and well but , in the throne speech , the government said that Canada has the expertise to protect people from threats to their rights , their safety and their lives . 
does the Deputy Prime Minister think that Canada ' s slowness to act is consistent with the policy of human safety advanced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the only reason the ground troops have not been in there earlier is because of the need for inoculation from a very deadly disease . 
would the hon. member have us send our troops in and risk their lives ? 
no , we would not do that . 
we want to make sure they are properly protected to be of service to the people of East Timor . 
the Australians are very anxious for us to get there . 
we are getting there just as quickly as we can . 
we will get there at the same time as the New Zealanders and they are right next door .

agriculture 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Alberta government recognized the worst farm crisis in Canada since the Great Depression by announcing a $ 100 million emergency farm program . 
a disaster income program whose criteria are so tough that farmers cannot access the money . 
i suggest that is the real disaster , the government ' s program . 
what will it take for the minister to wake up and realize that farmers are in a very serious crisis ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we know a number of farmers are having very stressful financial times presently . 
that is why we put the program in place . 
as I said a few minutes ago , the criteria will trigger all of the $ 900 million of federal money and the $ 600 million of the 60:40 split of the money we announced earlier this year . 
* * * 
trade 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is another example of how western farmers are getting the shaft from the government . 
western cattle producers facing a 6 % tariff from the Americans spent their own money to travel to the U.S. to hammer out proposals to end the dispute . 
but the trade and agriculture ministers refuse to listen and do nothing to defend the farmers . 
will the the minister act immediately to implement the ranchers ' solutions which they hammered out to end this discrimination tariff ? 
Mr. Bob Speller ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should know that when the decision came down it was a win for Canada . 
we won a lot of this decision and the hon. member should be happy with that . 
before we sat down and before we put forward the Canadian position on this , we talked to the groups , the industry and the provinces to make sure the position being put forward by the Government of Canada was best reflective of their views . 
we will continue to do that . 
* * * 
audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister just told us she did not contact the police . 
can she also confirm that no member of her staff or her department was in touch with police forces involved in the investigation into the Montreal production company ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I read in the newspaper that Canadian Audio - Visual Certification Office officials are meeting with Revenue Canada , next Thursday . 
so I presume public servants have been in touch with the police . 
* * * 
health RESEARCH 
Mr. Mark Assad ( Gatineau , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health . 
the government recently made some interesting announcements in the area of research . 
i am thinking in particular of the Canadian institutes of health research mentioned in the budget , and of the announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister concerning university chairs . 
could the minister give us an example of funding for university research ? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for Gatineau for his interesting question . 
over the coming weeks and months , we will have the opportunity to discuss the issues of research chairs and institutes of health research . 
at this point , I would like to remind the House that , last month , the Minister of Health and his colleague , the Minister of National Revenue , announced an $ 11.7 million subsidy for health research to the Universit é de Montr éal. 
that money will be used to conduct research on AIDS , cancer and ethical issues relating to genetic changes . 
* * * 
taxation 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are saying that taxes are far too high . 
Cheryl in Burlington wrote to the Minister of Finance this summer and said : " As a stay at home mother of four small children the tax system is unfair . 
we are penalized because we believe that we are best to care for our children , not daycare '' . 
when will tax discrimination which puts purchased daycare over parent care end ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is obviously not aware of the national child tax benefit by which the government put untold millions of dollars into the hands of families . 
it was precisely for middle income families . 
we do recognize the costs incurred by those who have to raise children . 
the real issue is why the Reform opposed the national child tax benefit . 
that is the main issue . 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister has it wrong again . 
he did not answer the question . 
i would like to invest and expand my business but because of heavy tax I have decided to sell out and move '' . 
how is any entrepreneur going to be persuaded to invest in the country when the tax burden is literally breaking the back of small business ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again the hon. member ought to check his facts . 
the fact is we have cut unemployment insurance premiums by $ 4 billion . 
that affects small business immediately . 
we have put money into the small business loans program . 
we had a team Canada mission helping small business export across the country . 
the fact is that the government recognizes that small business is the major job creator in the country and we have supported it to the hilt . 
i will go back . 
the hon. member says that I do not answer questions . 
why did he not answer the question on why the Reform Party opposed the national child tax benefit ? 
* * * 
canada CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
where will the money come from : our pensioners or all the northerners who have been so heavily audited recently ? 
what can possibly justify this $ 1.4 million tax party ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the amount referred to by the hon. member is wrong . 
i will tell the member one more time that the November 1 event will launch the new Canada Customs and Revenue Agency . 
we feel it is worth proceeding with some celebration because , together with our employees and our unions , we are working toward having an agency that will be more client oriented . 
as a government , we are proud of this agency . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government will not honour pay equity . 
there is a farm crisis . 
we have first nations people in the country who go hungry . 
will this new tax agency do what it wants , when it wants with our money ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe the Speech from the Throne has stated quite eloquently what the government has done and what it will do in the near future . 
with regard to the new Canada Customs and Revenue Agency , I told the member that we are very proud of what we are doing . 
this agency will provide much better services to the population . 
we are providing good services now but we want to do much better in the near future .

standing COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a week before the first meeting of the transport committee , the National Post and the the Globe and Mail reported that the Minister of Transport had selected the member for Hamilton West to be elected as the new chair of the committee , even though there had not been a meeting . 
yesterday , right on schedule , all the Liberal members on the committee voted just like the minister predicted they would . 
will the minister commit to respect the committee system and honour the system not preordained - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that while the question may be of interest it does not fall within the administrative competence of the government . 
it is out of order . 
does the hon. member have a supplementary question ? 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , you are probably right , it is out of order because the minister is supposed to stay out of committee affairs . 
committees are supposed to answer to parliament but the minister preordained the vote in a committee meeting . 
i am asking the minister to commit to never doing that again , allow the committee to do its work - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that the hon. member is in as much trouble with his supplementary as he was with the one that he admitted was out of order at the beginning . 
the hon. member for St. Paul ' s .

crime PREVENTION 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Justice . 
on Tuesday the Speech from the Throne said the government would work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe . 
could the minister tell us what initiatives the government has taken to help communities deal with crime ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this gives me the opportunity to share with the House the remarkable success of a program that we on this side of the House are very proud of . 
that is , of course , our crime prevention strategy . 
we on this side of the House believe that one only delivers real public safety and security through an integrated approach to the issue of crime , unlike the hon. members in the Reform Party who seem to believe in simply putting more people in jail for longer . 
on this side of the House we believe in working in communities , with communities in partnership to address the root cause of crime . 
* * * 
taxation 
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , further on high taxes , in a letter to the Minister of Finance , Clinton from Dartmouth wrote , " I ' m part of the working poor . 
instead of creating useless programs , do me a real favour and give me some real tax relief . 
p . S . I want more than just a couple of hundred bucks . 
and get rid of bracket creep while you are at it '' . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
yes , Mr. Speaker , approximately $ 4 billion this year , $ 16.5 billion over the next three years , the most significant tax cuts the country has seen in over a decade . 
that is the answer .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is again for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
can the minister confirm whether or not members of her political staff in her office have contacted the police forces involved in the investigations on a production company from Montreal ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , no one from my office gets involved in a police investigation . 
* * * 
auto PACT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister who is one of the few members of parliament who was here when the auto pact came into being . 
he was probably here as well when parliament and Canadians were assured that the auto pact would not be endangered by the WTO . 
given the number of jobs that are threatened by the WTO decision , many in his home city of Windsor , what does the government plan to do to safeguard the auto pact and the tens of thousands of jobs that are associated with that managed trade ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased the hon. member has recognized what Liberal governments have done over the years to build the auto industry . 
this endorsement by the NDP will be listened to carefully by people in Windsor and other automotive cities . 
i assure the hon. member that we are looking very carefully at the interim ruling which has been received in confidence . 
we will be making our representations to the WTO with respect to what should be in any final ruling and we will act in our responsibilities as we always have to protect the interests of Canadian workers - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Richmond - Arthabaska .

intergovernmental AFFAIRS 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with things as they are in Quebec at this time , the scenario of a third referendum seems rather vague , despite the continuity of the Liberal government ' s hard line . 
now a number of people are contemplating a new type of scenario , which could comprise a referendum on the new offers Quebec might make to Canada . 
my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
is the minister going to prepare a plan A and / or plan B for this new scenario , and is he open to such an exercise originating with Quebec ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I would like to thank the Progressive Conservative intergovernmental relations critic for his question . 
i believe that when such issues are at stake , it is very important for us to limit to a minimum any disagreement between the parties that believe in Canada . 
the hon. member has certainly realized that a referendum is not necessary in order to improve Canada , to improve our highly decentralized federation . 
he has certainly realized that Quebecers , like all Canadians , do not want to be thrown into the upheaval of a referendum and he knows that , if ever there was a government that would have no credibility for this type of initiative , it is the present separatist government . 
* * * 
global POPULATION 
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past week the world welcomed its sixth billionth citizen . 
by year 2050 the world ' s population will be 8.9 billion . 
our global ecosystems and economies cannot continue to support this growing population forever . 
my question is for the Minister of International Cooperation . 
what is the government doing to help alleviate problems associated with global population ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as members know , almost all of the population growth is taking place in developing countries , aggravating the issues of poverty and social tensions in those areas . 
however , much of CIDA ' s programming is devoted to supporting women in developing countries , including their quality of life , as well as targeting funding for reproductive health programming . 
i would also like to point out that we do a great deal of work with girl child education . 
in fact , if 1,000 girls were given the opportunity to go to school for one extra year only , it would save 60 children . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , so much for another Liberal infomercial . 
the Liberal government has clearly failed to fix the broken immigration system . 
this week we learned that some of the ringleaders of the west coast people smuggling ships will not be prosecuted . 
the minister assured Canadians that people smugglers would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . 
this is an important question and hopefully a junior secretary will not get up to answer it . 
why has the government gone back on its word to prosecute these people smuggling criminals ? 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me thank the assistant critic for the Reform Party on immigration for the question . 
let me further say to to the member that our values as a government in dealing with the very serious problem of people smuggling are not the same as the Reform Party ' s values . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Transport has admitted that he is letting corporate shareholders decide the future of the Canadian airline industry . 
instead of showing leadership , he is sitting in his office waiting for Gerry Schwartz to give him a call to tell him what to do . 
this is a shameful abdication of his duty in a vital part of Canada ' s infrastructure . 
will the minister do his duty and table specific conditions for an airline merger before the Air Canada shareholders ' meeting , or is he going to wait until after the meeting when Gerry gives him a call and tells him what to do ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is true that we are waiting for the shareholders of Air Canada to pronounce upon various proposals that either come along or will come along . 
the market will decide on the corporate structuring , but the market alone will not decide on air policy for Canadians . 
the members of the House , the Senate and the government will decide what is in the public interest and what conditions have to be put on any agreement that comes forward . 
that is a way that airline policy will be guaranteed for all Canadians . 
* * * 
trucking INDUSTRY 
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , problems in the trucking industry have been in the news a lot lately . 
we know that nearly 80 % of trucking movement is interprovincial , meaning that it comes under federal jurisdiction . 
we also know that the National Transportation Act will be deregulated in January 2000 . 
my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
will he tell us what his plans are for eliminating the chaos in the trucking industry ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , how interesting that the Bloc Quebecois wants the federal government to interfere . 
what I can say is that appeals from truckers are already before the CLRB . 
we must wait for the board ' s decisions . 
* * * 
intergovernmental AFFAIRS 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs did not really answer my question . 
what we want to know is how open the government would be to any change that might come from the regions or provinces , specifically from Quebec . 
what plan A or plan B would it introduce if a region , or a province or provinces , held a referendum on major changes within the federation ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the question is too hypothetical to answer . 
all that can be said is that , with respect to the present Government of Quebec , Premier Bouchard said during the last election campaign that he was not in the business of renewing federalism . 
this statement was repeated yesterday by Quebec ' s Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
the Government of Quebec therefore has no credibility on this score . 
in any event , Quebecers , like all Canadians , do not want a referendum . 
i therefore expect governments to listen to Quebecers as they would listen to all Canadians . 
* * * 
justice 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a recent survey of 450 Canadian judges found that 80 % of them are so skeptical about the way conditional sentences are handled that they are leery of handing them out . 
many cited inadequate supervision for the offenders as their main concern . 
if criminals cannot be supervised , public safety cannot be assured . 
when will the justice minister change the sentencing laws to ensure that violent criminals are ineligible for conditional sentences ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I have said on a number of occasions in this House , five cases were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada on this very issue some months ago . 
we are now awaiting the decision of the supreme court . 
i have made it plain that after the decision of the supreme court is rendered , if changes are required to the conditional sentencing laws in this country , they will be made . 
i am also awaiting the report of the justice committee in relation to conditional sentencing .

the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that the bill is in the same state as the previous bill , as indicated by the government House leader and , accordingly , the bill stands in the same position it would have been at the time of prorogation of the last session .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise on behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to introduce my private member ' s bill in the House today . 
the bill would establish a minimum two year sentence for second or subsequent convictions for the break and enter of dwelling houses . 
Canadians view the crime of break and enter as more than just a property crime . 
they view it as a crime against the person . 
it is my hope that this private member ' s bill will receive support from my colleagues so we can effectively address this national problem .

i am looking forward to strong support for this bill for the benefit of our grassroots natives who are suffering a great deal on our reserves .

witness AND SPOUSAL PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to reintroduce my private member ' s bill that I call the new identities act . 
each year in Canada hundreds of women and children live in fear for their lives . 
many women go into hiding , leaving behind their jobs , families and friends in order to cover their trail to hide from an abusive , violent spouse . 
unfortunately , many are found and beaten , and some are even killed . 
if passed , this bill will serve to formally protect those persons whose lives are in danger by bringing them into the witness protection system . 
this summer I contacted over 500 shelters and organizations across Canada for their input on this bill . 
in return I received an incredible amount of support , constructive suggestions and , most importantly , the horrific stories that necessitate this bill . 
we as parliamentarians must address the crisis of domestic violence and through the new identities program provide an escape for threatened individuals who have nowhere else to turn . 
i hope that members on all sides of the House will give this bill the non - partisan support it deserves .

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Rural Development ) ( Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario ) , Lib . ) : 
this is a very exciting time in the history of our country . 
the Speech from the Throne is the last for this millennium and lays out the government ' s vision as we move into an exciting era of the 21 st century . 
our agenda will create opportunity and prosperity for Canadians no matter where they live . 
one of every three Canadians lives outside a major centre , whether it is a small community near an urban centre or a more remote community , be it a farming town , a forestry or mining community , or one based on tourism or manufacturing . 
the government recognizes the special circumstances of rural Canadians and it specifically addressed rural Canada in its Speech from the Throne . 
Hailing as I do from a rural area of central and northern Ontario , I have seen firsthand the dynamism of our rural areas , our towns , our villages and the entrepreneurialism and energy of those who live there . 
the Speech from the Throne has clearly laid out the direction in which the government intends to go in the coming months . 
this direction applies very much to rural Canada . 
we have made a commitment to encourage the development and adaptation of new technologies , recognizing that they hold the promise of greater economic stability for rural communities traditionally dominated by single industries like mining , fishing , forestry , or agriculture . 
in other words , investments in new technologies are a critical tool in the bid to strengthen rural communities and enable them to break out of the cyclical economies . 
we will make those investments . 
the government has also committed to work with its partners in other levels of government , in the private sector , in the voluntary sector and with citizens in general to build a better quality of life for Canadians everywhere . 
as the Speech from the Throne indicated , this includes rural Canadians . 
i would like to point out that my appointment as Secretary of State for Rural Development is in itself a strong signal of the importance the government attaches to rural Canada . 
the purpose of creating a separate additional Secretary of State for Rural Development is to bolster and reinforce the government ' s focus on rural Canada . 
i am deeply honoured to serve in that position . 
in my new role I plan to lead the government ' s efforts in improving the quality of life for Canadians who live in rural and remote Canada . 
i intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the House . 
most important , I intend to work with individual Canadians to ensure that we take a co - ordinated approach to rural Canada and that we work together for common priorities which have been identified by rural Canadians themselves . 
in the months ahead I will be concentrating on three particular areas . 
first is the rural lens . 
this is essentially a way of making sure the potential impact on rural Canada is taken into consideration before federal policy decisions are made . 
second is to help Canadians who live outside our cities have better access to all the resources that are available to them . 
that means making sure they know what programs and services are out there , as well as making sure they are able to use them . 
the third area I will be focusing on is the task of turning our strong commitments into specific tangible actions that truly help rural citizens . 
as I have said , rural Canadians face many challenges , a number of them quite similar from community to community , for example , the challenges presented by distance from markets , low population density and the cyclical nature of resource based industries . 
depending on where one lives in rural Canada , whether it is a remote Newfoundland outport , a small rural municipality in Saskatchewan , or a community in the far north , circumstances and cultures can also be quite different . 
the Government of Canada is committed to reflecting those differences and those realities in our policy decisions . 
in adopting the principle of the rural lens , cabinet has made a commitment to ensure that the challenges and priorities of rural Canadians are understood and taken into account , both in current initiatives and in long term planning . 
as Secretary of State for Rural Development , I look forward to the opportunity to work with my cabinet colleagues in applying the rural lens . 
this brings me back to my second priority which is to improve the communications and information flow between the government and rural citizens . 
as well as sharpening our focus on rural concerns within the government , it is also critically important that we do more to let rural Canadians know what assistance or programming is already available . 
we have made a good start . 
one key way of doing this is by producing an annual report which measures our achievements in dealing with rural issues and challenges . 
not only is the government committed to helping rural Canadians , it also expects to be held accountable for doing so . 
early next year I will table this report in parliament , thereby providing an opportunity both for my colleagues in the House of Commons and for all Canadians to engage in a public discussion on how we chart the future of rural Canada . 
developing rural Canada and assisting rural Canadians will be a transparent process , one that is bottom up and not top down driven . 
more than that it will be an opportunity to discuss our successes , our challenges , our vision , and most important the specific actions we need to take to ensure the future of rural Canada . 
the third area I want to talk about and the most important part of what I am charged to do relates to specific actions to be taken to bring about tangible developments and improvements for rural Canadians . 
the direction set out in the Speech from the Throne will guide us as we work to deliver the results in rural Canada . 
our focus must now shift from process to results to take the steps necessary to develop action items into specific deliverables in rural Canada and make concrete progress on the priorities of rural Canadians . 
in some cases this may simply mean bringing together different departments that do similar programs to focus resources in one area . 
in other cases we may need something new in addition to what is already being undertaken . 
for example , Health Canada through the office of rural health is taking the lead on the development of a rural health strategy to ensure that Canadians in rural and remote areas have access to quality health care . 
in another initiative a number of service Canada projects are being tried out in rural areas as a possible way to improve access to government programs and services . 
before closing I would like to mention that I wear another hat , that of Secretary of State for Federal Economic Development Initiative in Northern Ontario , more commonly known as the FedNor program . 
that brings with it a responsibility for community futures which plays a role in providing access to capital and facilitating business development for rural Canadians . 
the community futures development corporations are administered by four different entities within the federal government : three regional development agencies , plus Industry Canada . 
the program works very well . 
it is an excellent example of one community level program which works across several different agencies , yet is very rurally focused . 
over the next few weeks I will be discussing with my ministerial colleagues other co - operative initiatives that involve their departments or agencies . 
those initiatives will be directly targeted at the priorities set forward in the Speech from the Throne , and the federal framework for action in rural Canada which rural Canadians themselves helped to write and helped to develop . 
the Speech from the Throne lays out a vision and opportunity for prosperity for Canadians . 
it is my personal commitment to ensure that rural Canadians are equal partners in that vision , that they have the technologies , the tools and the infrastructure to build a better quality of life for their chosen communities . 
rural Canada is the foundation on which a large part of our economic wealth is built . 
it is a place of great energy and great ingenuity . 
it is our past , it is our present and it is our future . 
it is a way of life , a way of unique traditions and a specific social structure . 
most important , rural Canada is home . 
it is home to my family and other members ' families . 
this government is working to make sure that that future for rural Canadians is as bright as possible . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , my question for the minister is a very simple one . 
he speaks of the nine million Canadians who live in rural Canada . 
i think he has tried very gallantly to revise the biggest single omission in the throne speech and that is the fact that there was no mention of agriculture . 
the AIDA and NISA programs simply do not meet their needs . 
some of those programs are based on 70 % of the last three years ' earnings . 
in my riding the last three years have been disastrous due to the drought . 
of course , 70 % of nothing is nothing . 
for farmers who are facing this crisis and bankruptcy there was absolutely nothing in the throne speech . 
the minister speaks about rural issues . 
one of the most pivotal and important issues for rural Canadians is agriculture and food output . 
the throne speech did not address that . 
that is a significant concern . 
the minister does not address that . 
the minister spoke at length about e - commerce , the growth in the high tech sector and the importance of connectedness in terms of technology in rural communities . 
i share with him in his optimism that in the long term these may play a role . 
however , does he really believe that the government ' s focus on e - commerce and on Internet connectedness for rural communities is going to help ? 
does he really believe in the short term that a 50 year old farmer who is facing bankruptcy is going to be turned into a computer programmer or a high tech worker and suddenly will be transported back from the edge of the abyss of poverty , despair and into some new e - world of prosperity and future potential ? 
i believe he is being very naive and that the government is being very cold - hearted in turning its back on rural Canada and particularly on the agricultural sector , both in the west , in Ontario and in the east . 
hon. Andy Mitchell : 
madam Speaker , part of what we see here , from the comments made by the hon. member who represents the Tory Party , is a good example of how its inability to deal with two separate issues at the same time led to an administration in the country from 1984 to 1993 that resulted in record deficits , increased unemployment and lower economic growth . 
the reality is that we are dealing with all the issues that the hon. member mentioned . 
he talked about nothing being done in terms of the farm income prices . 
that work is ongoing and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food has indicated his willingness to continue to work with his provincial counterparts , with the industry and with others to do the things that are necessary to help . 
beyond just simply helping in the income crisis , as important as that is , we must also ensure the long term viability of rural Canada . 
we cannot just simply deal with the issues of the day , although we must and it is important . 
we must also ensure the long term viability of rural Canada and rural Canadians . 
we must make sure that there is a future for rural Canadians . 
we must make sure there is a future for our children so that they can choose to live in rural Canada . 
it means more than simply identifying or dealing with one specific industry . 
it means more than just simply identifying with any one specific problem . 
it means dealing with the broad issues that face rural Canadians . 
it means understanding that rural Canada has separate challenges and separate needs and to respond to them . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
i would invite him to speak to the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
with his responsibility for rural areas he is surely aware that , since employment insurance reform , there has been a serious problem that has to do with the rule of intensity . 
yesterday , the Minister of Human Resources Development gave an interview to a Moncton newspaper . 
she thinks that the rule of intensity must not be done away with , nor the period of benefits extended , because that is no solution . 
more employment must be created , and seasonal employment must be enabled to last longer . 
i say to the secretary of state and to the minister " Why not do both at the same time ? " 
when they state that the industry ' s season must be lengthened , it is as if they were telling people " You are not working longer because you do not want to . " 
the Secretary of State for Rural Development must surely know , and I hope he agrees with that view , that there is no one in Canada who does not want to work . 
this is not a situation where , contrary to what the Prime Minister said in the past , the unemployed are beer drinkers . 
that has been demonstrated . 
there are no more cheaters among the unemployed than there are in multinationals or elsewhere . 
generally speaking , people do want to work . 
it is not by hitting them on the head or by imposing unacceptable rules regarding minimum income that things will change . 
in rural areas , when a person works 15 or 20 weeks , if that person does not collect enough benefits , even if he or she has a job , even if he or she is among those who worked during the year , that person will still get poor because we do not have a good employment insurance program . 
so , will the Secretary of State for Rural Development make representations to the Minister of Human Resources Development to have that situation changed , and is he not deeply upset that the throne speech says nothing on this issue ? 
will the secretary of state do that in the years to come ? 
hon. Andy Mitchell : 
madam Speaker , I had the opportunity as the chair of the natural resources committee to author a report called " Think Rural " which outlined many of the issues in rural Canada . 
even though the hon. member was not a member of that committee , he took the time , effort and energy to provide input into the development of that report . 
he is committed to his rural area . 
in terms of the issues in HRDC , I know that he and the minister have had debates in the House and that they continue to have discussions . 
the member forgets to talk about the other parts of the HRDC regime . 
he forgets to talk about active measures and all the other labour market adjustment type of initiatives that are undertaken by HRDC and which certainly help rural areas . 
i had the opportunity not too long ago to travel to his part of the country . 
there was a concern about improving the quality of life of rural Canadians no matter where they live . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I , like some of my other colleagues , will begin by pointing out to Canadians and to the members of the House an issue that was not addressed in the Speech from the Throne : the state of Canada ' s airline industry . 
we were all inundated over the summer months with positions both for and against changes in the airline industry but the government remains silent . 
there was absolutely no mention in the throne speech of the crisis in the airline industry . 
it is very clear that major changes will be coming . 
these are the questions I have . 
where is the government ' s vision for the future of the Canadian airline industry ? 
where does the government feel Canadians want to see the airline industry go ? 
it is the government ' s apparent lack of vision that causes concern . 
the government seems to always be responding or reacting to situations rather than working out some of the problems or finding solutions in advance . 
unfortunately its history of popping up into the issues and trying to influence the private sector is usually done for the wrong reasons . 
once the dust settles over the current airline industry situation , government and parliament must work together in a non - partisan fashion . 
we must work together with the stakeholders to develop a clear blueprint for Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century . 
i do not think there is a Canadian who has not heard of Onex , Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International . 
Canadians accept the fact that Canadian Airlines International is in trouble . 
i think everyone is aware of the Onex offer to merge the two airlines to stabilize Canada ' s airline industry under one major airline . 
i do not think there are many Canadians , and I am one of them , who are aware of what Air Canada ' s counterproposal may be . 
however , I would suggest that one way or another it looks like we will only have one national airline in Canada . 
more importantly , parliament must play a role and it must be done in a non - partisan fashion . 
the Reform Party believes that the role of government should be to facilitate a private enterprise solution to this problem . 
that means less government regulation not more . 
it means that the government must establish the priority of protecting the interests of Canadian consumers at both the national and regional levels , the interests of the Canadian taxpayer , the interests of the airline employees and the interests of those who invest in Canada ' s airline industry . 
maybe a starting point would be a comparison with the airline industry in Australia . 
it is interesting that in Australia where the demographics and the geography is very similar to Canada and where it has similar concerns and issues that Australia can have two profitable national airlines . 
maybe there is something that we can learn from Australia ' s airline industry . 
we also have to look at what role this government and previous Liberal and Conservative governments played in bringing our airline industry to the point where it is today . 
more importantly , the issue we have to address is how to fix the problem . 
i will move on from the airline industry because there are other transportation issues in the country that must be addressed . 
canada is on the brink of entering a new century . 
the brief mention of infrastructure programs in the throne speech leaves a lot of questions in the air . 
it mentions that the federal government will work with the provinces and the private sector over the next year to develop a new five year plan for improving the infrastructure . 
i think that is very short sighted of the government and of our country . 
we have to take a much larger and longer vision of where we want to go with our infrastructure and on how we are going to get there . 
we would be remiss if we were not looking in ten 20 - year cycles as opposed to only looking five years down the road . 
not only is that true for our infrastructure program but it is also true for our national highway system . 
government has studied the problem of Canada ' s highway system for years . 
it really is time to quit studying and to do something about it . 
it is important for rural Canada , it is important for urban Canada and it is important for the well being of all Canadians that our transportation networks are sound , well planned and certainly in good condition . 
one of the issues that is very dear to my heart is the issue of trade corridors . 
a large part of the reason for Canada ' s economic improvement over the last years is due to the massive increase in trade , mainly with the Americans . 
i do not know that Canadians understand or realize that over $ 1.5 billion worth of trade happens across the Canada - U.S. border every single day of the year . 
it is not just good enough to have trade agreements . 
it is not just good enough to have agreements among countries and documents that are signed between the leaders . 
we have to be able to move the goods that we have agreed to trade . 
we have to make sure that the movement of those goods is done in an efficient and timely manner . 
i do not think we can ignore rail transportation , particularly the movement of grain across our country . 
that has been an issue for a number years and it remains an issue that has to be resolved . 
two reports have been produced for parliament to consider , the Estey and Kroeger reports . 
i look forward to the coming years and seeing this happen . 
there are also environmental concerns . 
if the Minister of Environment is concerned about vehicle emissions then I would suggest that he go to any major commercial border crossing . 
it is time to address some of these issues . 
more important , the government ' s plan of talking with the provinces about highways is not just good enough . 
we need to develop a seamless transportation system involving our highways , our railways , our waterways and skies to move goods and people in the most efficient manner not on a national basis but on a continental - wide basis . 
only then can we ensure that we are looking after the health , safety and economic well - being of all Canadians . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
they are few and far between , but it highlighted the ones it thought were important . 
there was nothing in the speech but a reiteration of the fact that the government was putting $ 11.5 billion into health care over the next several years . 
that is totally insufficient . 
they would like to have seen something in that regard . 
also the government seems to have recognized that it has been fumbling the first nations accountability issue . 
the throne speech mentioned that the government wanted to foster accountability on the part of elected officials on our first nations . 
the Indian affairs minister has said in speeches privately in Saskatchewan that was one of the government ' s objectives . 
it is certainly worth recognizing that . 
physical infrastructure work was mentioned with regard to what I assume will be roads . 
this may have a benefit for farmers if the physical infrastructure it is talking about enables roads to be built sufficient to carry the large trucks which are now necessary to carry grain from the farmers field to the inland terminals and out to port by rail . 
a couple of points in the throne speech were scary for farmers . 
certainly we are concerned about the government ' s intentions with regard to its Kyoto commitment and how they will impact upon the government . 
the government is in the process of closing that research station . 
in fact it has virtually closed it now . 
what it is leaving behind can only be described as waste and byproducts . 
the nuclear contamination from that site is still there . 
that is a natural issue which happens . 
the mayor of Pinawa , the town in which it is located , and the Hon. Darren Praznik , MLA for that area , have clearly brought to my attention that they need assistance to bring to the attention of the government in Ottawa that this nuclear contamination and the clean up of the Whiteshell site are of utmost importance . 
we will make sure that it is raised and something is done about it . 
i will point out one last thing about it . 
when hot cells , nuclear contaminated cells , in Tunney ' s Pasture in Ottawa were decommissioned a couple of years ago , they were completely demolished and the site was returned to a green field state . 
why should Manitobans and the people of Selkirk - Interlake and Provencher expect anything less than what was done in Ontario ? 
as the chief agriculture critic I will devote the rest of my speech to agriculture issues . 
our leader has spoken quite eloquently with regard to the lack of emphasis on agriculture in the throne speech . 
for the last two years farmers across Canada have faced destructive drops in farm income . 
Saskatchewan farmers are so desperate that they are actually involved right now in a tax revolt involving the education taxes on their properties . 
we are finding that these farmers are being pushed into doing anything they can do to reduce the cost of government in particular and other costs that are helping to drive them out of business . 
i will use the gross figures for Manitoba . 
we talk about a realized net farm income drop in Manitoba to $ 64 million according to Statistics Canada figures . 
these figures are not something I made up myself . 
they are right from Statistics Canada . 
that drop to $ 64 million is $ 100 million below the $ 164 million earned by Manitoba farmers in 1998 and well below the five year average of $ 231 million . 
the program the government brought forward to address the income crisis was AIDA , the agricultural income disaster assistance program . 
the government had the understanding or misunderstanding , really , that the situation with regard to farm incomes was simply a one year drop in income in 1998 but that the drastic drop may happen in 1999 also . 
the government took the program that came to it from the safety net advisory committee , which involves a lot of farmers ' groups , et cetera . 
the government changed that recommendation around to make the program fit the budget the minister thought he could get for it , instead of making the program fit the crisis and address the problem . 
that is exactly why AIDA has not worked . 
i will just give a couple of examples of farmers who were applying for AIDA and receiving nothing . 
one story is that in May of this year two brothers who are farmers in Manitoba applied . 
their application is still sitting in the review area of AIDA . 
the way the farm is set up , they expect to get approximately $ 70,000 back from AIDA . 
they have received nothing and they are on the verge of going bankrupt . 
over past months , certainly since last fall in particular and in fact right from 1993 , the Reform Party has made many suggestions to the government on how it can increase the income of farmers . 
as a result , I would only suggest that the government review all the material we in the Reform have produced , take those suggestions and implement them immediately to help solve the crisis in western Canada and across the country . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
i would like to ask my hon. colleague to comment on a couple of points . 
first , we lost the benefit of the Crow rate under the Liberal government . 
it seems to me the Crow rate agreement was also an agreement in perpetuity , but the government just said with impunity that it would wipe it out and give them a bit of a cash payment which hopefully would cover it . 
could the member comment on to what degree the cash payment came even close to covering the long term costs of farmers transporting their grain to the ports ? 
my second question is with regard to transportation problems . 
when I was a youngster my dad used to ask " How come when I buy a combine or a tractor that is manufactured in Ontario I have to pay the freight to get it from Ontario to Saskatchewan , but when I sell them my wheat I have to pay the freight to send their wheat back to Ontario ? " 
i would like the member to comment on those two points . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
that Liberal promise along with the promise of the Conservatives over the years assured western Canadian farmers that the Crow rate , which was a subsidy for exporting grain , would be kept in perpetuity . 
western Canadian farmers certainly knew better than the Liberal and Conservative governments . 
the real devastation regarding the income problem and the cash taken out of farmers ' pockets when the subsidy was not received anymore was that starting in 1993 with the trade agreement and in 1995 with the federal budget , domestic support for agriculture was drastically reduced by the government in an attempt to balance its deficit . 
in doing so it brought in user fees and all kinds of charges , increased taxes and all of the things that have taken away the meagre incomes farmers were getting from exporting their grain . 
what do we see ? 
nothing is happening by way of money for the majority of farmers in western Canada in particular , and in Ontario , to keep them on the farm and keep the farms going . 
what will happen ? 
it will end up that this country ' s farmland will be owned by absentee landlords . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , Peace River country has had a double whammy . 
it has had a series of very wet years that have caused farmers to have a low three year margin net income . 
the government put together an AIDA program that said it would base payments on a three year margin net income . 
guess what ? 
it was so low that farmers do not have the income to get a payout . 
that is why they are failing again to pay - 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
we have to resume debate . 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to represent Vancouver Kingsway and take part in today ' s debate . 
i am splitting my time with the hon. member for St. Paul ' s . 
we are entering the century of the Pacific . 
it is very fitting , as the Prime Minister has noted , that a Canadian who came to the country as a young refugee from China should be the new Governor General . 
that an individual who arrived in Canada as a refugee can attain the position of Governor General , a post deeply rooted in our tradition , is a symbol to the world . 
it is a very special appointment and symbol that Canada affords to all citizens the opportunity to participate fully in our society . 
it is a symbol that all citizens , whether born on Canadian soil or having arrived as migrants from other nations , can and do make meaningful contributions . 
it is a symbol that Canada is a nation that recognizes talent and diversity . 
indeed over the last century our society has blossomed with migrants from the four corners of the globe arriving and contributing . 
the appointment of the Governor General is a true reflection and celebration of cultural diversity in Canada today . 
i would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on this important appointment . 
that such an appointment has been made under this government demonstrates its recognition and appreciation of the rich and beautiful cultural fibre that our nation has . 
that so many aspects of this country are flourishing is a credit to our Liberal government , but we must continue to build on our strengths . 
we must strive to increase the quality of life of all Canadians . 
children are at the forefront of our investment in the future . 
this government is committed to ensuring that children receive the support and attention they need . 
many studies demonstrate that the early years of a child ' s life are very important . 
loving and involved parents are the cornerstone of the well - being , happiness and success of every child . 
the government is to be commended on its solid commitment to extend employment insurance maternity benefits and parental leave . 
maternal leave time will be extended from a current maximum to a full year , a year that will provide invaluable time for all our children . 
the government has shown its insight in providing new benefits to accommodate the diverse needs of Canadian families . 
those benefits will be more flexible , more adaptable to the wide range of realities that face Canadian families . 
this government wants to ensure that children are equipped with all the capacities they need to be ready to learn when they begin school and to grow into healthy productive adults . 
as a government , as responsible citizens , we have no higher priority than our children . 
as our children grow they must be well educated in good schools and institutions that will provide them with skills that will prepare them for work and future challenges , that will prepare them to be successful in a global economy . 
that is why the investment this government has announced for our post - secondary institutions is so crucial . 
in the Prime Minister ' s address , he endorsed a plan to create 1,200 new chairs for research excellence in universities across Canada and more important , a plan for the financial support needed to make them internationally competitive . 
that was not an empty commitment : $ 60 million in the first year of the plan ; $ 122 million in the second year ; $ 180 million in the third year ; and following that , a further $ 120 million will fund 800 additional chairs . 
canada needs those university chair endowments to compete for , to attract and to retain researchers of international calibre . 
furthermore , those researchers will train our students to become the best and the brightest in the world . 
such investment in post - secondary institutions ensures Canadians will have the resources and expertise to be successful in a highly competitive world . 
those endowments will ensure Canada is at the forefront of the knowledge based economy . 
the Canada Foundation for Innovation has already been created . 
that $ 1 billion endowment is helping to build a leading edge national system of innovation . 
knowledge and technological innovation are the cornerstones of a higher standard of living and a better quality of life . 
in January the Canadian millennium scholarship fund will begin to generate over 10,000 scholarships . 
the government ' s SchoolNet project has connected every public school and library in Canada . 
the community access program will have public Internet sites in 10,000 rural and urban communities before the end of this year . 
the government has and will continue to increase support for lifelong learning to ensure Canada has the most highly skilled and knowledgeable workforce in the world . 
the previous commitments of the government and those outlined in the Speech from the Throne indicate the level of commitment this government has to ensure Canadians will embrace the challenges of the 21 st century . 
this investment in education and research will fuel the Canadian economy of the next century . 
our economy will continue to strive and to grow . 
Canadian families will benefit . 
continued tax reduction will foster an even more dynamic economy . 
the next budget will lay out a multi - year plan for further tax reduction . 
i am a member of the finance committee and we will be conducting prebudget public hearings to listen to Canadians for their ideas and suggestions for our next budget . 
we are one of the leading industrialized nations in the world . 
the future will see great advances in business , government and society . 
the way to the 21 st century is to invest in the cornerstones of our society . 
we will invest in our children , in our families , in our researchers and in our educational system . 
let us be clear . 
what this government will not do is sacrifice our financial health . 
Canadians from British Columbia and indeed from coast to coast to coast recognize this is the direction for Canada in the next century . 
the government is doing what Canadians want . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member . 
she said that the 21 st century would belong to the Pacific region . 
will the hon. member be able to influence her government colleagues , so that they take a stand regarding the labeling of genetically modified products ? 
may be the hon. member can influence her colleagues . 
i would like to hear her comments on this issue . 
Ms. Sophia Leung : 
madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for her very thoughtful question . 
it would be very interesting for our government to consider and I think a lot of study will follow . 
in the meantime , very strict regulations will be set up . 
i thank her for calling this matter to our attention . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened to the hon. member ' s speech with great interest . 
she outlined a whole raft of them in her speech for which they are going to need taxpayers ' money . 
certainly , something like that we can all agree with . 
however , I wonder when she and her Liberal colleagues will get it through their heads that the easiest way to improve the quality of life for Canadians is to lift the oppressive tax burden which they face . 
i do not want to hear the hon. member insult Canadians ' intelligence by talking about $ 16.5 billion in tax cuts .
