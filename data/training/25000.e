speech FROM THE THRONE 
the Speaker : 
honourable Members of the Senate , 
members of the House of Commons , 
ladies and Gentlemen : 
it is an honour for me , today , to open this Second Session of the Thirty - Sixth Parliament of Canada . 
i am very aware of the sacrifices that so many of you make in your personal and professional lives in accepting the challenges of public office . 
the commitment you have made is one that I share , and I look forward to working with you over the next five years in the service of the people of Canada . 
today , the representatives of the Canadian people gather to open the session of Parliament that will carry the country into the new millennium . 
we stand before a new century confident in the promise of Canada for our children and grandchildren . 
technology is altering every aspect of our lives . 
knowledge and creativity are now the driving force in a new economy . 
and collaboration is becoming more essential as the issues facing our diverse society grow in their complexity . 
but Canadians will succeed in this changing world , just as we have succeeded throughout our country ' s history . 
the promise of Canada was born in an age when countries were forged through war or revolution . 
our nation ' s founders chose a unique path , which has become the Canadian way - creating a country dedicated to peace , order and good government for all its citizens . 
it took foresight and commitment to break the mould of the nation - state founded on a single language , culture or religion . 
that foresight and commitment have been greatly rewarded . 
canada began as a small colony with little industry and no role of its own in global affairs . 
over generations , individual Canadians built a better future for their families and their communities . 
Canadians and their governments overcame barriers of distance and a harsh northern climate to build a national railway , a system of highways , a postal service , and national cultural institutions , as well as hospitals , universities , and other institutions . 
Canadians and their governments also put in place a modern social safety net . 
together , these achievements have provided the foundation for our quality of life . 
within a few generations , we evolved into an independent nation with an advanced industrialized economy and a voice in the councils of the world : the United Nations , the G - 8 , the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development , NATO , and many others . 
but whenever tyranny has threatened peace and security , Canadians have never hesitated to answer the call . 
together with our proud Canadian veterans , we remember those who paid with their lives at Vimy Ridge , on Juno Beach , and at Hill 355 in Korea . 
in the tradition of the coureurs des bois , we have explored the frontiers of science . 
from the invention of newsprint to the creation of advanced computer languages , Canadian ingenuity has helped to build the information age . 
from the discovery of insulin to the earliest pacemaker , Canadians have given new life to millions around the world . 
canada was a pioneer in the peaceful use of space , becoming a leader in satellite communications and remote - sensing technologies . 
today , our astronauts are using Canadian technology to help assemble the International Space Station - the largest scientific project in history . 
in a complex world , diverse approaches , skills and ideas are essential to building a higher quality of life . 
canada is a bilingual country in which both men and women of many different cultures , races and religions participate in economic , social and political life . 
our diversity is a source of strength and creativity , making us modern and forward - looking . 
our actions and our history make us at home in a world of change and increasing interdependence . 
our human talent , our values and our commitment to working together will secure Canada ' s leadership in the knowledge - based economy . 
today , Canadians can look with pride on Canada ' s success . 
we have a dynamic economy , a strong and democratic society , and a sense of community . 
we are recognized throughout the world for our quality of life . 
we will build a higher quality of life for all Canadians - for our children , ourselves , and our neighbours . 
a Strong and United Canada 
a high quality of life for Canadians and a strong , united Canada are inseparable . 
the Government will continue to take a comprehensive approach to strengthening the unity of our country . 
all its actions will serve to strengthen Canada by enhancing the quality of life of Canadians . 
our federal system allows us to value the different strengths of each region of our country . 
it guarantees all citizens equal rights and freedoms . 
and it enables Canada ' s wealth to be shared by all citizens no matter where they live - from Newfoundland in the east , to British Columbia in the west , to our newest territory , Nunavut , in the north . 
over the last two Parliaments , Canadians have built a foundation for even greater success . 
our artists , writers , musicians and filmmakers draw admiration from around the world . 
and Canada itself earns the respect of the community of nations as a symbol of peace , democracy and compassion . 
the best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians . 
but there are some who would pull us apart rather than bring us together . 
even though Quebeckers do not want a third referendum , the Government of Quebec continues to talk about holding another one . 
the Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians that the principle of clarity , as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada , will be respected . 
this requires national will , national strategies and partnerships across the country . 
citizens and governments must collaboratively build an even stronger and more united Canada , a Canada that remains an example to the world . 
Canadians expect their national government to focus on areas where it can and must make a difference . 
and they want this done in the Canadian way - working together , balancing individual and government action , and listening to citizens . 
Canadians expect their Government to be fiscally prudent , to reduce the debt burden , to cut taxes , and to pursue the policies necessary for a strong society . 
the emerging global marketplace offers an enormous opportunity to create more Canadian jobs , more Canadian growth and more Canadian influence in the world . 
achieving a higher quality of life requires a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the transition to the knowledge - based economy , promote our interests and project our values in the world . 
together , we will strive for excellence . 
this demands that we collaborate with our partners to : 
develop our children and youth , our leaders for the 21 st century ; 
build a dynamic economy ; 
strengthen health and quality care for Canadians ; 
ensure the quality of our environment ; 
build stronger communities ; 
strengthen the relationship with Canada ' s Aboriginal peoples ; and 
advance Canada ' s place in the world . 
our Children 
because of the changing nature of the world economy , the prospects for a high quality of life in any country will depend - as never before - on having a population that is adaptable , resilient and ready to learn throughout life . 
the foundation for this is laid in the very early years . 
no commitment we make today will be more important for the long - term prosperity and well - being of our society than the commitment to invest our efforts in very young children . 
parents and families have the primary responsibility for the care of their children . 
but all of society must work together to ensure that our children develop the abilities to succeed . 
the Government will extend and make more accessible Employment Insurance benefits for parental leave , to help parents take more time from work to spend with their children . 
it will make its own workplace policies and those of federally regulated employers more family friendly . 
through further tax relief , it will put more dollars in the hands of families with children . 
and , with its provincial and territorial partners , it will work to reform family law and strengthen supports provided to families to ensure that , in cases of separation or divorce , the needs and best interests of children come first . 
federal , provincial and territorial governments are developing together the National Children ' s Agenda . 
as part of this work , it is the Government ' s objective to reach an agreement among governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further support parents and families . 
this plan will be consistent with the Social Union Framework Agreement . 
it will set out common principles , objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments to increase resources and further strengthen supports for early childhood development . 
to make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty , the federal , provincial and territorial governments also established the National Child Benefit . 
the Government of Canada is already investing an additional $ 1.7 billion annually in low - income families with children , while the provinces and territories are investing in complementary services . 
the Government wants no family to have to choose between a job and benefits for their children . 
therefore , by 2002 , the Government will make a third significant investment in the National Child Benefit , while seeking a commitment from its provincial and territorial partners to increase their investment in services for families with children . 
young Canadians 
young Canadians are the leaders of tomorrow . 
already , they are at home in the wired world . 
they have energy , ideas and technological savvy , and they want to contribute to building their country in the 21 st century . 
in our global and connected world , young Canadians are acquiring knowledge and skills at an earlier age . 
the Government will focus on providing young people with more opportunities to connect to the Canadian experience , to view their country in all its splendour , to gain a first - hand understanding of the different regions , and to be challenged by what they learn from their fellow citizens across this land . 
the Government will : 
draw on the expertise of young Canadians to help connect rural and urban communities to the information highway , by hiring them to put in place additional Internet access sites for public use ; 
create a single - window service - Exchanges Canada - to give 100,000 young Canadians every year the chance to learn about another part of the country ; 
ensure that younger Canadians - from age 13 - are given an opportunity to apply their creative abilities , by providing them with a chance to produce their " first works " using traditional approaches and new technologies in the arts , cultural , digital and other industries ; 
actively engage tens of thousands of young Canadian volunteers to participate in community and national environmental projects and to help others improve their literacy skills ; and 
enable young Canadians to apply their energy and talents overseas , by participating in international internship programs and helping developing countries get connected to the Internet . 
in addition , the Government will continue to place a priority on providing young Canadians with career information , access to work experience , and learning opportunities . 
a Dynamic Economy for the 21 st Century 
in the global , knowledge - based economy , the advantage goes to countries that are innovative , have high levels of productivity , quickly adopt the latest technology , invest in skills development for their citizens , and seek out new opportunities around the world . 
Canadians have built a strong and dynamic economy . 
it is the cornerstone of our quality of life - providing Canada with the means to continue building a more equitable society , a healthier population , and stronger communities . 
in the space of only a few years , our nation ' s finances have gone from deficits and debt to balanced budgets , with low inflation and low interest rates . 
laws and regulations have been modernized and the role of government in business decisions has been reduced . 
the Government will continue to build a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden , cutting taxes , and making strategic investments . 
such investments will help small businesses grow , encourage trade , support citizens in developing the skills they need , and ensure that Canada has modern infrastructure . 
the Government is committed to prudent fiscal management . 
it will never let the nation ' s finances get out of control again . 
it will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track . 
it will deliver on the commitment it made at the beginning of this Parliament to devote half the budget surplus to debt repayment and tax relief , and the other half to investments that address the social and economic needs of Canadians . 
tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the growth and wealth which enable those public and private investments necessary for a high quality of life . 
in its next budget , the Government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reduction . 
increased Trade and Investment 
canada ' s economy is more open than any of the leading industrialized countries . 
we are blessed with a population that comes from countries all over the world . 
foreign markets for our goods and services provide us with new opportunities . 
foreign investment provides us with capital , new ideas , new technologies , and innovative business practices . 
to build on Canada ' s advantage , the Government will increase its trade promotion in strategic sectors with high export potential - sectors ranging from biotechnology and environmental and information technology to tourism , culture and health . 
it will also continue to support innovation and the development of new technologies in leading export sectors such as agriculture , agri - food and natural resources . 
it will launch Investment Team Canada - a co - ordinated effort by all governments and the private sector to make the international community more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth in Canada . 
the Government will also modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada . 
in addition , the Government will work with its partners in the hemisphere toward the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005 . 
skills and Knowledge for the 21 st Century 
a skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are crucial building blocks of a successful 21 st century economy . 
over the last three years , the Government has put in place a strategy to build on Canada ' s advantage as the country with the most highly educated workforce in the world . 
it has made it easier to save for a child ' s education . 
it will make college and university more affordable through Canada Millennium Scholarships . 
it has improved student debt relief and provided better tax assistance to finance lifelong learning . 
we will continue to build on this strategy . 
the Government will forge partnerships with other governments , public - and private - sector organizations , and Canadian men and women to establish a national action plan on skills and learning for the 21 st century . 
this plan will focus on lifelong learning , address the challenge of poor literacy among adults , and provide citizens with the information they need to make good decisions about developing their skills . 
over the next two years , the Government will work with its partners to : 
make it easier for Canadians to finance lifelong learning ; and 
provide a single window to Canada - wide information about labour markets , skills requirements and training opportunities - on the Internet , over the telephone or in person in communities across the country . 
to ensure that the Public Service of Canada remains a strong , representative , professional and non - partisan national institution that provides Canadians the highest quality service into the 21 st century , the Government will also focus on the recruitment , retention and continuous learning of a skilled federal workforce . 
infrastructure for the 21 st Century 
achieving this objective will require new types of infrastructure . 
knowledge Infrastructure 
improving Canada ' s knowledge infrastructure means supporting a new generation of leaders , attracting the best researchers , and encouraging our graduates to put their talents to work here at home . 
the Government will introduce the legislation necessary to create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research . 
these institutes will provide a model for world - leading research , bringing together for the first time all the researchers who have an impact on health to undertake shared research priorities . 
this innovative approach recognizes the importance of collaborative research for improving the health and well - being of Canadians and for building a high - quality health system . 
the Government of Canada has for many years been one of the most important contributors to research at Canadian universities . 
in the last two years , the Government has pursued an ambitious agenda to improve its support for advanced research in Canada . 
to build on this agenda , the Government will : 
increase its support to the Granting Councils , enabling them to forge new partnerships with our universities to attract the best research minds in the world through an innovative program of 21 st Century Chairs for Research Excellence ; 
foster greater international research collaboration by Canadian universities and institutes and expand Canadian expertise in such areas as genomics , climate change , and advanced engineering ; and 
find new markets for new products and services developed through research by universities and government research centres . 
the Government will also ensure that it has a modern and effective research and science capacity to promote the health , safety and economic well - being of Canadians . 
information Infrastructure 
improving Canada ' s information infrastructure will support the exchange of ideas and the conduct of business over computer networks , connect Canadians to the information highway , and accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce . 
the Government will : 
take steps to make Canada a centre of excellence for electronic commerce and encourage its use throughout the economy ; 
re - introduce legislation to protect personal and business information in the digital world and to recognize electronic signatures ; and 
the Government will become a model user of information technology and the Internet . 
we will build on a pilot project now under way to make www . access . ca 
our knowledge - based economy is more than high - tech companies . 
it is an economy in which all sectors strive to use leading technologies and processes . 
it is an economy in which clusters of technology development already exist in smaller communities all over Canada . 
indeed , it is an economy in which technology can lead to greater economic stability for the primarily rural regions in which cyclical resource industries - agriculture , fisheries , forestry , mining and tourism - are the dominant sources of wealth . 
the Government will encourage the development and adoption of new technologies in all sectors . 
cultural Infrastructure 
the strength of Canada is reflected in its rich diversity . 
across this country , Canada ' s culture comes alive through our writers , singers and performers , through our filmmakers and artists , and through those who chronicle our history and preserve our heritage . 
it will put collections from the National Archives , National Library and other key institutions on - line . 
physical Infrastructure 
canada must also continue to improve its physical infrastructure for the 21 st century . 
to increase trade and economic growth , we must ensure that we have the capacity to move people and goods safely and efficiently . 
to maintain the quality of life in our cities and rural communities , we must ensure that we have clean air and water . 
the Government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach - by the end of the year 2000 - agreement on a five - year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country . 
health and Quality Care for Canadians 
good health and quality care are essential to the well - being of all Canadians and are part of our strength in today ' s global marketplace . 
advances in technology , research and information are opening tremendous new opportunities for improving the health and well - being of citizens . 
Canadians expect their governments to work together to ensure that Canada ' s health care system is modern and sustainable . 
the Government recently reaffirmed its commitment to medicare by investing an additional $ 11.5 billion to modernize the health system for the beginning of the 21 st century . 
the Government will continue to move forward with its provincial and territorial partners and the health care community on common priorities . 
with its partners , the Government will support the testing of innovations in integrated service delivery in areas such as home care and pharmacare , working toward a health system in which all parts operate seamlessly . 
a modern health information system will give health professionals and individual citizens improved access to up - to - date information about health issues and treatment options . 
the Government will ensure that citizens in every region of the country have access to such information so they can make better - informed decisions . 
the Government will protect the health of Canadians by strengthening Canada ' s food safety program , by taking further action on environmental health issues , including the potential health risks presented by pesticides , and by modernizing overall health protection for a changing world . 
we will also continue to address the serious health problems in Aboriginal communities , supporting their efforts to promote wellness and to strengthen the delivery of health services . 
the Quality of Our Environment 
the long - term economic and social well - being of every Canadian depends on the state of our natural environment . 
canada ' s ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be part of Canada ' s strength in the 21 st century . 
Canadians have long recognized the underlying relationship between a healthy environment and a high quality of life . 
Canadians and leading businesses are already working in their own communities to preserve the natural environment , pushing the frontiers and opportunities of environmental technologies and new eco - efficient practices . 
the quality of the environment in our communities is also linked to the environmental health of other communities around the world . 
problems such as climate change and dangerous levels of persistent toxins can be resolved only through concerted international action . 
within Canada , the Government will work with other governments and citizens to meet our country ' s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
it will set and enforce tough pollution standards , in particular to better protect the health of children , seniors and residents of the North . 
it will place greater emphasis on sustainable development in government decision making . 
it will also address the structural weaknesses that have been identified in the management of toxic substances . 
internationally , Canada will provide technical assistance to developing countries in adopting sustainable practices . 
the Government will introduce legislation and stewardship programs , working with provinces and territories to ensure that species at risk and their critical natural habitat are protected . 
the Government will also continue to extend Canada ' s national parks system . 
in its own operations , the Government will make itself a model of environmental excellence . 
it will do more to clean up contaminated federal sites . 
it will strengthen its capacity for conducting environmental science research . 
it will also explore new environmental clean - up technologies . 
the Government will report regularly on the results achieved in addressing the top environmental concerns of Canadians . 
building Stronger Communities 
working Together 
our history has been one of Canadians helping Canadians to seize opportunities and rise to challenges . 
this commitment to working together - by Canadians , their governments and their communities - will ensure Canada ' s continued success in addressing the complex issues of the 21 st century . 
it also commits governments to eliminating barriers that unjustifiably impede the mobility of citizens within Canada . 
these barriers include rules that prevent some citizens from obtaining recognition of their qualifications when they move to another province , that deny some students use of their student loans when they study out - of - province , and that restrict access to essential services for some citizens - including those with disabilities - because of their province of origin . 
the Government of Canada is committed to working together with its partners to meet the deadlines set out in the Social Union Framework Agreement , thereby removing all unjustifiable barriers to mobility no later than 2002 . 
in 2001 , Canadians will mark the International Year of Volunteers - a time to celebrate the achievements of Canada ' s everyday heroes . 
the Government recognizes the need to build partnerships with communities and to renew its relationship with the voluntary organizations that serve and sustain them . 
the Government will enter into a national accord with the voluntary sector , laying a new foundation for active partnership with voluntary organizations in the service of Canadians . 
strong communities depend on the participation of all their members . 
to this end , the Government will pursue its efforts with other governments , the private and voluntary sectors , and all citizens to build communities in which Canadians with disabilities are fully included and in which new Canadians feel more at home . 
in addition , the Government will continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the root causes of homelessness and help communities respond to their members ' needs for shelter and other support . 
promoting Safer Communities 
Canadians are justifiably proud of having built communities where citizens feel safe . 
this is a key component of our quality of life and a contributor to Canada ' s comparative advantage . 
the Government will work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe . 
its focus will be balanced , combining prevention and a community - centred approach with action to deal with serious crime . 
it will expand the community - based crime prevention strategy and re - introduce legislation to reform the youth justice system . 
the Government will combat drug trafficking while helping communities aid those most affected . 
it will also launch a program of restorative justice to help victims overcome the trauma of crime and provide non - violent offenders with a chance to help repair the damage caused by their actions . 
the Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats to Canadians and their neighbours around the world . 
it will work to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global in scope , including money laundering , terrorism , and the smuggling of people , drugs and guns . 
the Government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP and other agencies to address threats to public security in Canada and work with enforcement agencies in other countries . 
in addition , it will work to modernize legislation to better ensure public security . 
the Government of Canada will also continue to work closely with the Government of the United States to modernize our shared border for the 21 st century . 
a Stronger Relationship with Canada ' s Aboriginal Peoples 
the contribution of Canada ' s Aboriginal peoples has shaped our country ' s heritage and will continue to enrich Canada in the new century . 
the Government will continue to build on the strong foundation of reconciliation and renewal created by Gathering Strength - Canada ' s Aboriginal Action Plan . 
we are now building stronger partnerships with Aboriginal people - concentrating on improving their living conditions and , increasingly , on strengthening their economies . 
as a result , Aboriginal people will be able to more fully participate in and contribute to Canada ' s economic development and social well - being . 
fostering good government and strong accountability in First Nations communities will increase investor confidence , support economic partnerships , and improve living conditions . 
land claim agreements , in particular , are essential to create certainty for Aboriginal people and their surrounding communities - providing the climate needed for partnerships , investments and economic opportunities . 
early in the new session of Parliament , the Government will introduce legislation to implement the historic agreement with the Nisga ' a . 
canada ' s Place in the World 
as we move into the 21 st century , Canada has the momentum to lead the way toward a safer and more secure world . 
Canadians have built the highest quality of life in the world by focussing on the needs of people . 
we have the expertise to advance an agenda of human security - protecting people from threats to their rights , their safety and their lives . 
we have a reputation internationally for making a difference - through our contribution to eliminating landmines , our work with NATO and the United Nations in Kosovo , our development assistance to Asia and Africa , our efforts to establish the International Criminal Court , and our work to renew the international financial system . 
Canadians recognize that their quality of life depends in part on the quality of life of their neighbours - those who share this planet with us . 
a world where people are secure is a world where fewer people are forced to flee their homes , where there is less crime and terrorism , and where there is a reduced threat of disease and pollution . 
the Government will give increased prominence to human security in its foreign policy , working to achieve meaningful progress in the councils of the world on a global human security agenda . 
in 2001 , the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on children . 
in the spirit of partnership that led to the historic treaty banning landmines , the Government will work to reach key international agreements to protect the rights of children . 
canada will champion efforts to eliminate the exploitation of children , including the use of child soldiers in armed conflict , and will help address the crisis of children affected by the HIV / AIDS epidemic . 
the Government will act with like - minded countries to reform and strengthen international institutions such as the United Nations , International Monetary Fund , World Bank and World Trade Organization . 
it will also work to develop a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world . 
to advance Canada ' s leadership in the Arctic region , the Government will outline a foreign policy for the North that enhances co - operation , helps protect the environment , promotes trade and investment , and supports the security of the region ' s people . 
the Government will increase international development assistance and work in innovative ways to enable poor countries to improve the quality of life of their citizens . 
the Government will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Forces have the capacity to support Canada ' s role in building a more secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and security in foreign lands . 
honouring Canada ' s Promise for the 21 st Century 
as we prepare to celebrate the turn of the millennium , we can look to our past with pride and to our future with confidence . 
like previous generations , we will face new challenges . 
but guided by our values and our collective experience , we can ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world in which to live - the best place to raise children , to learn , to pursue opportunity , to share in rich , diverse and safe communities , and to admire the beauty of nature . 
all Canadians - every citizen , every government , every business and every community organization - have a part to play . 
we will build the 21 st century together .

( motion agreed to ) 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
address IN REPLY 
the House proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered by Her Excellency the Governor General at the opening of the session . 
Mr. Rick Limoges ( Windsor - St. 
Mr. Speaker , it is with a profound sense honour and humility that I move the motion , seconded by the hon. member for Laval West , on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
i would like to pay my respects to Her Excellency the Governor General and thank her for delivering the speech to both Houses . 
i offer the governor general my sincere congratulations on her historic appointment and wish her much success in the years ahead . 
i would also like to thank the Right Hon. Prime Minister and the government for the honour conferred on me , the recently elected member of parliament for the riding of Windsor - St. 
as hon. members know , earlier this year I succeeded my friend and hon. members ' former colleague , the late Shaughnessy Cohen . 
Shaughnessy had a heart of gold and an infectious personality . 
she served her constituents well and I intend to be just as enthusiastic as she was in representing the interests of my constituents . 
the riding of Windsor - St. 
they are hard working people who play by the rules , raise their families and care deeply about their community and their country . 
proof of this can be seen in the fact that for the last 30 years the Windsor - Essex county area has led the country in per capita donations to the United Way . 
the tremendous sense of pride and community I see every day in Windsor and Tecumseh is what makes serving as their member of parliament so meaningful to me . 
along with numerous other localities in Canada , Windsor - St. 
Clair has an active and vibrant francophone community to which I am proud to belong . 
my parents , and their parents before them , were aware of the importance of preserving their language and culture and equally aware of the challenge involved . 
i face that same challenge every day , as do my children . 
our government has done much to enshrine the rights of francophone Canadians from sea to sea . 
Windsor is proud of its heritage as Canada ' s car capital . 
Windsor is equally proud to be the home of Hiram Walker , producers of the famous Canadian Club whisky . 
Windsor ' s long - established industries are doing very well under our government , but the city has progressed beyond its traditional industrial base of assembly and manufacturing plants . 
the Windsor casino , with its 20,000 - plus visitors daily , has become Canada ' s number one tourist attraction . 
among its positive economic effects are the thousands of well paid jobs it has created , and the millions of dollars in new revenue to the provincial government , in large part from U.S. visitors . 
Windsor ' s economy is changing in other ways as well . 
for example , aided by our government ' s investment in technological and skills development Windsor is now the tool and mould capital of the world . 
our city is home to well over 100 high tech design firms using state of the art computers , machines and robotics . 
industrial leaders in our community such as Tony Toldo , the Rodzik family , Michael Soltz and Steve Reko are demonstrating Canada ' s leadership in quality manufacturing , industrial design and research . 
during our government ' s time in office there has been considerable corporate investment in Windsor . 
the big three automakers , General Motors , Ford and Daimler - Chrysler , have all made significant investments to the lasting benefit of Windsor and Canada . 
the centre is using state of the art computer assisted design and telecommunications technology . 
such investments are a clear demonstration of confidence in Canada ' s economy and an acknowledgement that Canadian workers are highly skilled , well educated and efficient . 
it also reflects a great degree of confidence in our government and our Prime Minister . 
of course , coming from Windsor I have very large shoes to fill . 
Paul Martin Sr . , Eugene Whelan and Mark MacGuigan served in government with great distinction as very effective representatives of their fellow citizens . 
my colleague , the member of parliament for Windsor West , the Deputy Prime Minister , has not only served our part of the country throughout his long and distinguished career , he has worked on behalf of all Canadians . 
they instilled in their children the importance of making a meaningful contribution to our community and the world around us . 
that is why I spent 14 years on city council in Windsor prior to joining members here . 
when I decided to run for parliament it was because I wanted to help Canadians realize their dreams . 
i wanted to help build on the accomplishments of this government . 
in my previous career in the banking industry I had many opportunities to help people realize their dreams . 
i worked with men and women who were applying for student loans , loans for their first cars , mortgages for their first homes or starting new businesses . 
i helped people invest their life savings and plan for their retirement years . 
i listened to their dreams and their plans for the future . 
i also remember when Canadians were uncertain about the future , insecure about their jobs or unable to find one . 
i remember when there was a huge budget deficit , high interest rates and a ballooning national debt . 
most of us seriously doubted that the nation ' s pension plan would be there for us when our turn came to retire . 
there was little talk about dreams and the future and more about just making it to the end of the week . 
that was six years ago . 
the leadership and balanced approach of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have meant that this government has been able to accomplish many things . 
over the years the government has introduced major tax cuts , eliminated the deficit and begun to reduce the national debt . 
our government is investing in priorities such as health care , education and technological innovation to prepare Canada for the 21 st century . 
today the unemployment rate in Windsor is a mere half of what it was in 1993 and the local economy is very strong . 
now when I run into my former clients they are again talking about their dreams . 
they have renewed hope for the future . 
canada is now experiencing the longest stretch of economic growth since the 1960 s . 
in the last budget , we announced $ 7.7 billion in tax cuts over a three year period , and the tax cuts of $ 16.5 billion announced in our last two budgets will benefit all taxpayers . 
in fact , 600,000 low income Canadians will pay absolutely no federal income tax . 
we have brought down a second balanced , surplus budget . 
we have proposed a tax plan of four consecutive balanced , surplus budgets . 
this is only the third time since Confederation that such a feat has been accomplished . 
as part of the Canadian equal opportunity strategy , we announced an additional investment of over $ 500 million for the purpose of creating Canadian institutes for health research . 
this is a record of commitment , a record of achievement , a record in which our government can take pride . 
it is a testament to the vision and the leadership of our Prime Minister . 
more important , this is a record that has improved the life of every Canadian . 
there is still much more that remains to be done . 
we must continue to reduce the tax burden on Canadians in a meaningful and responsible manner . 
we must continue to reduce the national debt and we must continue to foster a climate where entrepreneurs can succeed , where we reward talent and hard work , and where Canadians can be confident in their economic future . 
at the same time we must build on the strengths of our national health care system and take steps to modernize it so that it is ready for the challenges of the 21 st century . 
we must provide families with the support framework they need to ensure that Canada ' s children , our children , get the best possible start in life . 
working with provinces and territories , we have opened a new front in the war on child poverty with the creation of the national child benefit system , the most important new social program since medicare . 
it takes an innovative national approach to helping low income families with children . 
the Government of Canada ' s contribution to the national child benefit system is the Canada child tax benefit , CCTB . 
we have pledged to increase the CCTB by $ 2 billion by Canada Day 2000 . 
this means a family earning $ 20,000 with two children will get over $ 3,700 through the CCTB . 
we must invest in higher learning and scientific research to secure our place in a knowledge based economy . 
this year Canada became the first country in the world to connect every public school and every public library to the Internet . 
these are an enormous hit with parents saving for their children ' s future education . 
over 300,000 new RESP accounts have been opened since the new grant was announced last year . 
since we must act in all these areas , I am pleased to see that the Speech from the Throne proposes a proactive agenda . 
the last throne speech of the 20 th century is truly an action plan that sets the foundations for a promising future . 
as a federal member of parliament , one of my priorities is to try to improve our national roadway system , because it is critical to the quality of life of all Canadians . 
our roads are used to transport the products we sell and the food we eat to Canadian cities and towns . 
the roadway system is the backbone of our tourist industry and the lifeline of our foreign trade . 
Clair we are the victims of cross border pollution in addition to what we ourselves add to the mix . 
in recent years Canadians have become increasingly aware of all types of pollution . 
while many industries are working to clean up their act , like the Ford Motor Company attaining ISO 14001 certification in our local plants , citizens are worried that individuals in the various levels of government are neglecting their environmental responsibilities . 
getting to know our new Minister of the Environment has given me a renewed sense of confidence in our ability to make real progress . 
that message is also reinforced in a vision expressed in the Speech from the Throne . 
one of the best ways to succeed is to support the development of clean technologies . 
for example , this spring Daimler - Chrysler revealed the first zero emission fuel cell car in North America . 
the Ballard fuel cell is Canadian technology that is also being successfully tested in mass transit . 
such a development could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
in closing I leave the House with this thought . 
in the last election Canadians chose our government to lead the nation into the 21 st century . 
canada has been recognized for six straight years by the UN as the best country in the world in which to live . 
with our government ' s inspiring vision for the future unveiled earlier today we have indicated that we are ready for the new millennium . 
together we can build a society that strikes the right balance between economic investment and respect for the environment , the right balance between support for innovation and support for our cultural diversity . 
with a balanced approach we can build a society where every Canadian has a place and where we all share the rewards . 
together we can ensure that Canada remains the best country in the world in which to invest , to learn , to work and to live in the 21 st century . 
in doing so we will strengthen Canadians ' sense of pride and belonging to this vast , diverse and beautiful nation , a nation woven from caring communities like my own . 
i hereby move , seconded by the hon. member for Laval West , that the following address be presented to Her Excellency the Governor General of Canada : 
to Her Excellency the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson , a member of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada , Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada , Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit , Governor General and Commander - in - Chief of Canada . 
may it please Your Excellency : 
we , Her Majesty ' s most loyal and dutiful subjects , the House of Commons of Canada , in parliament assembled , beg leave to offer our humble thanks for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both houses of parliament . 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a great honour for me to second the motion for the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
as their elected representative I will continue to work with my colleagues as well as with the private sector and NGOs to meet the challenges of the new millenium , which were outlined in the Speech from the Throne . 
the riding of Laval West Quebec , is very representative of the population of both Quebec and Canada . 
it is home to Canadians of various origins , mostly francophone , but there are also many anglophones and Canadians of Greek , Portuguese , Armenian , Lebanese , Egyptian , West Indian , Jewish and other origins . 
the riding has a major rural component , depending mainly on horticulture , and a very urban component , namely the great city of Laval . 
there are low , middle and high income families . 
it is a community that works hard together and , like Canada as a whole , finds a way to affirm its diversity in unity . 
Laval is the second largest city in Quebec . 
since its inception its activities have shifted toward the secondary sector , without eliminating all of its primary sector . 
in the past 15 years Laval ' s focus has been on high tech and the industrial , commercial and financial sectors . 
the priorities set by our government in the throne speech are completely in line with the expectations and priorities of the families in Laval : a prosperous and healthy society . 
children are the foundation of the society of tomorrow . 
the more attention we focus on the children of today in their early years , the better their future and our future will be . 
dozens of community and not for profit organizations are already involved every day in helping low and middle income families . 
our government intends to adopt a positive and responsible attitude to bring hope to the families of Laval , the families of Canada . 
while I was listening to Her Excellency reading the Speech from the Throne , something kept crossing my mind . 
i believe that every member of this House , above and beyond any differences of opinion , was thinking exactly the same thing : the progress this country has made in the past six years , the work that has been accomplished by all Canadians , is truly remarkable . 
in a nutshell , Canada was on the verge of bankruptcy , and something drastic definitely needed to be done . 
this government was therefore elected with the mandate of remedying the situation . 
Canadians realized this was going to mean some difficult years and numerous sacrifices , but they also realized they could count on us to listen to them , to work along with them , to make the necessary choices , keeping in mind their values and their priorities . 
we had the confidence of Canadians and we knew that we could have confidence in them as well . 
let us look at what we have become today : a country of over 30 million people , with unemployment at its lowest level in ten years . 
the era of budget deficits is behind us . 
with inflation and interest rates under control , many Canadians are now able to buy a house and start a family without having to worry about going deep into debt . 
Canadians are also seeing their tax bill drop . 
the news in the throne speech is that their net income will rise in the years ahead . 
aware that running a country is more than an exercise in accounting , our government has done all this . 
balancing a budget is not an end in itself and neither is lowering taxes . 
rather , these are ways of bringing about a vision , our vision , the vision of all Canadians for a strong , united , and prosperous Canada with a quality of life unequalled anywhere else in the world , a Canada whose successes know no limitations . 
while some would have us live in the past , this government has always had its eye on the future , on the future of this country and on the future of every single Canadian , and the future begins with families and children . 
it begins by giving every young Canadian a chance to succeed in the new knowledge based economy and build a better quality of life . 
this government has no higher priority . 
that is why over the last few years we placed the cornerstones of the national children ' s agenda with a special focus on the problems of low income families with children . 
along with our partners we have made considerable progress so far . 
we created the national child benefit through which low income families receive in total $ 1.7 billion every year while provinces and territories are reinvesting in complementary services . 
our government has already pledged new funds that will bring the total to $ 2 billion a year by July 2000 . 
and that is not all . 
as we speak , hundreds of projects to help children and parents are under way in communities across Canada with the assistance of federal programs , projects that benefit from programs such as aboriginal head starts which were recently expanded to include children who live on reserves , the Canadian prenatal nutrition program which funds community groups that counsel and help women at risk of having unhealthy babies , the community action program for children which funds community groups that assist in meeting the developmental needs of at risk children from birth to age six . 
we did all this as we were fighting to bring the nation ' s finances under control . 
imagine what we will be able to do now . 
our government has committed to increasing resources for early childhood development , providing targeted assistance for low income families with children and fostering family friendly workplaces . 
we will continue to work with our partners , the provinces and the territories , to further improve community support for early childhood development . 
we will continue to invest in the national child benefit . 
we will continue to put more money in the hands of families through further tax relief . 
we will give parents the freedom to spend more time with their children . 
we will implement workplace policies that are more favourable to families and we will modernize family law with an eye to placing the needs of children first . 
this is not all that our government has done to help children . 
in recent years we have also introduced the Canadian opportunities strategy to provide Canadians with easier and more affordable access to education and training . 
we have established the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation and set up a $ 2.5 billion fund that will begin distributing over 100,000 scholarships a year to postsecondary students from low and middle income families starting in January . 
we have created the Canada education savings grant to help Canadians invest in their children ' s future . 
we have introduced a tax credit for interest payments on student loans . 
in addition , we have implemented other programs , the benefits of which will continue to be felt for years to come : the youth employment strategy , SchoolNet , a program promoting community access to the Internet , and the computers for schools program . 
the Speech from the Throne clearly indicated that we will be building on these sound foundations in the years to come , that we will be relying on the modern infrastructure currently being put in place , not only to improve the skills and prospects of young Canadians , but also to help them to better know their fellow Canadians from other regions and our society , which is one of diversity within unity . 
we took office at a time when major changes were taking place . 
these changes , which include globalization , the rapid emergence of new technologies and their application in all areas of the economy , have a growing impact on the daily lives of Canadians . 
Canadians had every reason to be concerned . 
not only was our country at the mercy of events , but the government had very limited means to start the process of catching up . 
the burdens of the past were preventing us from moving toward the future . 
today ' s throne speech is indicative of a complete turnaround . 
we never let go of our values . 
we never listened to those who wanted us to take the easy way out . 
we took advantage of the solidarity and determination of Canadians and we marched together toward our common objective , which is to make Canada a country with a future , a country constantly striving for ever greater success . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the official opposition I would like to extend our congratulations to Her Excellency the Governor General on both her appointment and on the presentation of her first speech from the throne . 
second , I would like to congratulate the deputy chairman and the assistant deputy chairman of committees of the whole House on their appointments . 
third , I would like to extend congratulations to the member for Windsor - St. 
Clair and the member for Laval West on their speeches in support of the government ' s legislative program . 
there are of course two sides to every story and we are looking forward to presenting the other side tomorrow . 
therefore , I move : 
that the debate be now adjourned . 
the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
that the House do now adjourn . 
the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
the Speaker : 
this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
( the House adjourned at 4.45 p.m. ) 
her Excellency 
the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson 
governor General of Canada 
installation Speech 
the Senate 
Thursday , October 7 , 1999 
prime Minister , 
you have expressed to me the affection , loyalty and esteem of the Canadian people , which it will be my honour to convey to our gracious sovereign , Queen Elizabeth II. 
i am pleased to accept the responsibility of being Her Majesty ' s representative in Canada , with all that entails , through our history and our custom . 
knowing better than anyone my own shortcomings , I undertake this task with humility and ask you all , as Canadians , to help me . 
i take on the responsibility of becoming Canada ' s 26 th Governor General since Confederation , fully conscious of the deep roots of this office , stretching back , to the Governors of New France and to the first of them , Samuel de Champlain . 
in our beloved Georgian Bay , which lies on the great water route he took from the French River to Huronia , there is a cairn , placed on a small island , between a tennis court and Champlain ' s Gas Bar & Marina , which commemorates his passage and quotes from his journal : 
Samuel de Champlain 
by canoe 
" as for me , I labour always to prepare a way for those willing to follow '' . 
those willing to follow have embodied the institution of the Governor General in ways which have demonstrated the evolution and constant reaffirmation of this country . 
canada ' s institutions have never been static . 
they are organic - evolving and growing in ways that surprise and even startle us . 
the Governor General is one skein in the woven fabric of what Eugene Forsey characterised as our " independent sovereign democracy '' . 
Champlain ' s successors have had many activists among them . 
lord Elgin , who helped Baldwin and LaFontaine to anchor the Canadian model of democracy in 1848 , stands out as somebody who appreciated the originality of a country which would promote such a project . 
he loved to wander about our few small cities , on foot , glorying in snowstorms , eschewing the formality of his office and speaking of his admiration for " this glorious country " and " its perfectly independent inhabitants '' . 
he also said , that in order to have insight into the future of all nations , it was necessary to come here . 
Vincent Massey , our first Canadian Governor General , laid the groundwork for practically all of our modern cultural institutions - the Canada Council , the National Arts Centre , the Order of Canada , among others . 
and my predecessor , Rom é o LeBlanc , reinforced the central fact of French Canada across this country , culminating in the success of last month ' s Summit that put New Brunswick and Acadia at the centre of the map of francophone reality . 
this was only fifty years after the great painter , Paul - Emile Borduas , had exhorted Quebec , and by implication , all of us , to abandon " the smooth and slippery walls of fear " by refusing " to act knowingly ( or consciously ) - beneath ( our ) psychic and physical possibilities . " 
allow me a moment of personal reflection . 
the Poy family , arriving here as refugees , in 1942 , was made up of my parents , my brother and myself . 
three of us are in this Chamber today . 
we did not arrive as part of a regular immigration procedure . 
there was no such thing for a Chinese family at that time in Canadian history . 
my mother ' s intense and abiding love is here in spirit today . 
my brother , Dr. Neville Poy , was seven when we arrived . 
and my father , Bill Poy , is here - extraordinary , in his 92 nd year . 
Lance - Corporal Poy , dispatch rider with the Hong Kong Volunteer Corps , received the Military Medal for his bravery during the battle of Hong Kong . 
like many soldiers , he never speaks of those actions , but it is his bravery , which is the underpinning of his children ' s lives . 
to have been brought up by courageous and loving parents , was a gift that made up for all we had lost . 
but it was also the place where our family was befriended by the Molots , who owned the local drugstore , the Marcottes and the Proulx , among whom we lived in Lower Town , and our guardian angels , the Potters . 
because my father had a job with the Department of Trade and Commerce and because we lived among French Canadians , I became fixated , from the age of five , with the idea of learning French . 
i remember the day when I was dressed up in my patent leather shoes and pink smocked dress , and was taken up the street by my parents to the convent of Ste. Jeanne d ' Arc , where I was interviewed by a kindly woman wearing white all around her face , while a dim crucifix glowed in the background . 
walking home , I sensed that there was dejection in the air and disappointment . 
it had been explained to my parents that it was not possible for a Protestant to receive French language education in Ottawa . 
in my lifetime , this has changed to such a radical degree that I don ' t even need to comment on it . 
but that early sense of something being impossible , which actually was nonsensical , put steel into me . 
Farley Mowat has pointed out that a little adversity in childhood is a very good thing for animals - including human ones . 
our family , like many others , had lost a great deal but we had also gained an enormous amount : a country with lakes , with small mouth bass and with free public education . 
it is a strength and not a weakness that we are a " permanently incomplete experiment built on a triangular foundation - aboriginal , francophone and anglophone '' . 
it is an old experiment , complex and , in worldly terms , largely successful . 
stumbling through darkness and racing through light , we have persisted in the creation of a Canadian civilization . 
we are constructing something different here . 
as Jean - Guy Pilon describes in one of his poems : 
À cracher au visage des é toiles . 
we have the opportunity to leave behind the useless blood calls of generations , now that we are in the new land that stretches to infinity . 
there seem to be two kinds of societies in the world today . 
perhaps there have always been only two kinds - punishing societies and forgiving societies . 
a society like Canada ' s , with its four centuries of give - and - take , compromise and acceptance , wrong - doing and redress , is basically a forgiving society . 
we try - we must try - to forgive what is past . 
the punishing society never forgets the wrongs of the past . 
the forgiving society works towards the actions of the future . 
the forgiving society enables people to behave well toward one another , to begin again , to build a society in hope and with love . 
we know , that in joining Canadian society , we will be able to accept the invitation , offered , in 1970 , by Grand Chief John Kelly : " As the years go by , the circle of the Ojibway gets bigger and bigger . 
Canadians of all colours and religions are entering that circle . 
you might feel that you have roots somewhere else , but in reality , you are right here with us . " 
that the aboriginal circle enlarges to include all of us - native and immigrant - arriving by boat and plane to a vast and beautiful land , has been characterised by Michael Ondaatje , as a " vision of nature beyond the human ego '' . 
this is a place , he said , " fixated by the preoccupying image of figures permanently travelling or portaging their past - we are all still arriving . 
from the Filles du Roy to Dionne Brand ' s new Canadians is a miniscule step '' . 
we must not forget that this complexity is whole . 
to be complex does not mean to be fragmented . 
this is the paradox and the genius of our Canadian civilization . 
in the contemplation of our wholeness , lies the symbolic importance of the Governor General : the identification of this post with inclusiveness - the inclusiveness that lies at the core of Canadian society , at its best . 
this is the essence of our notorious decency , our infamous desire to do good . 
and it is important to recall that with the great waves of immigration , there has been , since the beginning , an underlying motif : the lost , the rejected , and those who dreamed of another life would come here and would make a contribution to the whole . 
in a 1913 photograph , a group of Scandinavian immigrants in Larchmont , Ontario is huddled around a blackboard on which is written : 
duties of the Citizen 
understand our government . 
2 . Take an active part in politics . 
3 . Assist all good causes . 
4 . Lessen intemperance . 
5 . Work for others . 
it would be easy to focus obsessively on all the pitfalls and prejudices that undoubtedly landmined this path of good intentions . 
but in examining the intent , you see the underlying central assumption . 
it was expected that the immigrant , along with everyone else , would join in the social process , which was democratic , co - operative and other - directed . 
the fact that it would take another 50 years for this kind of inclusiveness to become colour blind , means , simply , that it took another 50 years . 
but in other countries , it would take a hundred . 
in some , it has never come . 
the essence of inclusiveness is that we are part of a society in which language , colour , education , sex and money need not , should not divide us , but can make us more aware and sensitive to difference . 
i learned to be a Canadian through a series of eternally virginal public school teachers , who treated me only as bright - and not bright yellow . 
they were mostly small - town Ontario women who , given some of our history might have been narrow - minded ; but without exception they had the ability to reach out and understood , instinctively , the need for compassion and the stirring of imaginative curiosity . 
luckily , all of us came to a land where the aboriginal peoples have always dreamed life into being . 
it is customary to talk about how hard immigrants work and how ambitious they are , but those of us who have lived that process , know that it is mainly the dream that counts . 
i ' m not talking here of fantasy . 
i am talking of the true dream that is caught in the web of the past as it meets the wind of the future . 
all of us have this , even if we do not express it . 
this is what gives a nation , such as ours , its resonance , its depth and its strength . 
the dream brings openness , adventure and , of course , pain and confusion . 
but , as Leonard Cohen observes , " There is a crack in everything . 
that ' s how the light gets in '' . 
through the light that is in us , we have created a place of dynamic innovation . 
innovation in political structures . 
new approaches toward social relationships , towards citizenship . 
we must not see ourselves as a small country of 30 million people , floundering in a large land mass . 
we are among the healthiest , best - educated people in the world , with great natural riches . 
we have two of the world ' s great languages . 
we must not see ourselves as people who simply react to trends but as people who can initiate them . 
we must not see ourselves as people to whom things are done but as people who do things . 
our history demonstrates that we have the self - confidence to act and to act successfully . 
we can - when we trust ourselves - seize hold of the positive energy , flowing out of the choice we have made to be here and to continue what remains an unprecedented experiment . 
the streetcar our family often took on Sunday afternoons to Rockliffe Park , used to pass the closed gates of Rideau Hall . 
i ' m so glad that has changed . 
i ' m delighted that crowds of people now come through the grounds and the Visitor Centre . 
i look forward to continuing the tradition of welcoming Canadians to what is , in effect , your national house . 
but we will not always be in Ottawa . 
John and I intend to travel and re - travel this whole country by plane , train , car , canoe and kayak . 
we are initiating the holding of a public levee in each province and territory we visit . 
you are all invited . 
in ten days we will be in Alberta for our first official provincial trip . 
our first levee will be held on Saturday , October 16 th at 4 p.m. at the Museum of the Regiments in Calgary . 
in November , we will be in British Columbia and our levee will be on Sunday , November 21 st in Vancouver . 
we want to meet as many of you as we can , not only on special occasions at Rideau Hall and at La Citadelle in Quebec City , but where you live and make your lives . 
we bring to this new work , a deep commitment to the relationship between francophone and anglophone , which is the essential and central fact of our political history . 
we have already long - established , personal interests in French immersion schooling , shelter for the fragile in our society and human rights . 
and I am committed , as I have always been , to affirming and furthering the full expression of that more than half of society to which I belong - a group which modestly calls itself women . 
we also have a history of deep involvement in and love for the arts. 
beauty and excellence are not the property of a select group . 
they are the means by which we most profoundly express our society and they belong to every one of us . 
as I take up this task , I ask you to embark on a journey with me . 
together , I hope that we will be able to do it with the Inuit quality of isuma , which is defined as an intelligence that includes knowledge of one ' s responsibility towards society . 
the Inuit believe that it can only grow in its own time ; it grows because it is nurtured . 
i pray that with God ' s help , we , as Canadians , will trace with our own lives , what Stan Rogers called " one warm line through this land , so wild and savage '' . 
and in the footsteps of Samuel de Champlain , I am willing to follow 
prime Minister of Canada 
at The Installation Ceremony of Governor General 
October 7 , 1999 
Ottawa , Ontario 
your Excellency , Madame Adrienne Clarkson . 
allow me to offer the best wishes of the Government , Parliament and people of Canada as you take the oath of office . 
i would also like to express appreciation to the Right Honourable Romeo LeBlanc and Mrs. Fowler LeBlanc . 
with quiet dignity and abiding good grace , they have left an indelible mark on this high office . 
when he took office in 1995 , this proud Canadian became the first Acadian to serve as Governor General . 
and I know that the opportunity to participate in the 8 th Summit of La Francophonie in his native New Brunswick at the end of his mandate gave him special pleasure . 
i was touched by his show of pride at the historic meeting between French President Jacques Chirac and our Acadian community . 
at the emotional way that Mr. Chirac renewed the unbreakable bond of fraternity that connects Acadians with the home of our ancestors , and praised the exemplary accomplishments of Canada . 
ladies and gentlemen , we are gathered to honour a person of singular talent , discernment and achievement . 
who today becomes the representative of our Head of State in Canada . 
whose selection as Governor General is just one more remarkable stop in an incredible personal journey . 
from this uncertain beginning , the arc of her life has taken a steady upward course . 
an arc that has run parallel with the development of the Canada we know today . 
a cosmopolitan nation . 
at home with our diversity . 
in practice as well as theory . 
her presence here today tells us how far we have come as a nation . 
a nation built by immigrants . 
by those who sought our national dream and our safe haven . 
it is not for me to tell Canadians what they already know about Madame Clarkson . 
her list of accomplishments as a journalist and commentator speaks for itself . 
but I would like to say a few words about that special quality that makes her so worthy of this office at this time in our history . 
we live in a time of globalization . 
across time - zones , borders and cultures . 
and in which we wonder what place there will be for diversity . 
what room to protect and nurture unique voices and experiences . 
as few others , Madame Clarkson has sensed the essential harmony in that distinctive blend of voices and experiences that gives Canadian culture its unique flavour . 
blessed with extraordinary insight , she has put her gifts to work creating venues of expression for our artists , musicians and writers . 
from every corner of our great land . 
from all backgrounds and walks of life . 
above all , I believe that her selection as Governor General sends a powerful message . 
one that makes clear our resolve as a nation to ensure that our voices and our stories remain a vibrant part of our shared experience . 
and a vital aspect of a strong and distinctive Canadian presence in the global village . 
one of bright dreams and dark nightmares . 
when we often had reason to wonder whether there was any hope for the world . 
for me , the success of Canada has been about proving - to ourselves and the world - that there is always hope . 
Madame Clarkson , your experiences and success fortify me in this belief . 
on behalf of all Canadians , I thank you for accepting these new responsibilities . 
and I also wish to extend my thanks and best wishes to Mr. Saul . 
i know he will be an able companion in the days to come . 
i wish you every success in the service of the best country in the world .

house OF COMMONS 
Wednesday , October 13 , 1999 
the House met at 2 p.m. 
prayers 
the Speaker : 
it is Wednesday and since it is also our first full sitting day , we will now begin by singing O Canada under the direction of the member for Wentworth - Burlington . 
[ editor ' s note : 
members sang the national anthem ] 
statements BY MEMBERS 
gasoline PRICING 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi - Baie - James - Nunavik , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in recent months , the people of Abitibi - T é miscamingue and I find the price of gasoline too high in Abitibi compared with other regions of Quebec . 
except in a national emergency , the federal government does not have jurisdiction to directly regulate the price of gasoline . 
the Canadian Constitution gives the provinces the authority to regulate prices . 
only Prince Edward Island and Quebec have taken any action in this regard , although Newfoundland announced recently that it would look at the statute provisions that would permit it to regulate the price of gas . 
other provinces preferred to rely on market forces as the most effective means of determining the appropriate prices , while retaining the incentives that contribute to innovation and cost reduction . 
the Government of Quebec has no choice : it will have to rely on the market forces and provide incentives for the people of Abitibi - T é miscamingue . 
* * * 
MENNONITES 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott ( Wanuskewin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to recognize the 125 th anniversary of Mennonites coming to Canada from Russia . 
one would be hard pressed to imagine what the province of Saskatchewan would be like if not for the hardworking , God - fearing Mennonites who chose to come to our country so many years ago . 
the positive influence of these men and women remains with us today . 
the contribution of the Mennonites to our present way of life is almost too difficult to enumerate . 
agriculture , cuisine , churches , enterprise and innovation are all areas that were influenced as this group settled and took root in the valley area north of Saskatoon , Saskatchewan . 
it is a testimony to God ' s enduring goodness that these Mennonite farmers , teachers , preachers and entrepreneurs flourished in this new land with harsh climate extremes and political uncertainties . 
i am pleased to be a descendant of the Neufeld clan and wish to extend my congratulations to all my constituents of Mennonite heritage on the occasion of this special anniversary . 
* * * 
safe COMMUNITIES COALITION 
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to recognize the achievements of the Safe Communities Coalition of Brockville and District . 
in the past three years they have worked with community partners to spread the message to local businesses and throughout the community that 100 % of accidents are preventable . 
in fact , last Tuesday I attended a luncheon where over 100 local businesses divided up $ 76,000 in rebates from the Worker Safety and Insurance Board under their Safe Communities Incentive Program . 
thanks to the coalition , Brockville is fast becoming one of the safest communities in Canada to live , work and play . 
* * * 
hockey 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , hockey is our game and we play it best . 
as we close the century it is fitting to acknowledge the game of the century , which took place 27 years ago on September 28 , 1972 . 
on that date the Canada - U.S.S.R. series , 480 minutes of nail - biting , heart - stopping hockey , was decided by only one goal with 30 seconds left in the game . 
everyone in my hometown of Sault Ste. Marie was riveted to their television sets to watch Team Canada and two of its favourite sons , Phil and Tony Esposito , who were instrumental in Team Canada ' s victory . 
in fact , it was Phil Esposito who set Henderson up for the winning goal . 
much has changed since that afternoon in 1972 but the people from my hometown will never forget this exciting series . 
there has not been one like it since . 
the Sault is very proud of Phil and Tony Esposito . 
* * * 
world POPULATION 
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 12 the Canadian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development celebrated its second anniversary with a forum in commemoration of the six billion mark of world population . 
the day of six billion is a significant milestone in the history of population growth . 
in only 12 short years the world has realized an addition of one billion people , nearly half of whom are under 25 years of age . 
every year 78 million people are added to the planet and over 95 % of this growth is in developing countries . 
this growing population of young people has yet to have the right and access to reproductive health services and information . 
the international community can address these problems which seriously impair their quality of life . 
i call upon Canada and all nations who are signatories to the Cairo Programme of Action to honour their commitment to put basic human needs of girls , men and women - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Calgary Northeast . 
* * * 
gulf WAR VETERANS 
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is time for the government to acknowledge the existence of gulf war syndrome . 
watching from the visitors ' gallery today are gulf war veterans Louise Richard , Maurice Binard and Susan Roirdon , wife of Terry Roirdon , whose death this April was officially caused by gulf war syndrome . 
captain Roirdon died in the prime of his life . 
they represent over 2,000 more infected soldiers . 
these veterans came to the Hill today to ask the government for answers . 
they deserve that much . 
they also deserve treatment . 
the Liberal government has been unwilling to acknowledge or treat gulf war illness . 
veterans are frustrated , sick and dying . 
they are tired of getting no response from the government . 
Canadian forces personnel are misdiagnosed , undiagnosed , untreated , then released from the service . 
these veterans have waged - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra .

ROBERT MUNDELL 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadian economist Robert Mundell has won the Nobel Prize for economic sciences for his analysis of exchange rates and their effect on monetary policies . 
professor Mundell graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1953 and received his Ph . D . from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956 . 
he has taught at Stanford , Johns Hopkins , McGill and Waterloo . 
in the 1960 s he published a pioneering study on the short term effects of monetary and fiscal policy in an open economy . 
his theoretical constructs were studied by the European Union ' s leaders and were influential in developing plans for a single Eurocurrency . 
* * * 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , never before have the Espoirs de Laval so lived up to the hope expressed in their name . 
last week , one of the club members , Genevi è ve Jeanson , made the news with a marvelous accomplishment : two junior cycling championships within the same week . 
this is a first in road cycling in Quebec and in Canada . 
Genevi è ve ' s exceptional success is already being lauded as the sporting event of the year . 
Genevi è ve has already set her sights high for the future . 
starting next year , she will move up to the senior ranks and she has hopes of earning a spot on the Canadian team . 
this 18 - year old athlete ' s maturity , tenacity and discipline have made her a model for an entire generation of young people . 
it takes a huge amount of determination and hard work '' . 
Genevi è ve , has every right to those high hopes . 
the Sydney Olympics await her . 
we of the Bloc Quebecois tip our hats to her , and it is with the greatest of pride that we offer our congratulations and best wishes for continued success . 
* * * 
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Vaudreuil - Soulanges , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to quote Edgar Fruitier , Jean - Louis Millette , man of the theatre , relentless perfectionist and actor extraordinaire , let his audience down for the first time in his career when he made his final exit on September 29 . 
jean - Louis Millette the actor also left his mark on the culture of Quebec , through Quebec television . 
he also enjoyed a career in film where he often played seedy , disturbed or downright fiendish characters . 
when interviewed last year , Millette himself said the best way to keep death at bay was to work passionately for as long as one ' s strength and time permitted . 
we offer him this richly deserved tribute , along with our sincere condolences to his family members . 
thanks so much for all the memories , Jean - Louis Millette . 
* * * 
PAKISTAN 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the democratic government of Pakistan was overthrown by a military coup . 
in this context we must remember that Pakistan has had several military governments in the past and that its political culture is complex . 
the official opposition supports the restoration of the democratic government in Pakistan . 
the stability of Pakistan , a nuclear power since last year , is crucial to this region . 
we understand the concerns of Canadians of Pakistani descent . 
that said , Canada should not make any rash decision to impose sanctions or talk about suspending anyone from the Commonwealth . 
the blustering we heard from the foreign affairs ministers yesterday was a typical overreaction . 
we oppose sanctions and threats . 
instead , why does the government not encourage Pakistan ' s Asian neighbours , the IMF and the World Bank to put pressure on this military regime ? 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the opposition apparently did not appreciate the throne speech , which sets out the broad priorities of our government , nor did it take kindly to the government ' s interest in the quality of life of the Canadian public . 
the opposition did not like it that our government wants to give priority to maintaining a strong Canadian economy that will create jobs . 
and it was not at all pleased that our government is interested in our children . 
no matter . 
let the opposition go on with its search for identity and its in - fighting . 
in the meantime , the Liberal government will pursue its objective of improving the quality of life of all Canadians . 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the empty promises , hollow rhetoric and vague commitments in yesterday ' s throne speech were sweet nothings that Canadians have come to expect from the Liberals . 
what really cried out in this throne speech were the appalling gaps . 
we heard about a children ' s agenda that does not include children or child care . 
we heard a passing reference to homelessness , but nothing about providing affordable housing . 
we heard about the knowledge based economy , but nothing about ensuring that all Canadians have access to high quality education . 
if the Liberal government would for one moment stop the din and clatter of vague , meaningless pronouncements about nothing , what would it hear ? 
in the deafening silence that remains it might hear the real priorities of Canadians . 
* * * 
social UNION 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Liberal government announced how it was going to go about implementing the social union framework agreement : absolute spending authority in just about every sector , from early childhood to education , health , culture , and a host of other jurisdictions exclusive to Quebec . 
from now on , two instruments will underpin this increasingly unitary Canada : the Constitution , 1982 , and the social union agreement , neither of which has been approved by the National Assembly and both of which have been denounced by every premier of Quebec . 
yesterday ' s throne speech mentioned Quebec only once and then only to give it a clear warning . 
the provinces are being reduced to the level of municipalities and community groups . 
there is the federal government , which was referred to as national yesterday , and the rest . 
what part of this vision is still federal ? 
what has become of flexibility ? 
in the eyes of this government , Quebec no longer exists . 
will things be taken to their logical conclusion and the abolition , pure and simple , of the provinces proposed ? 
* * * 
parliamentary COMMITTEES 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , although parliamentary Standing Order 106 ( 2 ) states that the chair of all parliamentary committees will be selected by the members of that committee , the Globe and Mail reports that the transport minister has already chosen the MP from Hamilton West to chair the new transport committee . 
as well , the transport minister has established the agenda , which will include presentations by himself and Mr. Gerald Schwartz . 
the minister has instructed his Liberal MPs on the committee on how to vote for the chair before the committee has even met . 
this violates the spirit and the process described in Standing Order 106 ( 2 ) . 
will the minister stop interfering and just allow the transport committee to function as defined in the standing orders ? 
* * * 
national HOCKEY LEAGUE 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Saturday I was watching the Leaf game with my seven year old son , Patrick , who plays tyke hockey in Toronto . 
when a fight broke out on the ice my reaction was to change the channel . 
this is not behaviour my son nor his teammates are being taught . 
how do I explain to my children that violence and in particular fighting , both on and off the ice , is wrong when they see professional hockey players fighting on the ice ? 
fighting is illegal in Canada . 
it is a criminal offence whether it is taking place on a street corner or on an NHL rink . 
why is it then that we seem to have two standards of justice ? 
why is the NHL above the law ? 
the NHL has an obligation to put a stop to fighting . 
what kind of role models are we putting forward to the millions of Canadian boys and girls who watch and play hockey ? 
if the NHL does not step in , then the government should insist that the police and prosecutors lay criminal charges . 
fighting in the NHL is disgraceful and it has to stop for the sake of our children . 
* * * 
canada 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada is one of the great success stories of the 20 th century and British Columbia is a very important part of that success . 
our government has restored the nation ' s finances and modernized programs paving the way for sustained economic growth and job creation to build the future for Canadians . 
it is through this government ' s vision of working together that has made Canada the best place to live in the world and will continue to be in the 21 st century . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to be back for the fall session after a rather unusual summer . 
we had Tories joining the Liberals . 
we had NDP joining the Tories . 
we had Joe Clark united with Joe Clark , and Reformers were fighting each other . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition . 
Mr. Preston Manning : 
Mr. Speaker , Reformers were fighting each other , so maybe it was not that unusual after all . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
why should Canadians believe any of the promises of tax relief in the throne speech after six straight years of Liberal tax grabs ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are very happy to be back too . 
there was some movement . 
we are sorry that the Reform Party might disappear or end up as some type of not very united alternative . 
Canadians are very happy with the performance of the government . 
all Liberal members who have been in their ridings have reported to the caucus this morning that the people are extremely happy that we have no more deficit and that we have already started to reduce taxes . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
the Speaker : 
i am giving a little bit of room today but not lots and lots of room . 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we got sharper responses when we were handling the question period by ourselves . 
this summer I visited a lot of Canadians at their places of work : at factories , plants , offices and so forth . 
what these people are interested in is take home pay . 
they will not believe any promise of tax relief unless the federal government takes a smaller bite from their paycheques . 
why should Canadian workers believe any of these promises on tax relief when the federal deduction from their paycheques week after week and month after month keeps increasing rather than decreasing ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
there was a surtax of 3 % imposed by the Tories some years ago because of the deficit . 
that is no longer there . 
there are 600,000 Canadians who are not paying any more taxes because my Minister of Finance brought in some good budgets . 
we will keep doing that in a rational , reasonable and sensible way . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once before the Prime Minister promised tax relief . 
he was going to abolish , get rid of , in other words obliterate the GST . 
with a record like that and with statements like that on the record why should Canadians believe they are going to get real tax relief out of the Prime Minister ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we came here we said we were going to reduce the deficit to zero . 
they did not believe us but we did it . 
we have an agreement on that . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we clear all the rhetoric away from yesterday ' s throne speech what are we left with ? 
no tax cuts , just a commitment to spend a whole lot more . 
the stark reality is that on January 1 the first act of the government in the new millennium will be to raise payroll taxes and personal income taxes through bracket creep . 
why does the finance minister not simply admit that after all the smoke has cleared from yesterday ' s throne speech what we are left with is a big tax hike on January 1 ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can assure the hon. member that on January 1 , as indeed on January 1 of every year since we have taken office , there will be a reduction in payroll taxes . 
it is a perspective that says we will invest in education , we will invest in social programs , and that - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , maybe the finance minister should invest in a watch . 
he has taken up a lot of time . 
we are looking at a finance minister who has a great future behind him . 
instead , he raised taxes 60 times . 
his whole record is a record of tax hikes . 
why does the finance minister not just give it up ? 
why does he not admit that his real agenda is to raise taxes in the next budget ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have told the member a million times not to exaggerate . 
this is a question of credibility . 
the fact is that the Reform Party has no credibility . 
its tax plan in the third year would require a surplus of $ 52 billion . 
that is smoke and mirrors . 
until such time as the Reform Party gives the Canadian people a plan that is based on solid facts it will have no credibility in this debate . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is invoking the social union agreement to justify its forays into provincial jurisdictions . 
it has announced that it will establish a national children ' s agenda , evaluate the effectiveness of social programs , and eliminate unjustified barriers to the mobility of citizens and students . 
let us not forget , however , that this agreement was never signed by Quebec . 
are we to understand that the government intends to impose these new programs without Quebec ' s consent , once again demonstrating the one - sided nature of its flexible federalism ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is forgetting something , because the Government of Quebec went along with the national child benefit . 
it agreed to take the resulting surpluses and reinvest them , because we were investing in families . 
that is what it did and we had its consent . 
we are working with the provinces , although I am well aware that this does not serve the interests of the Bloc Quebecois . 
but since what we are doing is good , as was the case with the national child benefit , the Government of Quebec has had to continue working with us . 
we are going to keep on tackling real problems , particularly those having to do with children . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have the leader of this government to thank for the two instruments driving federal policy : unilateral patriation , in 1982 , and the social union agreement , both opposed by federalists and sovereignists alike in the Quebec National Assembly . 
in the same vein , the government announced that it planned to establish a pharmacare plan . 
but Quebec already has such a plan . 
are we to understand that the only choice open to Quebec will be either to amend its plan , or to forgo the money from the federal program , some of which also belongs to Quebec taxpayers ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
this is how a federation operates . 
it is still the best form of government in the world . 
as President Clinton said last Friday , federalism is always the best solution in a modern society . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Speech from the Throne the government has committed to eliminating the barriers it claims impede the mobility of citizens within Canada . 
we are aware of the tensions that exist between Ontario and Quebec in the area of construction . 
can the Prime Minister tell us whether this desire of the government to eliminate barriers to mobility means that it wishes to interfere in the discussions currently under way between Quebec and Ontario relating to construction ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is a dialogue at the present time between the Government of Quebec and the Government of Ontario relating to protectionism in the field of construction . 
i believe there should be an agreement to enable people to work anywhere in Canada that there is work , and to prevent excessive protectionism , which is detrimental to economic growth in any part of Canada . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is getting into a particularly hot issue as far as Quebec construction workers are concerned . 
perhaps he should think twice about doing so . 
in another area of concern to us , again in connection with barriers to mobility , does the Prime Minister consider that the provisions of Law 101 relating to the language of work in Quebec constitute an obstacle to mobility ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is the problem . 
i deal with federal problems . 
living here in Ottawa , I have had the opportunity to see that there are far more Quebecers working in Ontario than there are Ontarians working in Quebec .

agriculture 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there is a crisis on the farm and the government does not care . 
forty - six per cent of prairie grain and oilseed producers could be out of business this time next year if the government does not act . 
our farmers are as efficient as any in the world , but the government has destroyed crucial agricultural support . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
why was the throne speech silent on the greatest , most serious farm crisis since the Great Depression ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has been working on the problem for a long time . 
we put $ 900 million aside in the last budget for resolving this problem . 
this was long before the summer . 
at this time the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food is communicating with his counterparts in Manitoba and Saskatchewan . The solution to this problem will come from both levels of government working together . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , being in communication is not exactly a solution . 
yesterday the Speech from the Throne was supposed to be about children , yet today children on the prairies are watching their farm families and farm communities fall apart . 
there was not even a mention in the throne speech . 
can the Prime Minister explain to these children why they do not count ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we had a Speech from the Throne where the main item was the future of children in Canada . 
it is a very big preoccupation for the government . 
probably she did not read the same Speech from the Throne as the minister of finance of British Columbia who said " I would give it seven or eight out of ten ; I think the spirit is right in most areas '' . 
thank you for the compliment we received from the NDP .

fisheries 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the 1990 Sparrow decision giving natives the right to conduct a food fishery should have sent warning bells when Donald Marshall Jr. appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada to fight his conviction for illegal fishing . 
given the Marshall decision and the ample time the government has had to study all possible scenarios coming out of the supreme court ruling , can the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans explain why his department was so ill prepared to respond to the supreme court ruling ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on the contrary , we have acted in a very expeditious manner . 
we believe in dialogue and co - operation . 
that is what works . 
it has paid off . 
it is working . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the reason that the native fishing issue has escalated so dramatically is that the minister ' s department had no plan regarding the court ruling , no ideas , and exercised none of the leadership that the minister should have been exercising . 
can the minister now explain why DFO was caught so off guard ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
that is co - operation and that is dialogue . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech yesterday did not even address the serious racial conflict which has erupted in the New Brunswick lobster fishery . 
ethnic tensions have escalated and that is inexcusable for the government . 
who was that ? 
it was the current Prime Minister speaking in 1969 . 
why , 30 years later , is he still ranking Canadians according to their bloodlines ? 
why would that be ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be clear . 
we have a different position from the Reform Party . 
the Reform Party believes that if everybody is treated the same , it means everybody is treated equally . 
i have three children . 
i treat them equally but I do not treat them the same . 
as a country we were built taking into consideration the regional differences across the country . 
we want to make sure we include Canadians and take into consideration the needs of Canadians right across the country . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what part of equal might the minister not understand ? 
let us take a quote from the great guru of Liberal wisdom , and that would be Pierre Trudeau where in 1969 he said : 
that was a Liberal . 
i would like to ask the Prime Minister what has changed his mind since then ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was there and there is some - 
miss Deborah Grey : 
Mr. Speaker , he said it in 1969 . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
Mr. Speaker , yes . 
in 1760 there was a royal proclamation that gave the national government an obligation to respect the treaties with the people who were here before the white people came . 
this is a treaty . 
this is a contract . 
a government has to respect obligations that were signed either yesterday or 300 years ago .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the minister suspended the Competition Act , the airline industry has been in crisis . 
yet nowhere in the throne speech is there any mention of the serious problem facing the industry , particularly in Quebec , where thousands of jobs are at stake . 
will the government tell us why it has absolutely nothing to say in the throne speech on this topic , when this is something that actually comes under its jurisdiction ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously , there were problems with Canada ' s airline industry , particularly with the weak opposition from Canadian Airlines . 
as a government , we have three options : first , we can provide financial assistance for Canadian ; second , the company can declare bankruptcy ; third , we can seek another solution . 
we have chosen the third option , which is to find a private sector solution , and that is why we resorted to section 47 of the National Transportation Act . 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , everyone is waiting to hear something about the strategic issue of the airline industry in Canada . 
why has the government chosen to remain silent about this in the throne speech , when it has found something to say about all sorts of matters that are none of its business ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in our view , the situation is very serious and I am therefore prepared to answer questions in the House of Commons . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government had months to develop a response to the Marshall decision and it did not . 
it had years to develop a fisheries management policy for this country and it has not . 
under this Liberal government Canada now has a race based fisheries policy from coast to coast . 
a fisherman ' s livelihood is contingent upon his parent ' s bloodlines . 
i would like to ask the minister why he has allowed race to become a cornerstone of fisheries policy in this country . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said earlier , clearly we have a different point of view on this side . 
our view on aboriginals is that we have to include all Canadians to make sure they can participate . 
we have to make sure that we respect the treaties that we have signed . 
that is exactly what we are doing and that is exactly what we are going to do . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fisheries minister is of no comfort to lobster fishermen who are afraid of losing their livelihoods . 
he is of no comfort to native families who are now facing unfair recriminations from their neighbours . 
he is certainly of no comfort to those who are concerned about the pillaging of lobster stocks . 
i went to the east coast . 
i saw the problem developing and I suggested a solution to the minister which was a way out of the mess we are in now . 
i would like to ask the minister why he failed to ask the supreme court to stay the decision and take a rehearing of this judgment . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us examine the position of the Reform Party . 
the Mi ' kmaq people , after 240 years , a quarter of a millennium , were given a treaty right . 
what the Reform Party wanted to do right away was to take that right away from the aboriginal people . 
we will not do that . 
* * * 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , without even once using the word education , yesterday ' s Speech from the Throne made reference to learning , skills development , knowledge , and internship programs . 
can the Prime Minister now admit that his government wants to implement a national education policy , when this is not an area within its jurisdiction ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if they do not want to get into areas of provincial jurisdiction , the throne speech states that they want to " eliminate barriers to the mobility of citizens " - I am quoting from page 21 , to be exact - particularly those barriers " that deny some students use of their student loans when they study out - of - province '' . 
are we to understand that the government in Ottawa , after having inaugurated its millennium scholarship program , now wants to attack the award criteria for loans and bursaries that are in place in Quebec ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what we are seeking is equality for everyone , for everyone to be able to go anywhere in Canada to further their education . 
i believe it would be very good for Canada if people from the English speaking provinces could go to Quebec to study , and if people from Quebec could go to study in the rest of Canada under the same conditions . 
i feel that this is ideal , because everyone would gain from it . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the throne speech failed to mention the massive restructuring that Canada ' s airlines are about to face . 
air Canada and Canadian Airlines were in merger discussions six months prior to section 47 being invoked . 
could the minister please explain to Canadians why he invoked section 47 when he did ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is true it now appears that the two airline companies were having discussions earlier this year . 
in the month of March , Air Canada was the first to raise with my officials the use of section 47 . 
we now know that it was in connection with those discussions , but no action was taken and there was no formal request because the talks fell apart . 
in June of this year , first Air Canada , with its proposal for the Canadian Airlines international routes , and then Canadian Airlines came to us and talked about a need to restructure the industry . 
that is why we used section 47 . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the government failed to provide Canadians with its vision of our airline industry in the new millennium . 
one can only assume that it does not have one . 
why has the government failed to provide Canadians with some indication of its vision of Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is committed to a viable , strong and stable airline industry , but it is undergoing some very difficult problems , problems that will necessitate some very difficult choices on the part of Canadians and especially members in this House . 
we want a full debate in the House to elicit the views of hon. members on both sides of the House so we can develop an airline policy that will deal with the difficult matters we have to overcome in order to have a very strong and viable airline system in the 21 st century . 
* * * 
employment INSURANCE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the disastrous consequences of EI reform are well known . 
nearly 60 % of unemployed workers , youth and women in particular , do not qualify . 
this reform is creating poverty in Canada . 
setting aside the parental leave plan , will the minister explain why she has been unable to convince her Cabinet colleagues that the best way of fighting poverty is to restore access by the unemployed to the EI system , which is their ultimate safety net ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member speaks about employment insurance . 
that is one part of the government ' s strategy to help Canadians get jobs . 
all these are our government ' s approach to helping Canadians find and keep jobs . 
* * * 
peacekeeping 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) : 
will the minister inform the House of Canada ' s response to a call for humanitarian assistance as we commit resources and expertise to the UN peacekeeping efforts in East Timor ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
it was rather risky but we did that . 
we are monitoring the situation and in a few days I will be in a position to announce in the House some additional assistance as the situation in East Timor becomes such that we can go in and actually do our job in there as well . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the Prime Minister verbally proved he does not understand the farm income crisis , let alone able to devise a solution . 
let us try the agriculture minister . 
there is a 98 % drop in realized net income and not a whisper of concern in yesterday ' s throne speech . 
there was no any mention of children going hungry or parents wondering if they could stay on the farm . 
farmers never knew how far away Ottawa was until yesterday . 
my question is for the minister of agriculture . 
why is the plight of thousands of farm families not a priority for the agriculture minister and the government ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the opposition and all Canadians that even prior to last year ' s budget in February the government announced $ 900 million and , along with the provincial contribution , $ 1.5 billion to assist producers who are under stress and need that help across Canada . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government cannot in good conscience allow farmers to head into winter with no hope . 
the government likes to throw around compassionate sounding buzzwords such as the children ' s agenda . 
there are thousands and thousands of farm children whose parents are trying desperately to make ends meet . 
real children need real help and the government is turning its back . 
if the agriculture minister and government are truly interested in helping children , what do they plan to do for them to get them through this winter ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
we will continue to do all we can to find all the resources we can in co - operation with the provinces and the industry to assist all those that we can assist . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister has said that the Onex takeover of Air Canada is strictly a private sector issue . 
the Minister of Transport has said that there might be some public interest at stake . 
has the Liberal government made up its mind ? 
will it listen to Canadians or let only shareholders decide the fate of our Canadian airline industry ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said earlier , we have chosen a market driven solution as the option for us to follow at this stage . 
it is up to the parties in the private sector to determine any arrangements in reorganizing the companies . 
once the private sector determines that , and once a conditional offer comes to the government , the government will be fully engaged in making sure that the five principles I enunciated a couple of weeks ago are adhered to and that the protection for Canadians on prices and other issues in the public interest is rigorously adhered to . 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister ' s market driven solution and his five principles just will not cut it . 
Canadians were promised a healthy competition within the airline industry when it was deregulated . 
instead we have seen fewer flights , wages driven down , jobs threatened , reduced service , more American influence and less Canadian influence , and now a weakened major airline . 
will the government now admit that its policy on deregulation has been an utter failure ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to make the assertion the hon. member does about deregulation is a very facile way to approach the debate . 
deregulation had many successes but there is no question that severe problems have occurred in the last few years especially with one company , Canadian Airlines . 
those issues have to be addressed and addressed in a way that protects the public interest to ensure that as we go into the next century we have a very viable air industry . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if conservation of lobster stocks is of primary importance , will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans insist that native fishers abide by the same seasons as non - native fishers ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I assure the member and the House that conservation is a priority . 
we shall ensure that we protect the resource . 
however we do have a judgment of the supreme court . 
i took great honour in recognizing that treaty right and will ensure that we live in the spirit of the judgment . 
we need to focus on the long term and make sure that we bring everybody around the table to work on a long term arrangement to fulfil and ensure that the Mi ' kmaq and the Maliseet can exercise their treaty rights . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have another question for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
in the short term the lobster fishery is regulated by licences , trap limits , size restrictions , seasons and lobster fishing areas . 
regulations ensure conservation and conservation ensures a viable fishery . 
how could the minister allow any fishery not to based on conservation ? 
will the minister answer that question ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , all fisheries are based on conservation . 
there is no fishery that is not based on conservation . 
as I said in my statement last week , if there is a fishery it will be a regulated fishery . 
i assure the hon. member that the fisheries out there now are regulated . 
we are enforcing conservation practice and conservation rules . 
* * * 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. George Proud ( Hillsborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of National Defence . 
in light of its embarrassing performance and inability to get to East Timor in time , could the minister tell the House when the government will replace the old and unreliable Hercules aircraft ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is unfortunate that one aircraft took a number of attempts to get off to the mission in East Timor . 
i must say that it was the high maintenance standards of our crew that ensured that the safety of our personnel was of paramount importance . 
when the plane was fixed it did get off . 
it was one of the earliest to arrive in East Timor and it has provided terrific service to the allied troops that are there . 
in addition , it is going through an upgrade . 
the avionics and navigation systems are going through an upgrade in the last couple of years and over the next couple of years so that they will continue to provide excellent service .

immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , people smuggling is rampant in Canada . 
boatloads of human cargo land on our shores . 
our airports are increasingly becoming sieves for illegal migrants and the government does not even care enough to prosecute the captains involved in people smuggling . 
Canadians , especially new immigrants , have called on the government to make this issue a priority , yet there is no mention of it whatsoever in the throne speech . 
why is the smuggling of human cargo , the enslavement of thousands of people and the infiltration of organized crime not important to the government ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech identified that people smuggling as a great concern to the government . 
we will not tolerate trafficking in human lives . 
the concerns we have when it comes human smuggling is that not only does it endanger the lives of the people who are in the hands of transnational organized crime but it diverts our attention from genuine refugees . 
nine people have been charged and they are presently before the courts . 
we have the toughest laws and we are looking at making them even tougher to ensure that smugglers know they will not succeed in Canada . 
* * * 
organized CRIME 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in light of the threats made by organized crime against Quebec farmers , their families , and even my colleague , the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , regarding the illegal growing of marijuana , would the Minister of Justice not have been better advised to table effective legislation in the House in order to finally do something about organized crime , instead of drafting legislation that Quebec does not want , legislation that would brand young offenders for life ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fact is that organized crime does exist . 
that is why fighting organized crime is the number one law enforcement priority of the government . 
i assure my hon. colleague that the RCMP has supported the SQ in fighting organized crime in Quebec against the farmers . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in light of the Marshall decision the severe lack of leadership has caused a devastating effect among the lobster fishermen in my home province of Nova Scotia . 
will the minister commit the necessary resources to help the Bay of Fundy inshore fishermen reach a co - operative settlement with aboriginal people for the future of the lobster fishery ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in fact I went to Moncton and met with the commercial people . 
i also spent a whole day with the aboriginal people . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
i would ask hon. members to try to contain their exuberance . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal : 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party which makes the most noise spends the least amount of time with the aboriginal community hearing about aboriginal concerns . 
i went to Atlantic Canada and in fact encouraged dialogue and discussion . 
i was very happy to see that in Nova Scotia native and non - native fishing communities working together . 
we have said that we needed community based solutions and we have been there encouraging that . 
i am very happy . 
i think we should applaud what is happening there . 
this is the way to resolve the problem . 
we have been working on a long term solution to get all the groups together to have a long term arrangement . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , will the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans confirm here and now that non - native fishers will be included in negotiations on an equal footing with native fishers and the federal government ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have said all along that to resolve these issues we must get all the parties working together toward a common solution . 
i met with the commercial fishermen and the processors . 
i spent two days out there to ensure that I had the benefit of all views . 
i also consulted with all my colleagues on both sides of the House , as well as my counterparts in fisheries . 
we have a solution in place . 
it is working because dialogue and co - operation are working .

labour 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton - Springdale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Labour . 
construction workers at federal work sites deserve to receive not only a fair wage but also fair treatment . 
could the minister tell me what she will do to ensure fair treatment ? 
hon. Claudette Bradshaw ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
the schedule will be posted and the workers will know what their wages should be . 
i would like to thank the unions and the construction workers across the country for helping us to put this in place . 
i am very happy that it has been done . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the taxpayers of Canada ' s largest cities and the provinces bear the brunt of the government ' s bungling on immigration . 
yesterday Toronto ' s mayor , Mel Lastman , said he is tired of the government ' s excuses and his city can no longer afford the Liberal ' s broken immigration system . 
the mayor of Toronto is simply expressing the frustration on immigration felt across this country . 
how does the minister respond to Toronto ' s mayor and Canadians who share his concerns ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my department is working co - operatively with the city of Toronto . 
we are trying to gather the data and the information . 
we know that this requires a response from three levels of government : the federal government , the provincial government and the municipal government . 
i want to point out that the refugee population that the mayor is concerned about represents about 10 % of the concerns that he has and we are working with him to resolve those issues . 
i want to make one point very clear . 
as we do this , the government remains committed , as opposed to the opposition party , to upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; not just for some , but for all .

PAKISTAN 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
subsequent to the military coup d ' etat in Pakistan , serious warnings were issued by the United States , most of the countries of Europe , the European Community , the secretary - general of the Commonwealth , and the head of the IMF . 
all of these called for a return to democracy as quickly as possible , and respect of the Pakistani constitution . 
can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tells us what Canada ' s position is ? 
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have done the same as the other countries . 
in addition , we have also arranged to have a meeting of the Commonwealth ministers on Monday which will apply the Harare principles to Pakistan concerning this military takeover . 
in fact , I think we are ahead of all these other countries .

points OF ORDER 
special DEBATE - FISHERIES 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think you would find unanimous consent to withdraw any existing motions for emergency debates on the fishery issue and to adopt the following : 
that during the said debate : ( 1 ) no member shall speak for more than 20 minutes , with a 10 minute question and comment period being permitted , and provided that time may be divided pursuant to Standing Order 43 ( 2 ) ; and ( 2 ) the Chair shall not receive any quorum calls , dilatory motions or requests for unanimous consent to propose any motion ; and 
that , when no member rises to speak or at 12:00 a.m. , whichever is earlier , the motion shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and the House shall adjourn to the next sitting day . 
the Speaker : 
does the member have the unanimous consent of the House to put the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed .

Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :

there is a procedural motion contained within the report to enable that committee to begin business immediately , and I should like to move concurrence in the first report .

requests FOR EMERGENCY DEBATES 
the Speaker : 
i received six applications for emergency debates for this evening . 
two of them have been withdrawn by the unanimous consent of the House , namely the applications made by the member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough and the member for Delta - South Richmond . 
that leaves me to deal with four others . 
i would ask the hon. members , as I call upon them , to state their case for an emergency debate in a very concise fashion . 
i would first call on the hon. member for Palliser . 
agriculture 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise under Standing Order 52 ( 2 ) to seek leave to propose an emergency debate to address the deepening financial crisis that is affecting far too many Canadian farm families . 
spring flooding has compounded the situation . 
those that escaped the devastation of rising waters continue to be battered by record low commodity prices and highly subsidized competition from producers in the U.S. and Europe . 
without immediate and effective help , up to half of the farmers in western Canada could be out of business by next year . 
i believe that an emergency debate is required in order to urge the government to address this crisis . 
parliament has the responsibility to find long term solutions . 
Mr. Speaker , I would urge you , respectfully , to consider an emergency debate in an immediate and timely fashion . 
the Speaker : 
i will hear the member for Selkirk - Interlake because his request deals with farming . 
i believe from the letter I received that it is in the same genre . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the crisis situation I referred to in my letter to you asking for an emergency debate absolutely involves the statistical analysis of Statistics Canada , which has clearly indicated that farm incomes will be flat and will be dropping as a result of low commodity prices and the actions of our competitors . 
this emergency arises now because last fall the standing committee on agriculture held hearings on the problem . 
as a result of those hearings and the report that was put forward it was determined by the government that the only problem was a sharp drop in income for farmers for 1998 - 99 . 
the fact is , the federal government has addressed a short , two year program that is not providing money to the majority of farmers . 
that is the reason we must have an emergency debate . 
the government has not addressed the issue . 
farmers are going bankrupt . 
calls to the Brandon , Manitoba stress line for farmers are up three times over what they were a year ago . 
we are dealing with a true crisis . 
the number of farm groups coming to Ottawa to stress their point to the minister requires that we in the House debate the issue to bring forward what the real problem is and what the solutions are . 
the Speaker : 
my colleagues from Palliser and Selkirk - Interlake , not diminishing in any way the importance of such a topic , I feel that at this time it does not meet the criteria for an emergency debate . 
i will now hear from the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast . 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 52 , I request leave to make a motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration . 
following a January 1999 British Columbia supreme court decision concerning the possession of child pornography , the British Columbia Court of Appeal did , on June 30 , 1999 , dismiss the appeal to reinstate subsection ( 4 ) of section 163.1 of the Criminal Code . 
the supreme court has scheduled a hearing on this matter for mid - January 2000 . 
given the normal time required for the supreme court judgments , this issue will not be disposed of until perhaps 2001 . 
on February 2 the minister said in the House that the government was acting immediately on the issue and would not wait for the case to reach the Supreme Court of Canada . 
sixty - three Liberal MPs and six senators signed a notice to the Prime Minister asking him to use the notwithstanding clause in this child pornography issue because it was so important last February . 
the children of this country cannot wait until 2001 to find out that child pornography is illegal to possess in Canada . 
we have to debate that issue in the House and come up with a solution to protect our children a lot quicker than the judges of this land want to protect our children . 
the Speaker : 
i do confirm that the hon. member did write to me explaining this particular case , but I do not feel at this time that it meets the criteria for an emergency debate . 
with reference to the member for Lakeland , if there was some confusion and if I did misread the information I had , I will entertain a letter to be sent to me again today so that the hon. member can address his subject tomorrow . 
we will now go to Orders of the Day . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to reply to the Speech from the Throne presented yesterday by Her Excellency the Governor General . 
in doing so I want to take the opportunity on behalf of the official opposition to extend our best wishes to the former Governor General on his retirement as well as our congratulations to the new Governor General on her appointment . 
this summer , my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the region of New Brunswick in which Mr. LeBlanc will be enjoying his retirement , and we can readily understand his desire to live in that magnificent part of the country . 
along with other members of the House , we also had the opportunity to listen to another speech by Her Excellency the Governor General at her swearing in ceremony a week ago . 
i might say it was an excellent speech . 
it was much better than the speech prepared for her by the Prime Minister . 
we wish Her Excellency well in all her future communications . 
i also want to extend on behalf of the official opposition our best wishes to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces both at home and abroad . 
their contributions to maintaining peace in the world are even more significant in light of the hardships and resource limitations that they must endure , not the least of which are those imposed upon them by their own government . 
in the next few days my colleagues will be dissecting the Speech from the Throne in considerable detail , pointing out its deficiencies , which are many , and presenting constructive alternatives . 
my task today is to deal with the big picture which I will now proceed to do . 
for example , over the summer the country faced specific problems demanding government action . 
we heard of some of them today , from people smuggling on the west coast , to violence in the east coast fishery , to an agricultural crisis on the prairies , to the need to completely reorganize the airline industry . 
the Speech from the Throne does not even acknowledge the existence of these problems , let alone offer solutions that are based on some kind of vision of the future for those sectors or some kind of fundamental principles . 
the greatest defect is the deficiency in principle and vision , a deficiency for which the government attempts to compensate with bland rhetoric . 
for example , the government refers in the speech to the principle of clarity as essential to national unity . 
it talks about the importance of principles to the national children ' s agenda . 
in most of the other sections of the speech there is no attempt to specify at all the principles that will guide the government ' s actions . 
let me start with the principles of fiscal responsibility . 
when Reformers were first elected to parliament , we won support on the basis of a commitment to certain clear - cut principles of fiscal responsibility . 
today we are even more committed to those principles because we are even more convinced they are right for Canada and Canadians . 
one of the things that bothers me profoundly is that it can be demonstrated from polling data and research data that there was majority public support in this country as early as 1984 for balancing the federal budget . 
there was majority public support for balancing the federal budget as early as 1984 and yet it took two administrations and 15 years to achieve what for most of us is a self - evident objective that should have been achieved far sooner . 
this Speech from the Throne is rife with government references , bowing and scraping toward the recognition of the global economy and high tech knowledge and computerization . 
it is the benefits that will flow . 
i have a dream . 
it is a simple one and it gets reinforced every time I go to a factory or a plant and talk to workers . 
we are talking about real , substantive tax relief . 
it is quite evident that the Canadian public , and particularly workers , are simply not going to believe promises of tax relief from anyone unless they can see it in a tangible form . 
they are going to look at their paycheques at the end of the day and they will believe they have tax relief when the federal deductions have been reduced . 
they will not believe any other promise or commitment to tax relief unless it shows up on the bottom line . 
this is our vision of tax relief . 
its impact on families could deliver up to $ 4,600 of tax relief per year per family for them to use on whatever they choose , such as education , shelter and clothing . 
we think the people themselves are the best ones to direct those expenditures whether they are socially directed or economically directed . 
but what do we see in the Liberal administration ' s implementation of these principles of fiscal responsibility ? 
we see a government whose main financial priority has been to collect and spend as many taxpayers ' dollars as it can , from $ 107 billion , or almost $ 14,000 in federal tax revenues per family in 1993 , to $ 148 billion , or $ 18,150 in federal tax revenues per family in 1999 , and still growing . 
we read in the Speech from the Throne on page 9 that the government will follow a multi - year plan for tax reduction . 
why would anyone take this at face value when we consider what the government has said and done on this subject in the past ? 
on one occasion the finance minister said that the ultimate goal was to lower taxes but - and unfortunately there is always a but - lowering taxes and reducing the fiscal load would not be possible . 
he then promptly raised federal tax revenues to $ 14,835 per family . 
the next year the finance minister said that we could not have a massive tax cut across the board , and promptly raised federal tax revenues per family to $ 15,614 . 
the next year , speaking about across the board tax cuts , the Prime Minister said " I do not think it is the right thing to do in a society like Canada '' . 
somehow it is un - Canadian to give them back some of their money . 
that year , as if to reinforce the point , the finance minister raised federal revenues per family up to $ 16,550 . 
the next year , along with the budget close to being actually balanced , the finance minister said that to put in place a broadly based tax cut now would be irresponsible . 
that year he raised federal tax revenues per family to $ 18,000 . 
is it any wonder that Canadians will regard tax relief promises from the throne speech with extreme , justifiable scepticism . 
the government ' s taxation record is in precisely the opposite direction to the direction it promises in the throne speech . 
the most deceptive half truth in the entire throne speech is on page 9 . I could hardly believe the statement , when I heard it standing in the other place . 
if it had been in the prospectus of a company filed with the Ontario Securities Commission , this half truth which fails to disclose the other half of the truth , whoever put it together would be liable to spend up to five years in a provincial institution . 
it gets this figure by adding up projected tax reductions for the financial years 1999 - 2000 , 2000 - 01 and 2001 - 02 , for a total of $ 16.5 billion . 
what it fails to mention is that during those same three years it also projects tax increases , namely through increases in CPP premiums and bracket creep , amounting to $ 18.4 billion for a net increase in the tax burden on Canadians of $ 2 billion . 
the first great deficiency in principle and vision that we see in the Speech from the Throne is the lack of principle and substantive commitment to the great principles of fiscal responsibility , in particular tax relief that is the key to both sound government and a prosperous economy for the 21 st century . 
in our judgment , this is a deficiency which cannot be remedied by trying to change tax and spend Liberals into tax cutters . 
it is a deficiency which will only be remedied by the election of 150 - plus members to the House who on a certain night in a certain month - probably February or March - are prepared to stand up in the House and vote for real , genuine , substantive tax relief . 
let me turn to economic policy in general . 
the official opposition ' s vision of an economically prosperous and secure Canada for the 21 st century includes much more than just a fiscally responsible federal government and lower taxes . 
it includes a Canada where jobs with good incomes are plentiful rather than scarce because the job creation engine is fueled , not by patronage - tainted and politically motivated grants , contracts , handouts and subsidies from the government but because it is fueled by dollars left in the pockets of consumers to spend and businesses to invest . 
it is private enterprise . 
it is an old concept but it happens to work . 
we envision a Canada where the younger generation is valued and encouraged by economic opportunity to make their future in Canada rather than being told by the Prime Minister to go to the U.S. if they are not prepared to pay exorbitant taxes . 
talk about a children ' s agenda . 
he is telling our children , " If you don ' t like the tax system here , if you think the levels are too high , go somewhere else '' . 
we envision a Canada where economically disadvantaged regions and people , including aboriginal people , are given the tools to direct and create their own economic future by participating in a free enterprise , market based economy , not a country where aboriginal people are given the obsolete , dependency creating instruments of government planning and socialist economics . 
one of the big reasons we object to the Nisga ' a treaty is that it is straight out of the 19 th century . 
there is no other group in the country that the government would have the nerve to say , " Your economic development is going to be achieved through collective rights and collective ownership of property and resources '' . 
there is no other group that the government would have the nerve to say that to . 
it then hands off those types of tools to aboriginal people . 
exactly the same mistake the country made in the 19 th century we are making as we enter the 21 st century . 
we envision a Canada where challenges faced by agriculture , the infrastructure sector , the airline industry or professional hockey are met by policies that give them tools and frameworks to solve their own problems rather than increasing dependency on the government . 
time does not permit me to deal with all the points in the Speech from the Throne where the Liberal government ' s approach to economic problems or the problems of particular sectors violate these principles , but let me touch on just three examples . 
the first example is the brain drain . 
the official opposition has some of the youngest members in the House . 
many of them spend a lot of time on university campuses and they hear about this problem all the time . 
i hear it every time I go to a campus . 
what is the question that we are asked by younger people at the universities ? 
some person will go to the microphone and say , " I ' m graduating next year with such and such a degree and my wife is graduating with such and such a degree . 
you tell me why I should stay here one day after I graduate '' . 
when I see the new pages in the Chamber I do not just think of the pages as servants of the House . 
i know many of them have ambitions and are studying far beyond spending time here in the House . 
i think of them as representatives of the younger generation who are looking for incentive , opportunity and things like that from government , not punitive taxes that create the opportunities for them somewhere else . 
the government fails to see that high taxes drive youth , capital , jobs and companies out of the country . 
its response to the brain drain is to deny it . 
it does not bring to the problem of the brain drain what free enterprise , market based principles and fiscal responsibility in government can offer those people . 
that is a huge mistake . 
it is a deficiency in principle , not approaching the problem from a principled basis , and a deficiency in vision . 
let us look for a minute at the agriculture situation . 
this summer the member for Selkirk - Interlake and the member for Souris - Moose Mountain arranged for me to spend a little time talking to farmers and producers from southwestern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan . I do not have to tell the members in the House who have a background in agriculture about the depth of the dilemma . 
we have thousands of farmers who have suffered two disasters beyond their control . 
in that particular region , the disaster was an enormous amount of flooded acreage , an inability to seed after the flooding and late seeding leading to frozen crops in the fall . 
we now have the bigger problem of foreign subsidies driving commodity prices down to the point where a large number of our farmers cannot make a living . 
it is worth looking at some of the statistics that the hon. member referred to a minute ago . 
statistics Canada confirmed that 1998 was a disastrous year for Canada ' s farmers . 
realized net income was down 21 % over the year before . 
agriculture Canada forecasts even worse for 1999 . National realized net income of $ 2.2 billion and that figure includes payments from the government ' s AIDA program . 
the hardest hit will be Saskatchewan where Agriculture Canada predicts a net loss of $ 48 million . 
Manitoba will fare only slightly better earning $ 64 million , a little less than the net realized farm income of Prince Edward Island . 
this is one of the great agricultural provinces of the prairies yet that is what its net income is . 
i ask the Prime Minister to listen to this . 
put another way , the realized net income for all farmers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan taken together will be down 98 % from the previous four year average . 
i cannot imagine that if any other group had statistics show that its net realized income had fallen 98 % because of something beyond its control the government would not respond . 
however , in the Speech from the Throne there is no visionary response to this problem . 
i do not want to labour this but I will read the statistics . 
i have been going to farm meetings ever since I belonged to a 4 - H club in the Horse Hill area of Alberta in the 1950 s . 
i have gone to all kinds of agricultural meetings with different commodity groups , et cetera . 
at some of the meetings we went to this summer we talked to people in this dilemma . 
i cannot recall ever having seen people who could not even talk about the problem . 
it was not because of their bottom lines but because they were losing the farm that their grandfather had . 
it was because of what it was doing to their families , the stress lines that the hon. member mentioned . 
people are calling for help from psychiatrists , ministers and everybody else and the government does not respond . 
the government has to do three things . 
it must first recognize that its AIDA program is a joke and is not working . 
the agriculture minister goes around saying that the government has promised farmers $ 25 or $ 50 an acre to put together with the provinces . 
i defy the government to find one farmer who has actually received $ 25 an acre . 
some farmers pay $ 500 to accountants to fill out the forms to get $ 40 back while others pay $ 500 only to be told that they do not qualify for anything . 
nobody gets what is in the press releases because there are a whole lot of strings attached : what was their last three years ' average ; what is their deductible , et cetera . 
there are 100 reasons for not getting the money . 
they want to know where the replacement for AIDA is and they want it fast . 
secondly , where is the expanded crop insurance program that includes disaster relief ? 
this business of inventing a new ad hoc program every time there is a natural disaster is crazy . 
why do we not extend crop insurance to include broad based disaster insurance ? 
Thirdly - and this is one for the prime minister - where is the team Canada mission to Europe that is not just a glad - handing exercise but includes the prime minister , the minister of trade , the foreign minister and the agriculture minister and which makes a powerful argument with the Europeans that their subsidies are killing our farmers ? 
if we are committed to free trade , and the government professes to be committed to free trade , this is not just knocking down trade barriers and subsidies at home . 
yes , it does include that and we have supported that , but it also means being even more vigorous at knocking down the other guy ' s trade barriers . 
if the prime minister has great influence with President Clinton , why does he not use it on behalf of the farmers ? 
if Canada and the U.S. teamed up to fight European subsidies rather than the U.S. just outbidding them , we could have an impact on those subsidies which are killing our farmers . 
i suspect the reason the government does not take this approach is because it really is not committed to market based , free enterprise ways of solving this problem . 
it will cut our subsidies but it does not go after the other guys . 
there is one other sector where I see a deficiency in the government ' s approach which is again a backward looking approach . 
the speech states nothing at all about the need for north - south trade corridors , the need to build the transportation networks and rebuild the transportation networks that are moving a billion dollars of trade a day across the American borders . 
if the government looked at that it would soon come to the conclusion that there are not enough dollars in the public works budget of the Government of Canada and the highways departments of all the provinces to even meet the physical infrastructure investment requirements of the west . 
if we add them all up , there is not enough to even meet the requirements for building infrastructure in the west over the next 20 years . 
what does that mean ? 
it means we are going to have to find massive amounts of capital for investment and infrastructure from other sources . 
i say that the only place we are going to find that is in the private sector . 
my conclusion is that the second great deficiency of principle and vision that we see in the Speech from the Throne is the lack of a principled substantive commitment to encouraging and facilitating individual and corporate enterprise and better operations of free markets to solve the actual practical problems in many of these particular sectors . 
i have already spoken of Reform ' s vision of fiscal responsibility and the need for governments to constrain their natural appetites for excessive taxation and misdirected involvement in the economy . 
however , fiscal and economic ideals are not ends in themselves . 
they are but means to more important ends . 
those more important ends for us are social and moral in nature . 
the most important social responsibility is the protection and nurturing of the family . 
let us look at what this throne speech does in those two areas . 
when it comes to criminal justice , we have a vision of Canada as a safe society where people can live their lives , walk on the streets , drive on the highways , go to school , go to work , shop in the stores , visit the parks and live in their homes without fear of harm to themselves or their property or , even worse , fear of harm to their loved ones . 
i think of the many seniors we run into when we are door - knocking as all of us do . 
some of them are women who pioneered in the workforce while raising families . 
many of them are people who built our homes , our towns and our cities . 
do we not owe our seniors more than a pension ? 
do we not have a moral and social obligation to protect their physical safety and to lift the federal government ' s constitutional obligation to create peace and order off the dry pages of the constitution and give people peace and order in the place where they live ? 
it seems to us the only people who are really sticking their necks out to protect citizens from crime are police officers , particularly the ones who work on the streets . 
these are the men and women who literally put their lives at risk every day to make public safety a reality . 
how does the government treat them ? 
it slashes their budgets and it turns their work and their risks into a mockery through a revolving door parole system and an unbalanced justice system . 
when we examine the policies and actions of the government we find them lacking in commitment to this principle . 
let me take the classic illustration of this point from the events of this summer . 
federal law , as everyone in the House knows , provides for the legal entrance into the country of immigrants and genuine refugees . 
however those laws were repeatedly violated this summer by international gangsters smuggling illegal entrants into Canada on our west coast . 
this people smuggling is not only illegal but is a gross affront to the hundreds of thousands of legitimate immigrants and legitimate refugees who have waited patiently in line and fulfilled everything we have asked of them - all the hoops , all the paperwork , all the time delays - in order to have legitimate legal standing in the country . 
the points I am making have been pointed out by official opposition critics for immigration and justice , but I want to repeat them again . 
the official opposition has called for expedited procedures to detect , detain and assess illegal immigrants and to immediately deport those who are not genuine refugees . 
in doing so we are not calling for something unusual or draconian . 
this is what the 1987 amendments to the 1976 Immigration Act were supposed to accomplish . 
why do we not do something about it ? 
the problem is that in 1985 the Singh decision by the supreme court ruled that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to everyone who is physically present in Canada , even if they got here illegally and even if they have no legal standing whatsoever . 
so we hand to those engaged in people smuggling and to illegal entrants , regardless of their status , all the legal tools required to fight deportation hearings , deportation procedures and deportation orders . 
it is an issue of criminal justice . 
we look to the federal government for a solution to make its laws enforceable so that rights granted to persons without legal standing in our country and violating its laws , are not allowed to tarnish or diminish the rights and privileges of those who fully comply with our laws . 
what is the third great deficiency in principle and vision that we see in the speech ? 
it is a lack of principled and substantive commitment to criminal justice reform , in particular reforms which ensure that when the rights of law abiding citizens and victims of crime conflict with the rights of the perpetrators of crime it is the former that prevail over the latter . 
as I said earlier , the social vision of Reformers attaches the highest priority to the protection and nurturing of the family . 
our vision of Canada regards the family as the most important organizational unit of society . 
last weekend was Thanksgiving . 
Mr. Speaker , what are you thankful for ? 
what am I thankful for ? 
well , many things . 
i am thankful for being a Canadian . 
i am thankful for growing up within driving distance of the Rocky Mountains . 
i am thankful for a Christian heritage and for the religious liberty which allows each of us to turn toward God or away from God and to accept the consequences of our own moral decisions . 
i am thankful for political freedoms . 
reformers complain a lot about the political system of the country , but I am thankful for the freedom that allows my friends and me to start a political party and to try to change the government . 
i am most thankful in my life for my family , and I think a lot of members share this . 
what was the most important thing Sandra and I did on Thanksgiving ? 
we spent time with our family , as many other members did . 
i am thankful for the kindness and nurturing of my mother and for the wisdom and example of my late father . 
he was my hero . 
i am thankful for my wife , Sandra , and for the spiritual foundations of our marriage which have enabled us to withstand all the stresses and strains that everybody here knows politics puts on a marriage . 
i am thankful for the effort Sandra makes to keep our family healthy and strong and the way so many of our spouses sacrifice their own interests for us to be playing in this game . 
i am thankful for my own boys who have grown up to be strong and sensible with the help of a lot of other people besides myself , and who can do so many things from fishing to making music to operating computers far better than I can do . 
i am thankful for my daughters ; for their relentless pursuit of excellence in sport and education ; for making life and faith commitments of their own ; for their choices in husbands , the two who are married ; and for the strength that these men bring to our family . 
i am thankful for three precious little grandchildren , with another one on the way , who find love and acceptance and roots in the family while at the same time becoming its brightest promise and prospects for the future . 
i am thankful that such a family allows us to support and care for each other : children , parents , grandparents , great grandparents and siblings , and turn to one another in times of need instead of having no one to turn to other than a stranger on the end of some government telephone line . 
in expressing this thankfulness for family I am not denying for a moment the importance of government services , whether it is health , education or social assistance , that help the well - being of families . 
i am not denying for a moment the harsh realities of all those who because of economic , social or personal circumstances have lost or been denied the benefits of family , or those for whom family has been transformed into a place of violence and insecurity . 
it should not focus on government programs that attempt to substitute for families . 
it should focus first and foremost on supporting the family directly . 
it might start at the beginning , if it had the moral nerve , by defining the rights of the unborn . 
this it will have to do if it intends to reintroduce its bill on reproductive technologies . 
it will have to get into that subject and it would be better to do it sooner rather than later . 
second , if the Liberal government really wants to do something for children , it should state clearly the definitions of marriage and family which it believes are most conducive to the well - being of children . 
on June 8 , 1999 , for example , the House passed by a vote of 216 for and 55 against a resolution moved by the hon. member for Calgary Centre which read as follows : 
that , in the opinion of this House , it is necessary , in light of public debate around recent court decisions , to state that marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others , and that Parliament will take all necessary steps - 
where are the steps ? 
we did not see any in the Speech from the Throne . 
- within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve this definition of marriage in Canada . 
the government ' s support of this motion was a good step but it should be followed by another . 
if the Liberal government really wants to do something for children , it should also clarify the definition of family as the primary biological and social context into which our children are born . 
it is the Reform Party ' s conviction that a family should be defined as individuals related by blood , marriage or adoption . 
members should note that this definition is broad . 
it is not a narrow definition of family . 
it is broad enough to embrace a so - called traditional family , common law relationships , the single parent family and the extended family which is so important to many new Canadians . 
affirming these definitions of marriage and the family is not to say that parliament cannot recognize in law other relationships of dependency , but in our judgment these should not be confused in law or public policy with marriage defined as the union of a man and a woman or the familial relations based on that union . 
some might argue on the basis of the supreme court ' s recent M. v H . decision that the court is headed , whether we like it or not , in the direction of saying that in Canadian law a couple is a couple is a couple , regardless of the basis of the relationship . 
however I believe I speak for the majority of parliamentarians , not just Reformers , when I say that it is parliament ' s intention , that it was parliament ' s intention and that it is still parliament ' s intention that the union of a man and a woman , which is unique in its potential for the natural procreation and nurturing of children , should be in a category by itself as should be the familial relations based upon it . 
on page 22 the throne speech states that Canada will champion efforts at the United Nations to eliminate the exploitation of children . 
if this is the case , the government should then direct the courts here at home to stop protecting the consumers of child pornography . 
when parliament passed that section of the criminal code , and that debate has gone before the B.C. court , it intended that the possession of child pornography should be treated as a crime . 
why ? 
because possession represents the demand side of the pornography industry . 
if one wants to shut down the pornography industry one has to go after the demand side and not just the supply side . 
if the criminal code does not make it crystal clear that is what parliament intended , the government should introduce legislation that makes that crystal clear to the courts . 
if the courts still insist that section of the criminal code is not charter compatible , the government should not hesitate to use the notwithstanding clause now to enforce such a provision . 
surely if the government values children it will put their right to protection from the evils of pornography ahead of any adult ' s right to possess child pornography . 
the throne speech also expresses particular concern about child poverty while often ignoring the family context in which much of that poverty occurs . 
the government takes in $ 6 billion and tries to figure out how some complicated program , which will cost a lot administratively , will give them back a couple of hundred dollars for this or that . 
it is a deficiency which in our judgment cannot be remedied until there are 150 - plus members in the House who are convinced in their hearts as well as their heads that the number one social priority of government should be the protection and nurturing of the family . 
i have three examples . 
there is the impact of the Singh decision on the government ' s ability to halt people smuggling . 
what difference does it make if this parliament sets up the ideal system for handling immigrants and refugees ? 
as long as the Singh decision stands , there are legal ways around it . 
it can be fought every step of the way for seven years . 
there is the impact of the B.C. court decision in the Sharpe case which legitimates demand for child pornography . 
it is already having a secondary impact in other parts of the country while we wait and wait for a court decision that may not come . 
there is the impact of the Marshall decision on the management of the east coast fishery . 
i understand we will have a debate tonight during which we can get into this in detail . 
the member for Delta - South Richmond will be saying a lot on this a little later . 
in the Marshall case the court affirmed an aboriginal fishing right from a treaty that does not contain the word fish . 
talk about writing things in , that is a good example . 
apparently no one , and this is the responsibility of the government and not the court , made a convincing case for the dangers of having one law for aboriginals and another law for non - aboriginal fishermen . 
the court made a fishery policy as distinct from parliament making a fishery policy leading to , in this case , violence and chaos on the east coast fishery . 
switching to the positive , the official opposition has a vision of the proper relationship between parliament , the court and the executive . 
it is a vision that is rooted in our own Constitution and several hundred years of British constitutional convention and precedents . 
it is based on a simple principle , that parliament makes the law , the administration administers the law and the court interprets the law . 
the root of the problem is that the BNA Act of 1867 founded Canada on a constitution " similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom '' . 
one of the founding principles is that parliament makes the law , the executive implements the law and the courts interpret it . 
this law included for the first time in Canada a constitutionally entrenched guarantee of civil rights . 
it served the same function in Canada as the U.S. bill of rights but without any of the checks and balances on the three branches of government which are found in the American Constitution . 
that is what happens when you transplant an idea from one constitutional system to another . 
you do not necessarily bring along with it the checks and balances that made it work in the original situation . 
with the introduction of the charter to the Canadian Constitution a great departure began from the historic division of responsibilities between parliament and the courts which continues to this very day . 
the consequences of that departure include replacement of the supremacy of parliament with the supremacy of the Constitution as interpreted by judges . 
they include a transfer of power from parliament and the legislatures to the courts , including a transfer of the ultimate right of interpretation . 
the other consequence is the thrusting , whether they want it or not , of unelected judges with no direct accountability to the people into the realm of decision making and political activism . 
the consequences of this great departure and the political activism of the courts are enormous . 
the Mah é decision of 1990 took the courts into the operation of school boards . 
the Eldridge decision of 1993 took the court into affecting provincial government budgetary decisions . 
the Singh case of 1985 , as already pointed out , took the court into the administration of immigration and refugee procedures . 
the Therens case of 1985 created an enhanced role for lawyers in criminal proceedings that went far too far and which has had negative effects . 
we saw further evidence of political and social activism by the courts when they created the defence of self - induced intoxication , something parliament never ever dreamed about in any of its wildest moments . 
that was via the Daviault case in 1994 . 
there was court direction of public policy with respect to vagrancy via the Heywood case of 1994 . There was the extension of the requirement for the use of warrants to unreasonable lengths via the Feeney case of 1997 . 
at such time it would be my intention to lay before parliament a number of measures for clearly delineating a line between ourselves and the courts . 
these measures include a number of things , of which I will mention three . 
first would be measures to ensure that parliament specifies in each statute it passes the intent of that statute and that it obtains independent legal advice , because we cannot get it from the justice department , on the charter compatibility of bills before they leave this place rather than after . 
it is a process of pre - legislative review . 
we would also recommend that these remedial measures include the establishment of a judicial review committee of parliament to prepare an appropriate parliamentary response to those court decisions that misconstrue parliament ' s intent , and include recommendations of the appropriate use of the notwithstanding clause which I remind hon. members is just as much a part of our Constitution as is the charter of rights and freedoms . 
when we look at the Speech from the Throne we do not see any recognition of this even though it affects everything we pass here . 
why is that ? 
i suspect it is because on many of the issues affected by the political activism of the courts , especially in moral and social areas , the Liberal administration would prefer to have the hard decisions made by Liberal appointed judges rather than by the elected members . 
if that is the case , we will not see a remedy to this problem until there are 150 - plus members elected to this Chamber with a commitment to change and to draw the line crystal clear between parliament and the courts . 
as all members here know , Canada is the second largest nation in terms of territory on the face of the earth . 
it consists of ten provinces and three territories encompassing an enormous breadth of cultural and regional diversity . 
in order to unify this great diversity into one nation from sea to sea to sea , our forefathers rightly chose to apply the principles of federalism . 
canada is therefore a federal state , but because of its size and diversity it is a federal state that cannot take its internal unity for granted even for a month . 
let us look at the present state of our federal union and the Speech from the Throne from this perspective . 
this summer my wife and I spent several weeks in the west , two weeks in Quebec , two weeks in Ontario , and almost three weeks in Atlantic Canada . 
we attended some 80 different functions , many of them informal social functions which gave us a good opportunity to interact with people . 
we listened to the predictable concerns of people about taxes , jobs and health care . 
but we also perceived something else , something less defined and yet very real and something that is bigger than people ' s day to day concerns . 
there are four big regional concerns and aspirations which I believe are abroad in our land and which this federal parliament must recognize and address in order to maintain the unity and progress of this country in the 21 st century . 
let me begin in the west . 
i like beginning in the west . 
in June , Sandra and I travelled to the Milk River country of southern Alberta . 
there we borrowed two horses and a tent from a longtime rancher in the Milk River area , Tom Gilchrist . 
for three days we joined the anniversary trail ride commemorating the 1874 march west of the original North West Mounted Police contingent ; a great adventure which originally took 275 officers and men from Fort Dufferin south of Winnipeg all through the southern part of Saskatchewan and southern Alberta to Fort Whoop - Up 125 years before . 
that original group of North West Mounted Police included Colonel James MacLeod who would lay the foundation for a treaty with the great Blackfoot confederacy on the basis of a simple principle : equality under the law . 
i wish James MacLeod had been around when they were putting together the Nisga ' a treaty . 
that is how he made peace with the fiercest group of aboriginals left on the prairies . 
it was the last group to have a confrontation with the Europeans . 
he made it on a simple basis . 
a couple of RCMP walked into a huge camp . 
there was one law , the same law , for whites and Indians . 
he did a few things to back it up and that was the basis of that peace . 
he became the greatest premier the old North - West Territories ever had . 
he was the one who negotiated the provincial terms of entry of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the federal union as provinces . 
what was the principle he insisted on , even though he did not get it ? 
equality for provinces . 
equality between the new provinces and the old provinces . 
members of that same old Northwest Mounted Police contingent would soon establish another fort at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers , Fort Calgary , the place where over a century later nine premiers and two territorial leaders would meet and produce a declaration asserting the principle of equality of all Canadians and provinces under the law and that any power given to one province to protect and develop its uniqueness would be given to the others . 
equality for individuals and provinces was as much a founding principle of the old west as accommodation to the French - English fact was a founding principle of central Canada . 
that old west , including British Columbia , was wild and vast with enormous potential . 
it attracted people of enterprise and initiative who overcame all sorts of obstacles and hardships . 
members should read the story of the original march west by the RCMP if they want a story of overcoming hardship . 
that old west had all sorts of new ideas and convictions on how the west itself should be governed . 
but politically the old west had one huge problem . 
it was politically impotent . 
at the turn of the last century the west produced less than 10 % of the GNP , had less than 10 % of the population and had less than 10 % of the seats in this parliament . 
the old west lacked political clout to impress its concerns on the federal government , let alone impress its ideas . 
it quickly and unfortunately developed an underdog attitude that if it participated in negotiations with the national government or if it participated in political dialogue with people in other parts of the country it would rarely win the debate and would always be outvoted and outnumbered . 
what struck me as I rode through that country commemorating the opening up of the old west was how far the west has come in a century and how different the position of the new west entering the 21 st century is in comparison to what the old west was at the turn of the century . 
in that Milk River country , if one stands at the right place , the Cypress Hills can be seen to the east , the Sweet Grass Hills of Montana to the south and Chief Mountain to the west . 
these were all sacred places to the Blackfoot . 
they were high places from which the Blackfoot believed they could see forever and from which they believed they could see the future . 
it was a place where the young saw visions and the old dreamed dreams . 
could any of the people who mounted those heights at the turn of the last century , aboriginal or non - aboriginal , possibly have envisioned the new west of the 21 st century ? 
the new west is no longer politically impotent . 
in the 21 st century it will be impossible to implement any truly national policy without the west ' s concurrence or to form any truly national government without western participation . 
the great challenge for westerners is how to use this newfound influence . 
there will be some , " little westerners " Haultain would have called them , who will advocate that the new west should use its growing influence simply to settle old scores and that the west should confine itself to addressing its own immediate regional interests . 
these people will prefer regional parties over national parties . 
there will even be some who will say , regrettably , that the new west should use its influence to separate from Canada . 
fortunately there will be others , " big westerners " Haultain would call them , who will advocate a much more positive and inclusive course . 
reform is the principle and Reform is the voice of the new west . 
we say yes , the new west should use its influence to protect and advance regional interests , to raise the agricultural concerns of the prairies higher on the national agenda , to protect the oil and gas producing regions from another raid by the federal government , to prevent the west coast fishery from suffering the same abuse as the east coast fishery and to make B.C. Canada ' s gateway to the Asia - Pacific . 
we also say that the new west should use its new influence in the federation to address and resolve the problems of the federation as a whole , to get the federal financial house in order by insisting that tax and debt levels be lowered for all Canadians , by advocating that national health care - medicare , after all , was born in the west - be reformed for the benefit of all Canadians , by insisting that federal institutions be made more representative and democratically accountable for all Canadians , and by insisting that the equality of all Canadians and all provinces under the law become a governing constitutional principle throughout the entire country and be pounded into the heads of members of parliament . 
when we look at the Speech from the Throne from this perspective , what do we see ? 
we see no evidence at all that the federal government even recognizes the existence or emergence of the new west , let alone a preparedness to accommodate its aspirations . 
the federal government is at odds , in particular with British Columbia , on everything from the mismanagement of immigration and refugees to the mismanagement of the fishery to the mismanagement of aboriginal relations . 
it has negotiated a treaty with the Nisga ' a which is based not on the principle of equality of all under the law , but on the divisive principle of one law for aboriginals and another for non - aboriginals . 
rather than offering tax incentives to reduce greenhouse emissions , the government has mused about imposing a green tax which would discriminate against the petroleum producing regions without proposing any compensatory measures or equivalent environmental taxes on competing energy sources . 
by failing to propose or mount a concerted international attack on European agricultural subsidies , it refuses to get at the root of the low commodity prices that are doing enormous damage to our farmers . 
the Prime Minister has never followed up on that resolution we passed in the House one night , which members voted for , calling on the federal government to help communicate the real significance of the Calgary declaration to Quebec . 
the Speech from the Throne and the Liberal government are completely oblivious to the spirit and the aspirations of the new west . 
this is a deficiency which is inexcusable in a federal system where the federal government must recognize regional aspirations and respond to them for the sake and well - being of Canadians living in those regions , as well as national unity . 
i said there were four strong winds . 
the wind coming out of the new west is only one . 
in Ontario , the federal government must recognize and accommodate the aspirations of the common sense revolution . 
it has not done so and there is little in the Speech from the Throne that indicates it is prepared to do so . 
in 1993 the people of Ontario elected the tax cutting , common sense government of Premier Harris to get that province ' s financial house in order . 
premier Harris proceeded to do so by cutting taxes 30 % , introducing programs like workfare as preferable to welfare , while still spending 50 % more dollars on health care in that one province than this government spends on health care in the entire country . 
in 1997 Mr. Harris asked the people of Ontario whether they wanted his government to continue on this common sense course and , in particular , whether they wanted him to continue to cut taxes . 
despite the fierce opposition of both federal and provincial Liberals , the Harris government was returned by the people of Ontario with a solid majority . 
we offer them our heartiest congratulations . 
there is a strong wind blowing across Ontario . 
it is the wind of the common sense revolution . 
it is completely counterproductive for the largest government in the country , the federal government , to pursue tax policies that are at cross purposes with the tax policies of the largest provincial government . 
people in Ontario are concerned , like people in Alberta , that tax and spend federal Liberals will move into the hard earned vacated tax room created by the provincial government . 
they want the principles of the common sense revolution to be respected and implemented in Ottawa as well as Queen ' s Park . 
yet , there is not a flicker of recognition in the Speech from the Throne of that political reality . 
it fails to recognize , let alone respect , the principal fiscal interest of the largest province in Canada . 
i talked about four strong winds . 
i have two so far . 
there is an easterly wind beginning to blow in this country . 
the Atlantic provinces are bestirring themselves in a manner which is good for them and good for the country . 
some of these policies , and they represent a departure from what the federal government has done , were first proposed and pursued by Premier McKenna of New Brunswick , who has just denounced the federal Liberals ' approach to regional economic development in the strongest possible terms . 
according to a Globe and Mail report , Mr. McKenna has unleashed a scorching indictment of the federal government ' s treatment of Atlantic Canada . 
the federal Liberals , he said , have nothing in the window for his region . 
he speaks of " their total ignorance of the issues of shipbuilding , their total ignorance of the very highly developed information technology sector which is taking place here , their disgraceful management of the fisheries issue and the resource issue having to do with the natives '' . 
all of these things , he said , are just more nails in their coffin . 
premier McKenna ' s initiatives were largely abandoned by his successor at the provincial level , who paid the price at the polls . 
in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia two tired and discredited Liberal administrations have been turned out of office and replaced by the Conservative ministries of Mr. Lord and Dr. Hamm . 
in both elections the smell of patronage and federal political interference in provincial highway projects was a factor in the defeat of the provincial Liberal administrations , and both of these administrations are seeking to pursue new approaches to economic growth . 
we extend our heartiest congratulations to both . 
the winds of change are blowing in Atlantic Canada . 
yet , when we examine the Speech from the Throne , supposedly the speech laying out the legislative program of the federal government which claims it lies awake nights trying to figure out how to make this federation work better , there is no recognition of this regional fact at all , no new principles or visions that respond to the new wind that is blowing out of Atlantic Canada . 
that brings me to the fourth wind . 
the fourth wind that a perceptive and sensitive federal government would be recognizing and seeking to accommodate would be the new wind that is stirring in Quebec . 
it is still a light breeze , but there are signs in the polls and the political discussion in that province that perhaps up to 15 % of the Quebec electorate is open to a third way , une troisi è me voie : not separation for Canada , not the status quo federalism of the Liberals and the Prime Minister , but reform of the federation with a rebalancing of the powers between the federal and provincial governments for the 21 st century , a rebalancing that would strengthen the federal government in some of its key areas of jurisdiction , strengthen the provinces in some of their key areas of jurisdiction , particularly health , education and social assistance , and include jurisdiction for the provinces over language and culture . 
yet , when we examine the Speech from the Throne and the application of the principles of federalism to the maintenance of national unity , what do we see ? 
as I have said , we see nothing that truly recognizes the growing and diverse regional aspirations of the west , Ontario or Atlantic Canada . 
when it comes to addressing the concerns of Quebec we see nothing of the principle or the vision of a reformed federalism , only a continuation of the status quo plus a veiled reference to defining a federal position on the secession process and question . 
i find it absolutely amazing that a government that prides itself on always taking the balanced approach - how many times have we heard it , always seeking the balanced approach between spending and tax cuts , between debt reduction and taxation - when it comes to national unity it takes a totally unbalanced approach . 
when it comes to national unity and adjusting federalism to accommodate the strains of regional - provincial interests , the government spends 90 % of its time thinking about Quebec and 10 % of its time thinking about the rest of the country . 
when it comes to Quebec , the government spends 90 % of the time trying to defend and perpetuate an unacceptable status quo . 
when it comes to advocating something new to provide a way out of the constitutional box for either discontented federalists or for weary nationalists in Quebec , instead of presenting both plan A and plan B in balance so Quebecers understand all their options and the consequences of them , the Speech from the Throne contains no plan A and only a veiled reference to a plan B proposal for federal legislation on the secession referendum process and question . 
the Prime Minister must come across in Quebec as the schoolyard bully . 
when the sovereignists show strength , as in the last referendum , he grovels and promises anything , like constitutional recognition of distinct society which he had opposed for 36 years . 
however , when he thinks his opponents are weakening , he plays the tough guy who is willing to go to court . 
on the question of national unity , Quebecers are used to seeing the Prime Minister playing the blow - hard . 
that has been his style throughout his political career . 
the Prime Minister is brave when his adversaries are disorganized , but he makes himself scarce as soon as they begin to rally round . 
if federalists are going to speak credibly to Quebecers we must be consistent and balanced . 
we should recognize that status quo federalism has little appeal in particular to the young . 
we should not risk a revival of support for separation as a reaction to clumsy miscalculations by status quo federalists . 
if plan A and plan B are to be presented they must be presented in balance , with plan A representing reform of the federation with the priority being given to communicating it to those who are searching for a third way . 
those are the four big winds that we see blowing across the country . 
we see nothing in the Speech from the Throne that shows any recognition of them whatsoever , that shows any preparedness to harness them for the benefit of the country in the 21 st century and no adjustment of federalism beyond the status quo . 
in our judgment , this deficiency will not be remedied until there are 150 - plus members of parliament from all parts of the country committed to that vision of a reformed federation for the 21 st century . 
one might ask why there is so much public interest and support throughout the country for things like tax relief , criminal justice reform , the strengthening of families , health care reform and the reform of federal - provincial relations to make them more co - operative and productive , and yet so little principled commitment or action on these fronts in the legislative program of the federal government . 
the answer lies in the fact that the federal political institutions of the country , in particular this parliament and this House of Commons , are defective in terms of their capacity to accurately assess and represent the public will and to respond democratically to public demands . 
this is why Reformers want not simply to reform particular fiscal , social , economic or justice policies of the government . 
we want to reform the system itself whereby these policies are developed and implemented in the first place . 
we have a vision of a country and a system of government that is truly democratic , not simply democratic in appearance , not an autocracy where people get a chance to vote for the autocrat every four years , but a genuine democracy where the institutions are truly representative and accountable and where the first allegiance of members of parliament is not to their party or to themselves but to the people who elect them . 
we envision a parliament where the upper house is a credit and a complement to democracy , not the disgrace to democracy that it is now . 
we envision a Senate that is democratically elected with equal numbers per province and effective powers to safeguard and represent regional interests . 
if the country had a workable Senate , in particular the way the Fathers of Confederation envisioned it to be , the first place where these four regional winds that are blowing would register in Parliament is the Senate . 
as it is , it is the last place . 
they could have a hurricane over there and they would not even recognize it as a wind . 
we envision a parliament where there is genuine free voting in both the Houses , not just on private members ' bills or on exceptional occasions when the government does not want to touch a moral issue with a 10 - foot pole , but every day on issues of substance and on government bills and opposition motions of every description . 
if a government motion is defeated or an opposition motion is carried the government will not resign . 
it will respect that vote and only resign in response to the passage of an explicit vote of no confidence '' . 
can hon. members imagine even for a moment what a difference that one simple change would make to improve the democratic nature of this place ? 
the capacity of every single member to more effectively represent constituents ' interests would be increased , in particular when the constituents ' will conflicts with the party line . 
they could initiate legislation . 
debates would no longer be meaningless , sequential soliloquies because members would actually be free to change their mind or their positions as a result of something that some other member had said . 
legislation would be enacted perhaps not in exactly the same form that it was originally introduced by the government , but enacted nevertheless by majority vote and in accordance with a broader cross - section of public and national opinion than would otherwise be the case . 
in other words , we envision a democratic parliamentary system where the principles of genuine democracy , of effective representation , of true accountability , of free votes and of public participation are actually practised and reflected in the day to day operations of our institution . 
they marked their ballots in the spirit of democracy . 
perhaps the most encouraging thing for Canadian democrats this summer was a conference held at Bird ' s Hill Provincial Park in Manitoba by the First Nations Accountability Coalition , a group now representing grassroots aboriginal people from more than 200 first nations communities across the country . 
what were they talking about ? 
they were talking about fiscal and democratic accountability for on - reserve governments and the department of Indian affairs . 
not a flicker of enthusiasm for any of the great democratic principles and reforms that would make the country a model democracy for the 21 st century . 
they sit in the balcony expecting to see a model democracy . 
i have devoted almost the entirety of my reply to the Speech from the Throne to demonstrating its greatest flaws : its deficiency in principle and vision . 
this brings me to my final point . 
the official opposition is deeply committed to these principles . 
for example , across the country there are hundreds and thousands of supporters and voters for various political parties who believe in the principle of fiscal responsibility , in particular the need for national tax and debt reduction . 
however , because so many of the people who hold these convictions are divided in their political loyalties between various political parties , between several federal parties , or between provincial parties that espouse these principles and federal parties of the same name that do not , it has not been possible to amass the political support required to elect the 150 - plus members needed in this parliament to make real tax reduction and tax relief a reality . 
across the country there are millions of people who would agree in principle that Canada needs to make a new commitment to law and order , to preserving the family and to reforming federal - provincial relations . 
however , again , because the political loyalties of those people are divided among various political groups , the country ends up being governed by a party that is committed to none of these principles and elected with only 38 % of the vote . 
it could be argued that if only we could secure some of these democratic reforms I have enumerated , in particular free voting in the House or some change in the electoral system , it would then be much more possible to form temporary or permanent coalitions of members of the House who are committed to the same principles but find themselves currently divided by party lines and loyalties . 
there is a catch - 22 to that argument . 
in order to implement those democratic reforms , we need the 150 - plus votes required to carry a motion or a bill and no such free voting or committed majority exists in this Chamber at the present time . 
what is this telling us ? 
what is this telling Canadians ? 
it is telling us that there is a need for a realignment of the party lines in the country in order to implement policies based on widely shared principles and values be they those that I have enumerated or some other set of principles that others may define . 
it is to advance the principle of political realignment , the principle that party lines and party structures must be adjusted from time to time to better unite rather than further divide all those who share certain common principles essential to the implementation of public policy conducive to good government , that the official opposition has offered to work with others like - minded , regardless of past party affiliation , to create a principled united alternative to the current administration in time for the next election . 
in this partisan House , I am well aware that arguments in favour of co - operation across party lines for the sake of the country usually fall on deaf ears . 
however , out in the real world where voters and taxpayers live this is not the case . 
i believe that increasing numbers of Canadians are watching us with two questions in mind whether or not we as practising politicians want to recognize it . 
they are watching first to see whether any existing party is willing to make a sincere effort to define new common ground on which large numbers of Canadians could unite in new ways to lower taxes , to heal the health care , to democratize their institutions and to unite our country , all the things the status quo Liberal administration has been unable to provide . 
second , they are watching to see if any existing party is so committed to these principles that it is prepared to set aside its own partisan goals , even if for a moment , and work with others who are like minded , regardless of past party affiliation , in order to implement those principles at the federal level . 
two weekends ago the once great Progressive Conservative Party of Canada said no to both the idea of seeking new common ground and setting aside its own narrow partisan goals to work with others . 
it will have to live with the consequences of that decision , the kind of inward looking thinking that reduced its representation from 169 seats in the 34 th Parliament to 2 seats in the 35 th Parliament , that has reduced its party membership from 90,000 a year ago to 18,000 under the current leadership , at least half of whom reject the traditional conservative principles of both fiscal conservatism and free trade . 
the Reform Party of Canada and the official opposition in this Chamber has said yes to both those questions . 
over the next few months it will continue to explore whether it is possible to build a new principled alternative to the unprincipled and visionless administration in time for a new century . 
the original Fathers of Confederation had a dream . 
we should remember this because a similar challenge was faced by a parliament long ago that created our country . 
the original Fathers of Confederation had a dream that could not be realized until there was a political realignment in the old parliament of Canada . 
i too have a dream of a new and better Canada that requires a political realignment if it is to be fulfilled early in the new millennium . 
it has sometimes been asked how was it that the original Fathers of Confederation , a group which contained people who wanted to conserve certain old things like the French language and culture and the British connection and which contained people with radical new ideas on federalism and advanced democracy , were able or willing to work together to bring into being the new confederation . 
the short answer which has meaning for us today is that the conservers of the old and the advocates of the new learned to bear with one another and to recognize each in the other the necessary complement of their one - sidedness . 
the defenders of the old need the challenge of new ideas . 
if they do not have that the old ossifies and eventually decays . 
the advocates of change need the influence of the advocates of old principles to constrain them from going too far . 
if the two can ever bear with one another , one of the products of their doing that at the turn of the last century was the country of Canada itself . 
i invite all Canadians who share in their hearts a vision of a better Canada where taxes are lower and government less intrusive ; where law and order and the value of the family are enhanced rather than undermined by federal policy ; where federal and provincial governments co - operate rather than bicker in a better federal union to provide better health , education and social services for our people ; and where federal political institutions like the Senate and the House command a new respect because of their effectiveness and commitment to democratic accountability to work together . 
i invite all who share in this vision and the principles on which it rests to work together to remedy the deficiencies in principle and vision that characterize this last gasp throne speech from a tired and visionless administration . 
in the meantime I move that the following words be added to the address : 
and that this House regrets that your Government has failed through a lack of vision and commitment to sound principles to adequately address the allegations of corruption against it , including the abuse of patronage ; failed to bring integrity to Canada ' s immigration system by allowing organized crime to take advantage of Canadians ' generosity and by undermining the standing of legitimate immigrants and genuine refugees ; failed to seriously deal with the problems of drug trafficking , youth crime , and child pornography ; rejected the common sense policies of other governments , most notably the Ontario and Alberta Governments , of lowering taxes to create jobs and prevent companies , young people , and capital from leaving the country ; failed to maintain the supremacy of Parliament in relation to the court ; failed to recognize the serious plight of Canadian agriculture and to provide a framework for reorganizing the airline industry ; failed to provide for the democratic reform of federal institutions and the reform of federal - provincial relations through the rebalancing of powers ; and therefore , having failed to demonstrate the capacity , commitment , and vision required to lead this country into the 21 st century , has lost the confidence of this House and the Canadian people . 
the Speaker : 
the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is in order . 
debate is on the amendment . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I begin my remarks today by congratulating the hon. member for Windsor - St. 
Clair on the excellent speech he made in moving the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
i would also like to congratulate the member for Laval West , who also made an excellent presentation in seconding the address yesterday . 
i was very impressed by their presentations and I am sure that they will have a fine career here in the Parliament of Canada . 
on behalf of all members of the House I congratulate Her Excellency on assuming her functions as governor general . 
we all wish her well . 
today we are on the eve of what many predict will be the century of the Pacific . 
one hundred years ago who would have predicted that a woman immigrant from China would one day become Governor General of Canada ? 
it is with great pride that I say we have come a long , long way in this wonderful country . 
we are now 75 days from the turn of a new century . 
it has been said that Canada is a triumph of will over geography and economics , and what a triumph it has been . 
how easy it would have been for a small population , spread over vast spaces across the entire continent , to succumb to the forces of manifest destiny . 
but succumb we did not . 
we grew and we flourished . 
how easy it would have been for a small French speaking population , concentrated on the banks of the St. Lawrence , to succumb to the forces of the English speaking North American melting pot . 
but succumb we did not . 
we grew and we flourished . 
how easy it would have been for our first citizens , the aboriginal people , to succumb to the forces of assimilation . 
but succumb they did not , and a new relationship is growing and flourishing . 
in a century of tyranny Canadians gave their lives in the far corners of the world so that others could live in freedom . 
today I would like to pay tribute to the troops who are all over the world at this moment working for peace . 
in a century of intolerance Canada became a beacon of freedom . 
in a century of brutal dictatorships Canada became an advanced pluralistic democracy . 
in a century of the worst excesses of nationalism Canada became a multicultural post - national society . 
in a century of human rights oppression Canada embraced a charter of rights and freedoms . 
in a century of growing gaps between the haves and have nots Canada developed an advanced system of social security and a social safety net . 
in a century of great economic progress , from the small agrarian society that it was , Canada has become one of the seven great industrialized countries . 
in a century of entrepreneurship and innovation , Canada has been at the forefront . 
we Canadians have proven to be a very determined people . 
it is a balance that promotes individual freedom and economic prosperity while , at the same time , sharing risks and benefits . 
the world has sat up and noticed . 
the world values what we have accomplished . 
it wants us to succeed . 
and succeed we have , and succeed we will . 
we will build on our strengths . 
we will take bold action for the future . 
the Canadian way will be a model , setting standards for the whole world . 
we all know that there are some in Canada who will judge the success of countries solely by how much money they can make . 
ironically , many of those who today judge us harshly on our economic policy have actually made a great deal of money in Canada . 
that is certainly not the only criterion for judging success , nor should it be the only criterion for governing . 
life is about more than just making money . 
there may be other countries that are better for those who are already very well off . 
i am not sure , but there may be . 
however , if I have to choose between decisions that make life better for those in the middle and for those who have less or decisions for those who already have a great deal , I know how I choose . 
i know how this government chooses and I know how Canadians choose . 
we choose the Canadian way . 
we have every reason to be very proud of what we have accomplished . 
we have every reason to be full of hope , of confidence and optimism for the future . 
that does not mean that everything in Canada is as it should be for everyone . It is not . 
that does not mean that everything is as it can be and must be for everyone . It is not . 
there is a lot of room for rolling up our sleeves , looking forward and working harder together . 
we have much work left to do , not only for this parliament but for the next parliament as well . 
with an appreciation for our past , boldness of vision and the courage to act , we can take what is clearly the best country in the world in which to live and make it better for everyone . 
our vision of the Canada of the 21 st century is clear : a society of excellence with a commitment to success , a strong and united country , a dynamic economy , a creative and innovative population , a diverse and cohesive society where prosperity is not limited to the few , but is shared by many . 
it is a Canada where every child gets the right start in life , where young people have a chance to grow and be the best at whatever they want to do , where citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to excel . 
it is a Canada where citizens , regardless of income , receive quality health services , where families enjoy safe communities and a clean environment and where we work together with other countries to promote peace , cultural diversity and the human purpose and benefits of the new global economy . 
it is a country , Canada , that is the place to be in the 21 st century , the place where people want to come and stay , to learn , to pursue opportunities , to raise children , to enjoy natural beauty , to open new frontiers and to set the standard for the world for a high quality of life . 
it is a Canada that is a leader and an example to the world . 
we must set ambitious , concrete objectives , and work with Canadians to achieve them . 
that is what leadership is really about . 
that is why the government is setting out both five - year objectives and concrete steps over the next two years to achieve them . 
above all , a strong economy is the indispensable foundation for all we can do and all we want to do . 
the government ' s economic strategy is clear and comprehensive ; it is to make Canada a world leader in the next century . 
when we took office six years ago , we had a plan . 
and we will continue to follow it . 
we are now in a position to build on it by setting ambitious new goals and objectives for the next five years . 
we have to build a common vision of how Canada will take on the world , and win , in the 21 st century . 
we have to think globally . 
we have to brand Canada , at home and abroad , as a dynamic and skilled knowledge - based economy . 
and we must do these things faster than our global competitors , because speed wins . 
but to compete on an equal footing , we first had to restore the country ' s fiscal health . 
the era of growing debt and large deficits is now behind us once and for all . 
in each and every year , instead of adding to the national debt , we will pay it down . 
the debt to GDP ratio will decrease year after year , after year . 
the economy is growing strongly and sustainably . 
Canadians are more optimistic about the economy and their individual prospects today than they have been for a long , long time . 
i want to express to him my personal gratitude as Prime Minister , the gratitude of his colleagues in caucus and cabinet , and that of all Canadians . 
with the fiscal house in order , with the strong and growing economy , we can move forward boldly to implement our economic strategy , to strengthen the economic and social fabric of Canada and to seize the opportunities of a new century . 
the government , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Finance and the Liberal Party have been and are committed to reducing taxes as the finance of the nation improves . 
we have already started and we will carry on . 
but lower taxes are not an end in themselves . 
they are an essential part of an economic strategy to provide jobs , growth , rising incomes and a higher quality of life . 
we began targeted tax relief even before the budget was balanced . 
as soon as the books were balanced the Minister of Finance introduced broad based tax relief . 
the budgets of 1998 and 1999 have together cut taxes by $ 16.5 billion over a three year period . 
now we will do more in a responsible and sustained way , year after year after year . 
with continuing improvements in the financial health of the nation we will do more to reduce taxes in the years ahead . 
in the next budget the Minister of Finance will outline a multi - year tax reduction strategy to ensure that Canadian families have more income in their pockets than they had when we started as government , and that Canadian businesses are better able to compete in the global knowledge based economy . 
tax reduction is only one part of the equation . 
a comprehensive , balanced economic strategy requires investment , public and private , in children , knowledge , creativity , innovation , health and the environment . 
it also requires maintaining flexibility to meet urgent needs such as the problems in agriculture today in western Canada . 
i hope people will note that . 
this government committed itself at the beginning of this mandate to using 50 % of any surplus for tax and debt reduction and the other 50 % for investment in economic and social needs that will increase our quality of life over the long term . 
there is a growing Canadian consensus that this is the right approach , that this balanced approach is the Canadian way . 
in August in Quebec City we saw agreement on that from Tory premiers from the west and from Atlantic Canada . 
the NDP governments were there as were Mike Harris and Lucien Bouchard . 
in fact , Premier Harris read from the red book . 
he saw that as real common sense and that is why he approved of it . 
i do not blame him . 
i applaud him . 
he has to like it . 
our comprehensive strategy to make Canada the place to be in the 21 st century means focusing on children , on knowledge , on youth , on health and on the environment . 
the best place to start is with Canada ' s children . 
if we want the brightest future possible for our country , we must ensure that all our children have the best possible start in life . 
real support for Canadian families in the Canadian way . 
let me elaborate on three aspects of our strategy . 
there is now overwhelming scientific evidence that success in a child ' s early years is the key to long term healthy development . 
nothing is more important than for parents to be able to spend the maximum amount of time with newborn children in the critical early months of a child ' s life . 
therefore , I am proud to announce today that the government will introduce legislation in this parliament to extend employment insurance maternity and parental benefits from the current maximum of six months to one full year . 
we will make these benefits more flexible to meet the different needs of families . 
we will make them more accessible by increasing the number of parents eligible for support . 
together with the provinces , we have begun to put in place the national children ' s agenda to improve supports for families and children . 
i believe this work has to be accelerated . 
provincial premiers think so as well and discussed this last summer . 
we must move as quickly as possible from talk to action . 
we have demonstrated over the last three years that federal and provincial governments can work together to help families with children . 
the national child benefit is an outstanding example of federal - provincial collaboration . 
we must now continue toward our goal that parents will no longer have to choose between a job and benefits for their children . 
too often , we have seen people turn down jobs because they might lose their government benefits . 
under the system we have introduced , in collaboration with provincial governments , people are motivated to keep their job because they are not penalized for working , as they were in the past . 
we will therefore - and this is very important - make a third significant investment in the national child benefit for low income families with children , to be in place no later than July 1 , 2001 . 
and we will seek a commitment from the provinces , who have all asked for this further federal contribution , to build on our investment by increasing their own investments in early childhood development . 
in a country as prosperous as ours , senior Canadians should not be denied the security and dignity of an income . 
we did not build our system of old age security and public pensions overnight . 
but we focused on our goal and , by and large , we succeeded . 
what kind of world will these children live in ? 
well , we can see it already . 
and we can also see how they will succeed . 
we enter a new century at a time of rapid change , the scope and speed of which the world has never seen . 
it was a Canadian , Marshall McCluhan , who coined the phrase " global village '' . 
our researchers no longer compete with each other ; they are in competition every day with the whole world . 
our industries no longer compete locally ; they compete globally . 
globalization and technology have redefined the concept of the marketplace . 
this has a major implication for public policy . 
to seize the opportunities of the new knowledge based economy requires a comprehensive and ambitious strategy . 
we have begun this in the last six years . 
our goal is for Canada to be known around the world as the place to be , the place of exciting opportunities . 
the knowledge based industries which will provide the jobs of the future require access to a diverse range of skills close at hand to support them . 
this is much easier for a large country like the United States to achieve than it is for a relatively small country like Canada . 
over the years through the granting councils , the Medical Research Council , the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council , the Government of Canada has been far and away the largest contributor to university research in our country . 
in recent years the granting councils have contributed to the pursuit of excellence by creating and supporting hundreds of research chairs in our universities . 
they are now prepared to build on what they have already begun . 
the heads of the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for Innovation , working with some university presidents , in particular Dr. Robert Lacroix , the rector of the Universit é de Montr é al , and Dr. Martha Piper , the president of UBC , have come to the government with an exciting and ambitious proposal . 
they want to build on existing partnerships between our universities , the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for Innovation , to brand Canada around the world as the place to be for knowledge creation as we enter the 21 st century , to enable Canadian universities to create outstanding research opportunities for the best and brightest Canadians . 
it is a plan for brain gain , not brain drain . 
they have proposed a plan to establish over the next three years 1,200 new 21 st century chairs for research excellence in universities across Canada . 
they want to provide enough financial support for the total costs of research for each new research chair to make them internationally competitive and to set as an objective reaching a total of 2,000 new chairs for research excellence across Canada as soon as possible thereafter . 
it is a plan I welcome and we welcome on this side of the House . 
it is a plan for excellence and international competitiveness which the government endorses enthusiastically . 
we will provide the required funding to the granting councils and the Canada Foundation for Innovation . 
this is not all . 
with the Canada millennium scholarship fund , the Canada Foundation for Innovation , the 21 st century chairs for research excellence and the Canadian institutes of health research , the government is putting in place a sweeping and comprehensive strategy for putting Canada in the forefront of the knowledge based economy of the 21 st century . 
getting Canadians connected , to each other , to schools and libraries , to our diverse stories and voices , to government , to the marketplace and to the world , is one of the key elements in establishing Canada as a world leading economy and as a country of opportunity . 
we must aim to be the most connected country in the world , a country which uses these connections in a dynamic and original way . 
our goal is to make Canada a world leader in the smart use of electronic ways of doing business and to encourage the rapid use of e - commerce throughout the economy . 
today , I challenge all sectors of our country , private and public , government and business , to work together toward the goal of capturing 5 % of the world share of e - commerce for Canada by the year 2003 , and to do over $ 200 billion of business in this way . 
by 2004 , our goal is to be the most electronically connected government in the world to its citizens , so that Canadians can access all government information and services on - line at the time and place of their choosing . 
our success in the future will as never before depend on a population committed to learning , adapting to change , at ease with new technologies and the digital economy , and able to master new media . 
our ability to continue to lead in the world demands a commitment to ensuring that young Canadians have opportunities to acquire direct experience in these areas . 
to ensure they have the skills required to use new information technology , we will recruit up to 10,000 young Canadians to train community members of all ages . 
the quality of our lives and the future strength of our society require a new generation of Canadians who have the skills of citizenship and leadership , who understand themselves and their country , and who are open to the world . 
in collaboration with the voluntary sector the government will create a single window service called Exchanges Canada to give 100,000 young Canadians every year the chance to learn about another part of Canada , to live and experience another culture and language . 
to develop projects in the arts , sports , science and community development , the development and maintenance of a strong basic infrastructure as well as a knowledge infrastructure are also key components of a competitive economy for the 21 st century . 
the environment , water and air quality , public health , tourism , transportation , telecommunications and cultural infrastructure must be well planned to meet the needs of a modern economy in urban Canada and in rural Canada . 
it will require partnership , federal , provincial , municipal and the private sector . 
therefore we will seek to reach an agreement with our provincial and municipal partners by no later than the end of next year to begin in 2001 , or before if possible , a five year modern national infrastructure program for Canada . 
in the new global economy a healthy environment and high quality of life go hand in hand . 
this is a matter of very high priority for the government . 
the environment is of importance to all Canadians and particularly to young Canadians . 
our generation will be judged on the environmental legacy we leave to our children and grandchildren . 
legislation will be introduced in this session of parliament to protect species at risk and their critical habitat . 
we will continue to extend Canada ' s national parks system . 
we will clean up contaminated sites in the country and protect the health of Canadians . 
canada enters the next century with enormous advantages . 
in an era of globalization we are a multicultural society whose people have roots in almost every country of the world . 
we are an Atlantic , a Pacific and an Arctic country . 
we belong both to the Commonwealth and to the Francophonie . 
as such we are well placed to promote human security and cultural diversity . 
we have earned a respected place in the world community . 
over the last six years we have taken significant initiatives to help achieve shared international objectives like the land mines treaty and the International Criminal Court . 
we participated very actively at the beginning in the former Yugoslavia , in Bosnia and in Kosovo . 
we took a leadership role in Haiti and now we are in East Timor . 
our objective is to make a difference by using our ingenuity , the history of our international achievements and the respect with which Canada is held in the world to make progress on the human security agenda and to recognize that in a difficult world there will always be more progress to be made . 
we are a very fortunate country . 
we are an affluent country . 
we have an obligation to do our part to help those who are very poor . 
this is our obligation to our fellow human beings . 
the foreign policy through which we project our values , coupled with the trade oriented economy and vigorous promotion of trade and investment interests , will make Canada very well positioned for the global economy of the 21 st century . 
this afternoon I have spoken about the country that we are so proud of , the country that we have built so well in the 20 th century . 
today I have set out a comprehensive strategy for Canadian leadership in the knowledge - based economy and for promoting our interests and projecting our values in the world , a vision for the Canada of the 21 st century and a plan to achieve it , a vision of the Canadian model , a modern project of a society , the project of a forward - looking country . 
these are not old solutions to the problems of today , but new plans to meet new opportunities . 
1745 
it is a strategy for the future for a country of the future , a country that is open to the world and willing to lead . 
Canadians are not a boastful people . 
we are not given to flag waving or emotional excesses . 
in a century , indeed in a millennium , that has seen so much bloodshed over differences of faith , race and nationality , perhaps that is a good thing . 
instead , with quiet confidence we have adopted a Canadian way of living together , resolving differences , reasoning together and creating what is quite simply the best country in the world in which to live . 
i began today by referring to the famous remark of Sir Wilfrid Laurier about the 20 th century belonging to Canada . 
the world has seen the future and it is Canada . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , some weeks ago , the throne speech was being touted as the opportunity for the Prime Minister to demonstrate a vision of Canada for the 21 st century , as we enter a new millennium . 
instead of a vision , we have an invasion . 
for Quebec this throne speech is fraught with meaning and with consequences . 
this prime ministerial vision of the future is one of a Canada that excludes Quebec , that thumbs its nose at Quebec ' s concerns and traditional demands . 
the Prime Minister is now putting into practice his famous statement made just before the last election in Quebec " The general store is now closed '' . 
with this throne speech , the federal government is slamming the door closed on all the commitments toward Quebec that were made leading up to the 1995 referendum . 
there is also a message for all Quebec federalists in this speech : this is the end of renewed federalism , of Quebec ' s traditional demands , this is the end of the concept of founding people , of distinct character , all those formulas that were found in an attempt to renew Canadian federalism . 
from now on everything is clear : one country , one people , one government . 
Mr. Dumont and Mr. Charest have made it clear that they would not have signed it either . 
in the throne speech , the federal government indicated both its intention to work in collaboration with its partners and its intention to do without their approval . 
where exactly does this leave us ? 
the answer is blatantly obvious when we read the Speech from the Throne . 
let me quote an extract from it from page 5 . 
the speech talks of national will , of national strategies and of the partnerships across the country that are required . 
that are required - that is the word , the essence of the Speech from the Throne . 
how will federal government go about achieving this ? 
it tells us that it is going to establish standards of its choosing , since it is omnipotent . 
the government talks about operating on the basis of the social union agreement . 
what does this agreement on social union say ? 
there is discussion , but if no agreement is reached , the federal government - Ottawa knows best - announces three months in advance that it will intervene in areas of provincial jurisdiction where direct services are provided to the public , and the provinces are requested to take note . 
this is what Ottawa calls partnerships . 
in what areas will it impose its standards and set up its programs ? 
national defence or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or air transportation come to mind . 
there is no shortage of problems in these sectors , which are under federal jurisdiction . 
the federal government could ensure pay equity in its own public service or correct the huge injustices caused by the employment insurance reform , which is nothing more than government robbery on the backs of society ' s most disadvantaged . 
in fact , this afternoon the Prime Minister could not deny that , under the social union and the unjustified barriers to mobility , he could take action regarding Bill 101 , regarding the language of work in Quebec . 
this is serious stuff . 
it jeopardizes a vital prerogative in Quebec . 
the Prime Minister also talks about getting involved in Quebec ' s environmental sector , as if his government had lived up to its commitments in its own jurisdictions , including air pollution . 
the government talks about justice . 
it claims that it will reform family law . 
does it intend to tamper with the Civil Code , which is the foundation of the Quebec law and an exclusive Quebec jurisdiction , as was the case even before the Constitution , in 1867 ? 
on page 23 , the government reiterates its intention to impose a repressive act on young offenders , an act that no one in Quebec wants . 
the government is prepared to sacrifice the future of hundreds of young Quebecers to gain a few votes in western Canada . 
this issue does not fall under its jurisdiction . 
the government could have acted through the Criminal Code , it could have taken action against organized crime , which is corrupting our young people and our economic institutions , both in Quebec and across the country , which is going after farmers , and which has even targeted my colleague from Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot . 
it could have tabled anti - gang legislation . 
but there is not one word about the fight against criminals . 
yet , in order to get some votes in western Canada , the government does not hesitate to jeopardize Quebec ' s rehabilitation program for young offenders . 
this is an unacceptable , shameful and cowardly attitude . 
the government also talks about families and young children . 
it now wants to help families and children after having drastically cut employment insurance , health , education and income support . 
the government wants to impose , and I am quoting from page 7 , " common principles , objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments '' . 
this government is so arrogant that it is trying to impose policy by stating that the provinces , and Quebec is in the forefront with its exemplary policies on daycare and early childhood , will be able to provide additional services in their own areas of jurisdiction . 
it takes no little arrogance , indeed a lot of it , to say that the provinces will nevertheless be entitled , in their fields of jurisdiction , to propose policy that is complementary to that decided here in Ottawa . 
in the cultural sector , the federal government mentions Quebec only once . 
we will see later on that it is in order to threaten it . 
otherwise , nothing . 
as if Quebec and Quebec culture did not exist . 
the government has announced a whole series of new cultural programs , but it is also promising an approach that it calls encompassing for national unity . 
that is totally crazy , but I know just how much that inspires the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
the government talks about the environment as well . 
however , this government ' s performance in this area is disastrous . 
it has failed to achieve the very modest objectives it set for itself in Kyoto . 
it refuses to sign the protocol on biodiversity that 140 countries have already signed . 
so much for the federal government ' s jurisdictions . 
what is it doing ? 
well , once again in the provinces ' jurisdictions it will try to impose bills and programs on endangered species and habitats , two areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
this government , from one end of the speech to the other , is ignoring the existence of Quebec and making a mockery of its powers . 
a head - on collision is in the works . 
plan A is not just being ended , it is being buried . 
when I speak of head - on collision , I refer particularly to the area of education . 
naturally , nowhere in the text of the speech does the word education appear . 
i am sure the thesaurus was well used in the writing of this text . 
it probably refers to agriculture when using those terms . 
Ottawa is therefore announcing a national plan related to skills and learning for the 21 st century , with a one - stop entry point , one marked " made in Ottawa '' . 
this means that Ottawa is announcing no more and no less than a national policy for education , a provincial area of jurisdiction if ever there was one , one that has been recognized as exclusive to them since this country began back in 1867 . 
a vision of the future ? 
more of a systematic invasion plan into areas of provincial jurisdiction , with or without the provinces ' consent . 
this means the end of Plan A , but it gives a good idea of what Plan B will or may be , thus leaving Quebec with the sword of Damocles hanging over its head . 
there is of course reference to the referendum process , to rules of clarity . 
as far as the rule of 50 % plus one is concerned , which is a democratic rule recognized even here in Canada , it seems to me that this ought to be clear . 
there cannot be two rules , one for Newfoundland , where it was 50 % plus one , and where the outcome was just a touch above 52 % after two referendums , and another rule for Quebec in a third referendum , whereas in the first two , where the federal government was involved , it was 50 % plus one . 
it is a pretty strange game when one player wants to change the rules partway through . 
as for the matter of the referendum question itself , that is a prerogative of the National Assembly . 
i would remind you that , right before the last referendum , the Prime Minister himself said " The question is clear . 
if you vote no , you stay in Canada . 
vote yes , and you leave Canada . " 
i would submit that if the Prime Minister understood it , then everybody understood it . 
in conclusion , as far as plan B is concerned , although I am not sure that is what it should be called since there is no longer a Plan A , I would say that the government ought to start by applying to itself the clarity it demands of others . 
it will have to tell us clearly whether it intends to honour a majority that is democratic and recognized by the people of Quebec in a referendum and whether it intends to negotiate with Quebec , as the supreme court requires it to do , the terms of its departure from the federation . 
there is a significant imbalance . 
the Speech from the Throne should have served as the government ' s opportunity to make a solemn commitment in this regard . 
however , we got simply a vague promise that there may be something in the upcoming budget without anything specific being indicated . 
so it is very vague , wishful thinking , general remarks . 
we were promised vision , we got repetition , and especially no specific action in order to ensure and develop Canadians ' quality of life . 
this theme of the Canadians ' quality of life appears as a leitmotif throughout the throne speech , as if it only needed repeating in order to convince Canadians and Quebecers that they live in the best country in the world , as the Prime Minister puts it . 
it also includes income support . 
in this area , the provinces provide the services to the public . 
and herein lies the contradiction in this country of Canada in which , on the one hand , those who provide direct services to the public do not have the means to do so and , on the other , the government that does not provide these direct services has all the money in its pockets . 
herein lies the contradiction . 
one would expect the government , which will have cut $ 33 billion between 1994 and 2004 , to restore transfer payments to the provinces , precisely to improve health and education services . 
the only thing one sees is the old Liberal habit of getting involved in provincial jurisdictions as soon as they have money . 
the government is now promising a pharmacare plan , something which already exists in Quebec , homecare and help for families and young children , instead of giving back the money to those who provide the direct services to help them fulfil their responsibilities . 
the federal government is collecting too much money , given its own jurisdictions . 
it is more than an imbalance , it is a profound injustice , a major dysfunction in the federal system . 
this imbalance leads the federal government to establish new programs to gain greater political visibility . 
this is the whole issue . 
the Liberals see the federal government as the major league . 
to them , the provinces are mere junior partners they consult when they see fit to do so and on whom they impose their will , with money taken from the citizens of those provinces , and often from budgets that should have been given to these provinces . 
as I said earlier , the federal government is not proposing anything to correct the major flaws in employment insurance . 
indeed , 60 % of those who contribute to the program are not eligible for benefits if they become unemployed . 
this is highway robbery . 
an insurance agent who behaved like the Prime Minister and the Minister of Human Resources Development would be taken to court and at risk of being sent to jail . 
this is fraud , no more and no less . 
people were expecting tax cuts for middle income families . 
nothing , once again . 
nothing about re - establishing transfer payments . 
might people not realize that there are far more poor children since this government has been in power ? 
it seems to me this is easy to understand . 
perhaps there would be less visibility but greater responsibility . 
let us look at problems of immediate concern to the government , for instance air transportation . 
at the present time , there are between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs at stake , in Quebec in particular . 
does the buddy - buddy relationship between certain members of government and the main stakeholders in this matter have anything to do with this ? 
there is nothing about shipbuilding either , yet the Bloc Quebecois had made some proposals , supported by the other three opposition parties , for a serious and rigorous shipbuilding policy . 
on the other side they are constantly boasting about this country reaching from sea to sea to sea - three oceans but no shipbuilding policy . 
they do not have much imagination . 
all of the premiers who met together in Quebec City last August supported the shipbuilding policy we proposed . 
yet there is no reference to it in this Speech from the Throne . 
and what about the situation of aboriginal people and the fisheries issue ? 
there is a mess in both cases , and now the two messes are combining into one big one . 
there is a major crisis and even if one reads this speech from start to finish , there is nothing to be found about this problem . 
i am thinking of mobility , - because we heard about mobility for citizens and students , - and because we are required to eliminate unjustified barriers to that mobility . 
can we expect to see the federal government blunder into this sector ? 
and can we expect it to meddle in the loans and scholarships issue ? 
we were told that someone should look into all the people from Vancouver who go to Montreal , and all the people from Montreal who go to Vancouver . 
come on . 
as for language of work , is Bill 101 a barrier to mobility ? 
your guess is as good as ours . 
it is to weep . 
i knew that the ambassadors have their little question and answer books , but now the Prime Minister and his ministers will be able to spread the good word throughout the country . 
it could go something like this : 
where is Ottawa ? 
Ottawa is everywhere . 
why is Ottawa everywhere ? 
because it has money . 
why does Ottawa have money ? 
because it made extensive cuts . 
what does Ottawa do with its money ? 
it does wonderful things and establishes new programs everywhere in order to enhance its visibility . 
this sounds silly , but it gives the idea . 
obviously , this government has too much money for its areas of jurisdiction , views the provinces as mere intendants , and denies the existence of the Quebec culture and people . 
therefore , I move : 
that the amendment be amended by adding , between the words " powers " and " ; and therefore '' , the following : 
" , especially by failing to recognize the existence of the Quebec people ; failed to carry out its responsibilities in the area of social welfare by not re - establishing transfer payments for programs relating to healthcare , postsecondary education and social assistance , while maintaining an inequitable and unjust employment insurance scheme '' . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it occurs to me that this afternoon ' s speech by the Prime Minister is one of the more revealing deathbed repentances I have ever witnessed in my 20 years in political life . 
after so many years of the federal Liberal government tearing down , backing away from commitments and creating crises for many Canadians and many Canadian communities , what we heard from the Prime Minister this afternoon was potentially very good news , and I say that quite sincerely . 
it is also a reminder of why it serves Canadians well to have sufficient numbers of New Democrats back in parliament to be able to push back against that reform dominance of the federal Liberal government ' s efforts over the last six years . 
on that very positive note I welcome the opportunity to enter the debate this afternoon on the throne speech that we heard yesterday . 
the throne speech is an important opportunity for members of parliament to speak about their own constituencies . 
i am immensely grateful for the privilege my constituents have bestowed upon me and for the trust they have placed in me . 
i take that trust very seriously . 
i believe that it is my responsibility to gain and regain that trust each and every day I have the privilege to remain in office and to serve as their representative in the House of Commons . 
the throne speech offers members an opportunity to note some of the particular contributions one ' s constituents have made to one ' s community and province . 
i will say a few words this afternoon about the sadness I feel , and I know the great sadness that many Canadians feel , about the recent deaths over the last 10 days of three very distinguished Canadians , Nova Scotians who have contributed enormously to the life of my province . 
one was the long serving conductor of the Atlantic Symphony and more recently the Nova Scotia Symphony , Georg Tintner . 
he was a marvellous man who came to Canada as a refugee . 
he created joy and harmony in the community through the music that he contributed and through a wonderful philosophy on life . 
he was truly a leader who provided inspiration to all of us . 
second , I was very saddened to learn yesterday of the death of Reverend Donald Skeir , a leader in Nova Scotia and particularly on behalf of black Nova Scotians for over 40 years . 
he was someone whom I had the privilege of knowing personally and of observing his terrific commitment to creating harmonious race relations and advancing the status of black Nova Scotians . 
he will be sorely missed , but he has left a great legacy for all Nova Scotians . 
third , I was very saddened this morning to open my newspaper and find that Lee Creemo had passed away on the weekend as well . 
he will be known certainly to Nova Scotians who serve with me here in the House of Commons as a great Cape Bretoner , a wonderful Mi ' kmaw who also provided music that will long be remembered . 
he was a fiddler , a champion in Canada and internationally . 
he will be missed sorely . 
i want to express my condolences to his family and to his community of Eskasoni . 
i also want to take a few moments to speak about what for me have been several highlights in my past year . 
i will long remember them as among the most inspirational in my 20 years of political life . 
we have many things that we are privileged to participate in as members of parliament in our own communities and across the country . 
for me it was a privilege that I will never forget to have been present in Nunavut on April 1 , 1999 for the official launching of the newest member of the Canadian family , the territory of Nunavut . 
i was accompanied by my colleague from Churchill River who had many friendships and relationships over the years with some of those I had the privilege to meet while in Nunavut on that special occasion . 
i think it was one of the happiest and most promising things that happened in the past year . 
it really is a testament to the many years of patient , persistent struggle by Inuit Canadians in working toward a dream that would not only provide for some reconciliation after literally centuries , of 400 years of exploitation and hardship , but would serve as a model of what people can achieve if they come together , if they work together toward a dream that they share . 
it was indeed a privilege for me to be in attendance at that very exciting event . 
pier 21 will be known to many members of the House and certainly to millions of Canadians as the point of entry for over one million immigrants , many of them refugees , to Canada between the years of 1921 and 1973 . 
my colleague from Sackville - Eastern Shore is a member of one of the immigrant families that came through Pier 21 . 
that occasion was a wonderful celebration of the contributions immigrant Canadians have made to Canadian society over not just that period of 52 years during which many immigrants and refugees came through the Halifax harbour , but the past , present and continuing contributions of the millions of immigrants and refugees who have come to Canada throughout all of our history . 
pier 21 is a very important living , breathing memorial to the contribution immigrants have made . 
it is a very timely reminder of that important immigrant history and that reality in Canada at a time when there have been some very unhappy sentiments aroused and fears generated around the arrival of Chinese refugees on our shores over the last several months . 
we have seen less than a welcoming , compassionate response to the plight of many of those people who in some cases are young children who have been exploited by a criminal element for reasons of profiteering . 
we need to be very much on guard against the kind of fearmongering that has been generated toward many of those exploited and desperate people . 
i attended it because that is one of the things one does as a member of parliament . 
i want to take this occasion to say that I found it to be a tremendously inspirational event . 
i believe the speech delivered by Canada ' s newest Governor General on that occasion was a great moment for Canada . 
what we saw in the vision put forward by Canada ' s newest Governor General was one that will be long remembered . 
we would all do well to keep in mind the very powerful message she delivered about how there are two kinds of societies in this world , forgiving societies and punishing societies . 
she urged that Canada always remain and continue to strive to be a forgiving society in every sense of the word . 
i think it is the same concept . 
sometimes we do not build enough on those positive images as we try to go about dealing with the major challenges we face in contemporary political life . 
it struck me that it was somewhat ironic , in a way a sad irony , but also a telling disappointment that a woman who came to Canada as a refugee , who has never held political office in this country and who has never to my knowledge sought political office nevertheless was able to put forward in her speech to Canadians last week a more compelling vision for the future of Canada , a more profound appreciation of Canadian history and Canadian culture and a better grasp of the challenges that we face in this country today than the current Prime Minister who has actually held office for over 30 years , and the current government that by my calculation has actually been in power in the country for 63 years during this century . 
like all good literary references , I will again quote briefly from that book because it bears repeating : 
for a maritimer there is no question that references to the ocean , to the seaside , to our marine heritage are always very positive , particularly when one comes from a riding where so much of the way of life depends on our proximity to the ocean . 
there is shipbuilding , shipping , our naval history , marine related industries and so on , and of course fishing . 
it occurred to me that maybe part of the problem with the lack of vision from the government and the Prime Minister is the fact that he spends too much time on landlocked golf courses and not enough time beside the sea where he could gain the kind of inspiration that is very much needed today in public office . 
nevertheless , the Prime Minister has made it clear that he intends to remain at the helm . 
some of his colleagues would say it would appear to be forever . 
it is certainly creating some difficulties and some manoeuvring below decks among his colleagues . 
but he has made it clear that he wants to continue to be at the helm . 
it is becoming something of a long running soap opera , not to be outdone by the continuing national soap opera between the Reform Party and the Conservative Party in trying to decide whether they want to be a divided alternative , a united alterative , or split off in three different directions . 
the Prime Minister wants to remain at the helm , but he is a bad captain . 
he has no vision and no idea of which direction to take . 
consequently , he relies on pollsters and uses taxpayers ' money to determine Canada ' s destinations for the 21 st century . 
in 1993 Canadians were told that if they put Liberals at the helm , they would launch a national child care program . 
the result is that hundreds of thousands of children and their families remain stranded when it comes to access to affordable , safe and quality child care . 
we were promised that we were on our way to home care so that families could care for their loved ones . 
we were promised that we were on our way to pharmacare so that families without drug plans could cope with inflated prescription drug costs . 
that ship has not even set sail . 
no wonder Canadians do not believe that Liberals can be trusted to keep their promises that have been set out in the throne speech . 
liberals pretend to care about our children . 
they talk in the throne speech about the importance of the early years of a child ' s life , to his or her own well - being . 
i want to say that we welcome the Prime Minister ' s announcement this afternoon of extending parental leave and maternity benefits . 
i congratulate my colleagues from Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton and Acadie - Bathurst for having worked strenuously to achieve that kind of commitment from the government . 
the question is what has the government actually done about children who are living in grinding poverty in this country ? 
there were close to one million children living in poverty already when this Prime Minister came to office . 
what has the government done ? 
it has added 500,000 more children to the ranks of poverty in Canada . 
when did the Liberal government decide that 1.5 million poor kids do not count in this country ? 
the throne speech shows clearly that the Liberal government has no intention of acting to help our young people gain access to the higher education they need . 
the Liberals ' laissez - faire attitude means more debt for our young people and more profits for the banks that finance their education . 
could it be that the government does not care about young people ? 
when did the government decide that farm children and farm communities did not count ? 
there was not a word in the throne speech about the upheaval in families and communities in Cape Breton that are facing the shutdown of the coal mining industry or those who are facing uncertain futures in the steel industry . 
when did the government decide that the families in those communities do not count ? 
the government pretends that it cares about Canada ' s physical infrastructure . Yet we are experiencing a severe crisis with respect to the future of our airline industry . 
the Speaker : 
i think we might have a solution to continuing a bit longer . 
we have just a few more minutes and I will go to questions and comments . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to pose a question to my leader , the member for Halifax , pertaining to the very difficult economic situation facing many families and communities everywhere in the country . 
i would like to ask the member to respond to what is in the Speech from the Throne for that situation and what solutions she sees . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , I think we have already heard that a number of Canadian families have been completely ignored by the government . 
let me speak about the complete lack of leadership by the government with respect to those who do not have a family with whom they can find a home , with whom they are able to live , the homeless . 
we have watched the government completely abandon any responsibility to put in place a national housing strategy , the only industrial nation in the world which does not have a national housing strategy . 
when did the government decide that the homeless did not count ? 
one of the most important principles of the recommendations in that commission ' s report was that treaty rights should be negotiated , not litigated . 
yet it is the lack of leadership by the government which has driven many aboriginal people into the courts to seek justice and to seek their rights . 
the result is that many tensions have been created by a government absolutely not prepared to provide any leadership in dealing with the inevitability of finally addressing treaty rights long overdue and disregarded . 
later this evening we are to have a take note debate on some of the tensions created in the fishery industry . 
again it is important to note that the Union of Nova Scotia Indians began to provide leadership six months ago on April 29 around the failure of the federal government to address what kinds of tensions would be created by a favourable decision on the Marshall case when it came before the supreme court . 
we now have to repair the damage done by that lack of leadership . 
there are many other areas in which the government has disregarded its responsibility to provide leadership . 
the government says that it cares about the environment all of a sudden , and thank goodness it is back on the agenda . 
however , let me say that it is very difficult for Canadians to be confident that the government will deliver on any new commitments to the environment when it has done nothing to put an end to the export of our most precious resource , our water . 
it has done nothing to address the concerns of communities in Ontario in speaking out against the importation of MOx plutonium , MOx fuel , with all the implications both short term and long term that holds for damage to our environment . 
having gutted the most important provisions and improvements to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , Canadians are wondering how they can trust the government to make a priority of the environment . 
we understand that politics is the lifeblood of a free and democratic society . 
the New Democratic Party absolutely believes in the importance of modernizing our electoral processes and our democratic institutions to ensure that they remain responsive , effective and accountable . 
the federal Liberal government has delivered many promises in its Speech from the Throne , but Canadians can be forgiven for not trusting the Liberals to deliver on those promises because of their dismal record of not doing so . 
my colleagues and I will use every opportunity available to us inside and outside of parliament to act on the concerns of ordinary Canadians to push the government to address the concerns of working people because we believe in a responsive , positive and proactive role for government . 
we believe in a vision for 21 st century Canada which includes the notion of political leadership not just by the federal government but by all levels of government working in effective partnerships with the private sector , the non - profit and co - operative sector , labour representatives , and primary producers for something that is bigger than ourselves . 
that is the legacy of my party ' s contribution to Canada . 
that is what inspired each and every one of my colleagues to seek public office and to represent our constituents and our communities as New Democrats . 
in conclusion , that is what will inspire our every move as we go about our work on behalf of our constituents . 
as Tommy Douglas once said , it is never too late to build a better world . 
let us get on with the task of working together on behalf of all constituents to build a better Canada and a better world as we go into the 21 st century . 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
we heard the leader of the NDP talk about the programs and the spending which the federal government plans to undertake . 
we also heard of some programs that she and her party would like to see added to that list . 
exactly how much higher would the leader of the New Democratic Party like to see Canadian taxes go ? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , that is a very unhelpful question which breeds much cynicism toward politics in a lot of Canadians who look at what goes on in parliament today with some distress . 
let me say very clearly that we believe the federal government or any government has a responsibility to act in a fiscally responsible manner . 
that is what the Reform Party stands for . 
that is why my party is very happy to be here with sufficient force to stand and not only push against the Reform Party agenda but finally begin to push the Liberal Party back toward a more responsible stand on some of these issues than the dominance it has had over its actions over last six years . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I begin on a congratulatory note . 
i extend my congratulations to all previous speakers and leaders . 
i also extend congratulations on behalf of the party to the new governor general , Madam Adrienne Clarkson , and offer our best wishes to the outgoing governor general , Mr. LeBlanc . 
some congratulations are also in order with respect to the Speech from the Throne which broadly and vaguely stated the government ' s willingness to look to the future . 
it is necessary to compliment the Liberal government for finally recognizing that the modern economy exists , for showing an awareness for the next century and for spending some time in the throne speech telling Canadians that new technologies will play a larger role in all our lives . 
these are penetrating statements of the obvious , yet it marks a shift in simply following the policies of a previous Conservative government and reaping the benefit of those visionary initiatives . 
we are on the verge of the 21 st century ; that is an undeniable fact . 
the Liberals acknowledge it , and that is encouraging . 
they may have taken six years to do so , but finally the government has taken the risk of stating that the country is in a period of transition and that there are a number of challenges ahead on the horizon . 
yet there is nothing in the Speech from the Throne that helps Canadians understand the direction in which the Liberals wish to steer Canada . 
nothing in the throne speech assures Canadians that the country is going in the right direction . 
the Speech from the Throne says nothing about all the complicated workings of governmental affairs . 
i compliment the government for making a grand gesture to the Canadian public yesterday , a gesture that exhibited supreme confidence in the future of the country and the ability of Canadians to respond to future challenges . 
unfortunately it was an empty and shallow gesture , one which offered no vision and no leadership . 
this was not a blueprint of where the country is headed . 
it was a pencil sketch or connect the dots . 
sadly it showed a government with no ideas , no focus and no sense of how we move the country forward , only vague notions of what the future might look like . 
Canadians want some serious issues addressed , issues like increasing the tax burden , the agricultural crisis in western Canada , the issue of immigration , or the consequences of a hostile takeover resulting in a single national airline . 
those looking for these issues to be addressed in the throne speech were sadly disappointed . 
there were a lot of right sounding words in the throne speech , words like knowledge economy , building a higher quality of life , technology and advancing Canada ' s place in the world . 
these are all important issues that this parliament will have to address , but beyond the catch phrases themselves there was nothing , nothing new and nothing that explains the purpose of the government . 
it is disheartening to see over the course of several months that the federal government failed to prepare itself for this new parliament , even with the three - week delay in the opening . 
it failed to meet the demands of Canadians for a responsible government and for the delivery of a vigorous new plan for this parliament . 
it has also failed to anticipate the Supreme Court decision in Marshall , the void that it would create and the chaos it would initiate . 
it is appropriate now to quote a respected Canadian philosopher , John Ralston Saul , who wrote : 
the modern tools of communication become the tools of propaganda . 
and fear of the consequences of non - conformity is propagated . 
this statement takes on a wonderful clarity and irony in the context of yesterday ' s throne speech . 
what was the meaning behind the promises we heard ? 
were they one line promises with little if any detail on how exactly these promises were to be implemented ? 
it was much like we have seen from previous throne speeches from the government . 
much of what we heard were ideas generated by the PC Party of Canada or ideas that have been long media tested , words that sound wonderful and warm people ' s hearts but do not amount to much . 
no one would deny that we need to improve our commitment on children ' s issues , to a stronger economy , to a quality health care , to aboriginal peoples amongst other issues . 
these we can all agree on but where were the details ? 
when can Canadians count on the government to explain its vision in a manner that provides answers rather than more questions ? 
we have heard much about the Liberal ' s concept of diversity . 
we heard it many times in yesterday ' s speech . 
how can the government speak of respecting diversity when it chooses to antagonize Quebec , when it chooses to antagonize Atlantic Canada , the west and other regions and when it chooses to antagonize every region of the country with alienating provocative approaches to federalism ? 
we need to encourage Canadians if we are to evolve as a strong and united country . 
when the government ignores the plight of western farmers or Atlantic fishers it shows that it respects diversity only when it falls within the Liberal agenda . 
it demonstrates that it is only a true crisis that evokes a response and even then the government responds slowly and inadequately . 
it is heartening to know that the government has finally recognized the priority that needs to be given to environmental issues , six years too late , I might add . 
and still the Liberals have done nothing more than to affirm and reaffirm Canada ' s commitment to the Kyoto protocols and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions . 
the government speaks of a children ' s agenda but it has not taken any meaningful action to protect the environment in which our children will live . 
thankfully , some industries have stepped up the challenge and have taken meaningful steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to do so from their factories . 
others have not been so noble . 
the government needs to stop talking about the reduction of harmful greenhouse emissions and start meaningful implementation of those commitments . 
they continue to do so . 
they continue to be a part of Canada ' s overall economy despite Liberal government indifference . 
where on earth was the commitment to our brave men and women of the armed forces for equipment and resources to ensure their safety and success ? 
this glaring omission speaks volumes . 
within the pages of the speech there was a flavour of the abandonment of the past . 
while the push to the future is a noble ideal , we cannot forget the fact that our traditional industries continue to provide meaningful work in areas of high unemployment . 
the speech was littered with reaffirmations of previously unfulfilled promises or commitments . 
as a Maritime member , it becomes obvious that the lack of focus on significant industries will have a negative impact . 
it sends a message to Atlantic Canadians and others that they are not a high priority for the Liberal government . 
one only has to look at the results of the last federal election and two recent provincial elections in the Atlantic provinces to know how Atlantic Canadians react when ignored . 
when the Liberal government speaks of high technology and of the knowledge based economy bringing a higher quality of life to Canadians , it neglects to mention that the costs to the quality of life in our smaller communities amongst fishers , farmers and miners will be hurt . 
let us build a stronger future by encouraging and connecting Canadians from coast to coast . 
let us not disconnect from the important industries that continue to drive the economy . 
it is appropriate tonight that we in the House will be participating in a debate on the crisis emerging in the commercial fishing industry between native and non - native fishers . 
the government has tiptoed around this critical issue for weeks allowing it to fester and grow to the point of confrontation and violence . 
let us hope that the government uses tonight ' s debate as an opportunity to reset its priorities and focus on the necessity of finding a swift and long term resolution to this crisis . 
this must be an inclusive focus on consensus building and it must avoid the base political antagonism that has been practised by some . 
we have learned recently that aboriginal chiefs , including those who have until now supported the moratorium , have just left the meeting in New Brunswick and that the fisheries self - imposed moratorium is now off . 
this means that boats and traps will be put back in the water and there is a serious issue that needs to be addressed and addressed quickly . 
across the country other crises emerge . 
the crisis faced by the western farm families went literally and figuratively unnoticed in yesterday ' s throne speech . 
the low agricultural prices caused by subsidies among our trading partners threatens to put many Canadian farmers out of business completely . 
this issue needs government action before it is too late . 
there is nothing in the throne speech that will stem the brain drain . 
far too many young Canadians are forced to move away from home and family depriving their communities of the knowledge and the skills necessary to build a strong foundation for the country in the 21 st century . 
we cannot wait for more Centres of Excellence to be established and more implementations of millennium scholarships . 
we can do more than simply applaud the government ' s commitment to a free trade arena or area of the Americas by the year 2005 . 
we can do that but it is finally heartening to see that free trade has become a government priority . 
free trade is something that this party initiated . 
i would certainly like to see the Liberal government undertake this effort with as much vigour and tenacity as it did with its anti - free trade efforts in 1993 . 
the reality is that the Liberal track record has been about declining productivity and investment , record levels of taxation and punishing regulations and red tape . 
pie in the sky platitudes are not enough for Canadians and after six years they should and do expect more . 
at best , we have seen incomes decline . 
the Liberal government ' s lack of vision and leadership is actually destroying and undermining Canadians ' quality of life not improving it as the throne speech would have us believe . 
the government needs to cut taxes starting with personal income taxes and capital gains taxes . 
we must put money back in the pockets of those who have earned it and allow them to generate economic growth . 
the government must set firm , achievable debt reduction targets . 
the PC Party of Canada has given specifics about where it stands on tax issues such as the decrease in the capital gains tax and a full indexation of tax brackets . 
the Liberal government has remained silent . 
our party will continue to consult with experts and Canadians on this matter . 
our federal government chooses to avoid consultation . 
this reluctance to put forward a plan for tax cuts is part of a trend . 
we have not seen any ground - breaking initiatives in the last six years that would reverse the trend . 
the government ' s commitment to seasonal workers is abysmal . 
agriculture , natural resource workers , middle class families and scores of other Canadians have been ignored and undercut by the government . 
tax reduction is fundamental to the economic well being of Canadians and tax relief , more dollars being left in the hands of families with children , would be a step in that direction . 
to help children , the government must help parents of those children with meaningful tax relief . 
in the throne speech , the government said it would make a third significant investment in the national child benefit but there are no details of exactly how much the government will invest nor are there any contingency plans should the provinces and territories choose not to co - operate . 
the government even created a separate ministry aimed at poverty but with no budget and no mandate and then tried to convince Canadians that it had addressed the problem . 
Canadians will not be fooled . 
there are more examples of more promises and no action . 
the government ' s day to day management of native issues contradicts the promise that aboriginal people will be able to more fully participate and contribute to Canada ' s economy . 
this paternalistic attitude flies in the face of the government ' s pledge to promote greater aboriginal self - reliance . 
the government ' s attempt to present itself in a caring and compassionate way as a government that helps families and children in particular is a sham . 
however , in the Year of Older Persons nowhere was there even a mention of seniors . 
to quote my colleague from Saint John : 
too often in our society today , seniors are overlooked and ignored . 
our society is aging , and as it does , more and more seniors are falling through the cracks - substandard housing , inadequate health care , and in many cases , just plain neglect . 
yet this government didn ' t see fit to mention them even once in their blueprint for the new millennium . 
whether I speak of families , children or of the elderly , it is obvious that when it comes time to implement legislation that would be truly beneficial the government has constantly failed to deliver . 
one need only look at the government ' s chance to reform family law and strengthen support with the joint common senate committee on child custody in 1997 . 
the government ignored its report and the justice minister has already indicated that she wants more consultations that will last until the year 2002 . 
another area where the Liberal government has failed to deliver has been with the new Youth Criminal Justice Act . 
it has called this legislation a priority yet it has refused to acknowledge how it is going to pay for this when it is already not living up to the monetary commitments under the old young offenders act . 
the lack of attention to youth crime has spilled over into other areas of law enforcement . 
an abysmal lack of funding for the RCMP has constantly forced our Mounties to do more with less . 
this has literally endangered the officers and the public at large . 
bowing to public pressure , the government is now expecting the already overworked members of our national police force to combat high tech crimes such as money laundering , organized crime and the smuggling of people , guns and drugs . 
the government speaks of public safety as its number one priority yet it continues to release dangerous offenders into our communities . 
finally we have more Liberal rhetoric regarding the future of health care . 
it is fine for Liberals to talk about improving our health care system but it cannot be forgotten that the dire straits of health care in the country was created by this government . 
by simply putting money back in when it does not even equal the amount of money that was taken out , our health care system will not improve . 
this approach simply will not cut it . 
accessible and universal health care is one of the things for which Canadians take the most amount of pride . 
we are very anxious to see how this government plans to keep the proud tradition of our health care system alive . 
certainly this throne speech gives no hint . 
they are sadly off course . 
the Throne Speech represents a government whose vision is a mile wide and an inch deep . 
there were some fine platitudes about this country ' s potential but there was nothing that provided Canadians with an understanding of where this government is coming from , and where it is going . 
with the dawn of the new millennium , this Liberal government had a golden opportunity to present a comprehensive plan on the path that the country should take . 
sadly that opportunity was missed and the government has traded vision for vagueness at the expense of all Canadians . 
madam Speaker , on behalf of the Right Hon. Joe Clark and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada , I thank you for the opportunity to present our response to the throne speech . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
i am not sure about this , but my understanding is that there was a meeting held in Moncton , New Brunswick today and the chiefs have decided to put their traps back in the water tomorrow . 
these are not just the New Brunswick chiefs , but the Atlantic chiefs . 
what the government did with regard to the fishing situation in all of Canada from coast to coast was not addressed . 
i would like to hear from the hon. member as to what he thinks should have been in that speech . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
madam Speaker , it has become obvious that not only was there an omission in the throne speech but also there was a lax approach by the government to this emerging crisis . 
it was two weeks before the government chose to act . 
going back even further , it is shocking to think that the government did not anticipate or foresee that this was one of the possible scenarios the supreme court could follow in its decision in the Marshall case . 
i know that members of this party , members from South Shore , West Nova , Southwest Nova , Petitcodiac , Beaus é jour , our newest member , and Saint John have worked very diligently to meet with both the native and non - native fishers to get their ideas and input . 
i am encouraged to see that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has followed that tack . 
now the time has come to sit down with these members to try to come up with a solution that is going to work respecting the need for conservation and respecting what the supreme court has done in a meaningful but measured way to avoid violence or possible death in this issue . 
it has to be done quickly . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
pursuant to order adopted earlier today , the House will now proceed to the consideration of the motion concerning Canadian fisheries . 
* * * 
special DEBATE 
fisheries 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) moved : 
that this House take note of the difficulties in Canadian fisheries , especially as complicated by the Queen and Marshall case and its implications for both aboriginal and non - aboriginal peoples and for the future management of natural resources . 
i appreciate this opportunity to bring members of parliament up to date on the developments in Atlantic Canada following a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada . 
many members have been following the story in media reports over the past four weeks , but this is the first chance I have had to tell the House personally what is happening . 
i think it is important for members of parliament to understand the background to this issue and what I am going to do to resolve it . 
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall case is an important judgment that affirms certain rights of the Mi ' kmaq and Maliseet peoples flowing from the historical treaties with the crown . 
as a result of this judgment we will have to consider a number of fundamental questions about the management of the fishery . 
in this new reality our challenge is to find ways to work together to secure the future of the fishery for both aboriginal and non - aboriginal communities . 
we must formulate a process for integrating fishing under the treaty right in the overall fishery . 
we need to develop a management scheme that will respect the treaty right described by the court while being sensitive to the social and economic realities of the Atlantic fishery and those who depend on it . 
when the supreme court handed down its judgment on September 17 , the issue had my immediate and full attention . 
we have been working with federal departments to analyse the implications of the judgment . 
in addition , we engaged in immediate and continuous dialogue with aboriginal communities , provincial governments and other stakeholders in the fisheries . 
throughout this past month I have been heartened to hear the clear commitment to conservation and to co - operation expressed by the Mi ' kmaq chiefs . 
from the beginning our objective has been to achieve an effective management regime which represents a supreme court judgment and is fair to the interest in the fisheries . 
through the goodwill , patience and restraint that has been demonstrated by all participants , we have made considerable progress toward this goal . 
the treaty signed in 1760 between the British and the Mi ' kmaq was called the Peace and Friendship Treaty . 
we should keep those words in mind , peace and friendship , as we work together toward the long term solution . 
the supreme court decision is complex and its full implications are not yet totally clear . 
however , since September 17 we have clarified a number of issues raised . 
let me summarize what we understand about the judgment . 
the court has affirmed that the beneficiaries of the treaty have a right to , among other things , fish , hunt and gather and trade the products of these activities for necessaries . 
translated into modern terms the judgment indicates this right entitles the beneficiaries to have the opportunity to gain a moderate livelihood from the exercise of their fishing , hunting and gathering activities . 
there are many considerations that will be central to our efforts as we move forward in concert with all the parties . 
for example , we consider this to be a communal right and not an individual right . 
to be clear , even though the right is exercised by individuals , it is for the benefit of the collective . 
it is our view that the treaty applies to the aboriginal communities that best represent the modern manifestation of the original signatories . 
our initial assessment is that the Mi ' kmaq and the Maliseet Indian bands in Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , and the Listiguj first nation in Quebec are the modern manifestations of the collectives that benefited from the treaties . 
we now need to focus on a process that will allow us to accommodate the treaty right . 
we will involve in this process all who are directly concerned with the sustainability and the viability of the Atlantic fishery . 
i became involved earlier on this issue and I have worked closely with natives , with commercial fishers , with federal departments and with provincial premiers to find short and long term solutions . 
when the supreme court judgment was delivered on September 17 and others in government sought a clear understanding of the implications , we worked quickly to analyse some fundamental questions about the management of the fishery and how to address them . 
some court decisions take years to interpret . 
in this case we had a preliminary assessment in less than two weeks ' time . 
unfortunately , emotions ran high in some communities which resulted in serious property damage , injuries and violence . 
those events deeply saddened me and many other Canadians across the country . 
it is important for us to work together . 
in the meantime we are working on a process that will accommodate both commercial and native fisheries for years to come . 
i would like to extend my personal thanks to all the chiefs and members of the industry who took the time to meet with me to share their views and concerns . 
since the beginning I have said that I would respect the decisions of the chiefs , and that continues to be my position . 
i also want to commend the people in area 35 who together , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , found community based solutions . 
the decision that was handed down on September 17 by the supreme court left many unanswered questions . 
we need time to work together . 
but thanks to the willingness of all those who keep the lines of communication open , we have made progress . 
aboriginal members of the fishing sector , the province , the federal government have all shown a strong will to resolve this issue . 
what was really important when I met with the chiefs in Atlantic Canada was the long term issue . 
many of the chiefs felt that we must not focus on the short term and detract from what are the real issues , which is a long term issue . 
that is what I hope to focus on , that we begin a process , a comprehensive plan of progress with all those parties that are affected by the fisheries issues , to bring them together and talk about real solutions . 
real solutions can come about through dialogue and through co - operation , with people working together , sitting around the table looking at each other eye to eye and talking about the problems and how they can resolve them . 
we have been working on a short term solution . 
i know the chiefs are meeting today . 
until I hear from them directly , I will not comment whether they in fact have decided to lift the moratorium or not , because this is something that they have done on a voluntary basis . 
certainly I would be disappointed if that is the decision they have made , but I will wait until they have directly contacted me before I comment on that . 
an hon. member has said that I have not had contact . 
i will wait to see if that is the case . 
natives and non - natives have lived and worked together for generations since that time in peace and harmony . 
together with patience , restraint , respect for the law and with the co - operation of everyone , we can turn the spirit for the next century . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the House order made earlier today provides that there shall be no request for unanimous consent , so I am afraid that request cannot be granted . 
we will proceed to questions and comments . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , the government failed to obtain the court ' s objectives in the Marshall ruling . 
it had no management plan in place in the event of a decision in favour of this treaty right and it has made no attempt either in its presentation to the court or since to balance the interests of other Canadians in the face of the treaty right granted by the court . 
the minister has suggested in his speech and elsewhere that he will apply this treaty right as a communal right . 
he has said that the communal right will be exercised by individuals for the benefit of all . 
i would like to know how he will be able to determine a moderate living if he is going to apply this as a communal right . 
if we consider a moderate living for all of the Mi ' kmaq , if that is his objective , it is obvious that there will be nothing left for anybody else . 
i would like the minister , very clearly , to answer the question of how a moderate living could be determined if the treaty right is applied as a communal right . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal : 
madam Speaker , the communal right is seen as a collective right . 
i am sure the hon. member is very much aware of what that means . 
how we define a moderate livelihood , as described by the courts , is something that we have to sit around the table on . 
we have to work with the aboriginal community and with all the parties together . 
we must ask how we can ensure that the aboriginal people who are the beneficiaries of this treaty right are going to exercise it . 
we need to define those terms , but we need to define them in conjunction with the aboriginal people , by sitting around the table and talking with them . 
if we were to ask everybody in this room how to define that we would have 30 different definitions . 
it is something that has to be negotiated . 
we have to sit at the table and do it . 
i have always felt that it is better to negotiate than to go to the courts , but there are others out there who refuse to move forward . 
even when we introduced the aboriginal fishing strategy after Sparrow many said that we could not move forward . 
the last Conservative government was not any better at predicting what the supreme court was going to do with respect to Sparrow . 
however , we were trying to bring the aboriginal community into the fishery . 
buying up licences was one way we were doing it . 
we have already tried to work things out through negotiation . 
however , when we go to the courts we have to go by what they put forward and we have to live with their views . 
one of the challenges we have is to define a moderate livelihood . 
it is something we will have to sit around the table to deal with . 
that is why we need to focus on the long term and not on the short term issues that distract us . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
let the record show that there was not one mention by the minister of the people who are going to be displaced . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , I welcome the brand new Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to the portfolio . 
i was glad to hear him tell the House and all Canadians listening that it is indeed better to negotiate than it is to litigate . 
in the Bay of Fundy region , District 35 opens up its commercial offshore season tomorrow . 
the Bay of Fundy inshore fishermen are working very closely with the aboriginal people to come up with a long term solution . 
the problem is , they are doing it on their own with no help at all from DFO officials . 
will the minister commit the necessary human and financial resources to aid those people in their co - operative effort toward a long term solution ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal : 
madam Speaker , I welcome the hon. member ' s comments . 
what we want to do is start working as soon as possible on a long term solution by bringing people together . 
in the next weeks I will come forward with a plan , which will include all parties , to bring everyone around the table . 
we want to make sure that we start as soon as possible . 
certainly the input of the member will be very valuable as we move forward . 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I look forward to Reform members ' interventions in this debate . 
it is always very interesting to see where they are coming from . 
i am pleased to join my hon. colleague in debating this motion . 
the supreme court has provided valuable guidance on how an agreement between two parties , the 1760 - 61 Mi ' kmaq treaty , should be interpreted as we enter the 21 st century . 
however , the court did not specify how those treaty rights are to be implemented and respected both now and in the future . 
it is very important for people to understand that the court ' s decision is complex and far - reaching . 
there are no quick and easy solutions , as has been suggested by some people already this evening . 
a constructive resolution requires that all parties work together to respect an affirmed treaty right in a way that is sensitive to the interests of all those who rely on the fishery for their livelihood . 
we have much more work ahead of us - governments , first nations and non - first nations - to reconcile and understand the court ' s interpretation of this and other historic treaties . 
the process by which we can work together toward finding a settlement is not new . 
in fact , it is well under way . 
our commitment to negotiate with first nations in the spirit of partnership is ongoing . 
so too is our commitment to finding settlements to legitimate outstanding first nations obligations . 
these commitments were reconfirmed last year with the launch of " Gathering Strength - Canada ' s Aboriginal Action Plan '' . 
the government ' s response to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples affirmed that agreements are best negotiated in a way that respects the rights and concerns of first nations and those of their neighbours . 
this is nothing new . 
we see it taking place across the country every day . 
on the west coast the British Columbia Treaty Commission is negotiating modern day treaties with 51 first nations where no settlements were negotiated . 
in the Yukon , comprehensive claim settlements , self - government and shared resource management are returning certainty to the territory . 
in the Atlantic region a process is under way with first nations to find approaches to identify and settle legitimate outstanding obligations to first nations . 
the same spirit of partnership will be needed to understand historic treaties . 
in " Gathering Strength " we said that the continuing treaty relationship provides the context of mutual rights and responsibilities which will ensure that aboriginal and non - aboriginal people can together enjoy the benefits of this great land . 
unfortunately , for too many years first nations have not fully enjoyed the benefits of this great land , in part because they have had limited access to fish , forests , minerals and other natural resources . 
yet , court rulings have consistently and clearly demonstrated that first nations do indeed have rights . 
they have worked relentlessly to have aboriginal and treaty rights recognized . 
i would like to quote from a letter to the editor in today ' s edition of the Vancouver Sun . 
miles Richardson , the chief commissioner of the British Columbia Treaty Commission , writes : " Aboriginal rights exist whether or not they are set out in a treaty or agreed to by anyone . 
but without a treaty it is unclear about how and where those treaties apply . 
the courts have continually said that the best way to resolve these issues is through good faith negotiations with give and take on all sides '' . 
i agree completely with those words . 
i can confirm that my department is working in partnership with first nations and other governments across Canada to ensure that treaties are fully respected . 
it is clear that the supreme court ruling on the Marshall case has implications for the people of Atlantic Canada , both first nations and non - first nations . 
my colleague , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , is working very hard to arrive at a fair and equitable solution involving access to Atlantic fishery resources in light of the Marshall decision . 
the impact of the Marshall case likely will not be confined to fish and it likely will not be confined to Atlantic Canada . 
i will be reviewing with others involved how these broader issues should be addressed . 
i think we are seeing that the days are gone when one minister , the minister of Indian affairs , is the only one working on or speaking to aboriginal issues . 
these issues are of significant importance to all ministers and I commend and support my colleague , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , for his efforts . 
my role is broader . 
i see it as having the federal lead to work closely with first nation leaders , my provincial counterparts and my cabinet colleagues to explore together an overall approach to the broader question of the treaty relationship and aboriginal access to resources . 
as the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development I am just one person among many who is working on or speaking to aboriginal issues . 
these issues are of significant importance to all ministers . 
again , I commend the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for his efforts . 
together we will explore an overall approach to the broader question of the treaty relationship and aboriginal access to resources . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
there are many members who wish to ask questions tonight . 
therefore I suggest that we limit our questions and answers to one minute in order to give as many members as possible the chance to intervene . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , it is very difficult to get the opportunity to ask a question tonight and I will keep it to one minute . 
with regard to the minister ' s statement there is one looming question that needs to be asked . 
in the 1950 s and 1960 s a lobster licence in southwest Nova Scotia could be bought for $ 1 . 
i believe prior to that a licence was 25 cents . 
what kept any first nations from the lobster fishery at that time ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault : 
madam Speaker , obviously members who have a preoccupation with the fishing strategy are asking very specific questions , but they seem to have lost the gist of the speech and what I was trying to suggest . 
i want to make it very clear to members that when the courts rule on particular rights of first nations they rule with the intent of saying to Canadians and to governments , provincial and federal , that the rights exist . 
then they suggest to parliamentarians and members who are on the government side that they sit down with the aboriginal people to negotiate how those benefits from the treaty will flow , and they flow in a number of ways : from the economic development side of the issue , which was mentioned by my colleague earlier in his question to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans ; the issue of how first nations people would be involved in the regulatory regime of the fishery itself ; how they would be involved in other resources ; and in gathering , which was part of the statement that was made by the court . 
those issues were not defined . 
that was the whole issue . 
for someone to be as simplistic as to say that we should be prepared and coming out with a plan tomorrow and saying here it is , that is not what the courts asked us to do . 
the courts have asked us to sit down with the first nations and to define exactly how that treaty right will benefit them . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , we have been hearing a lot of words over there about how the government will try to work to effect a compromise between aboriginal and non - aboriginal fishermen on the east coast . 
for the benefit of those listening or watching the debate tonight , I would like them to know that this is the same minister , when push came to shove on the Musqueam reserve , who sent eviction notices to all non - aboriginal leaseholders on that reserve because the insensitive and belligerent chief of the Musqueam insisted that be done . 
could the minister tell us what comfort the fishermen on the east coast can take by his words and those of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans when this is the kind of action we have seen from the government consistently , time after time , when it has come down to an issue between aboriginal and non - aboriginal rights ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault : 
madam Speaker , any time an aboriginal community tries to create an economic development opportunity for themselves it becomes a win - lose for the Reform Party . 
i see the Musqueam issue as a win - win in the sense that first nations people will make economic benefit from this legally binding contract . 
i do not know what the Reform Party would like to see the Government of Canada do . 
if its members would give us their position on that particular file , if they would like us to subsidize the first nations to the tune of $ 7 million to deal with it , I would be prepared to look at it . 
so far all the Reform Party is doing is running at aboriginal people but not giving us solutions as to how we deal with the situation . 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I will be setting up a number of tables . 
those tables will be like any other negotiation that we have done in B.C. or across the country , as I have mentioned earlier . 
we will sit down with the people , the chiefs of the Atlantic region and other interest groups , and we will then come up with a resolution as to how best to proceed with the treaty right confirmed by the court . 
that will not happen tomorrow , next week or the week after . 
we will set up these tables and we will work through it over the winter . 
we hope that in the short term , which is in the next year , we will have some solutions to the issues . 
that is how it will be done . 
it is not the simplistic view of some members opposite that we should just go out there and ask people to break the law or change the law because we do not like the results of what the courts have ruled . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , on September 17 , 1999 , the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision in Regina versus Marshall . 
the effect of that judgment is quite clear . 
the situation in law now is that before fisheries managers can lawfully open the fishery to others , the Mi ' kmaq people must be accorded the opportunity to fully satisfy their rights for a moderate livelihood . 
in other words they are given a priority right to fish . 
this follows from the order of priority set out in Sparrow and in other cases which establish firmly that aboriginal treaty rights have priority over general , commercial and sport fishing rights . 
moderate livelihood is defined as including such basics as food , clothing and housing supplemented by a few amenities , but not the accumulation of wealth . 
it simply addresses day to day needs . 
this definition is broad and hopelessly vague . 
what happens if there is some doubt as to when to close the fishery ? 
the practice of erring on the side of aboriginal fishing rights seems to have been adopted as a method of keeping DFO managers on safe ground and free of legal challenges to their decisions . 
the present situation also allows for the courts to strike down the current regulations of the fishing rights of the Mi ' kmaq because these regulations did not have any specific accommodation in regulation as a priority right . 
the minister ' s absolute discretion under the Fisheries Act , which is the basis for the current regulations , was not held to be adequate protection of the treaty right . 
unrestrained fishing can take place by the Mi ' kmaq until such time as a valid regulatory regime can be put in place . 
that may take months or even years since consultation must take place beforehand . 
before I go any further I will look back at the situation in British Columbia because the experience there with preferential fishing rights accorded to natives is not a happy one . 
as a result the Liberal government asked John Fraser , a former Minister of Fisheries and Speaker of the House , to investigate the management system in place on the Fraser River . 
the fact of the matter was that the problem was visited on us because of the poor regulations which were in place , poor enforcement and so on of that native commercial fishery . 
prior to 1992 the fishery on the Fraser River was a profitable one . 
this past year commercial fishing was completely closed on the Fraser River for the first time in history . 
that came about as a direct result of the aboriginal fishing policy and the commercial fishing regulations which were put in place by the government . 
there is no question about that . 
over time the government has blamed nature , acts of God : the water was too high ; the water was too low ; the water was too warm ; the water was too cold ; it was El Nino ; it was La Nina , all these problems . 
when they look at that collapse they say it was El Nino in the north Pacific in the last couple of years . 
what happened ? 
why was it that there were strong returns of sockeye to Port Alberni on Vancouver Island this year ? 
why is it that in Alaska they anticipated 25 million sockeye to return to Bristol Bay and we ended up with over 40 million ? 
those fish were swimming in the same waters in the north Pacific as the fish from Fraser River . 
those returns came back strong . 
the minister talks about supreme court decisions and the effect they have on the government . 
supreme court decisions are not made in isolation . 
what did the crown do , the crown being the Liberal government ? 
in the first instance the crown expert witness described the prohibition on Mi ' kmaq trading peltry with any other than the British as a Mi ' kmaq right to trade . 
second , the expert witness conceded that the treaty right included a right to trade fish although peltry was the only commodity cited in the treaty and the price list agreed to by the chiefs and the British did not include fish . 
how do we get from an agreement which does not include fish and which is a restriction on trading rights to a priority right to fish ? 
i will tell the House how . 
the government had in place a policy on the west coast which gave to natives a priority right to fish . 
how can it have that kind of policy in place and sustained on one coast and then go to court and try to deny it on the other ? 
it cannot be done and the government knows it . 
it did not do it and that is why we are in the jam we are in now . 
there is another interesting oversight by the government . 
the crown also failed to enter into argument the public right to fish . 
the public right to fish has existed in British common law since the Magna Carta . 
the public right to fish guarantees all of us equal access to the fishery . 
that public right can only be broken by the House . 
it takes an act of parliament to allow for separate native commercial fisheries . 
that has not happened on the west coast . 
there is no act of parliament dealing with it . 
those fisheries are operating illegally . 
that treaty should not then have been interpreted as an exclusive right or as a priority right given the underlying right that we all enjoyed , the public right to fish . 
the crown failed to enter evidence demonstrating the social and economic impact on the maritime fishery if the Mi ' kmaq were awarded the right to fish commercially . 
the crown also failed to argue that a decision in favour of a commercial fishery on eels , there being no viable commercial fishery in the maritimes on eels , could result in a commercial fishery on other species such as lobster . 
the crown failed to introduce evidence such as the 1995 fisheries conservation council report which suggested that lobster were already overharvested so that any official entry into the fishery through a treaty would mean an existing participant in the public commercial fishery would have to be displaced . 
in other words , the crown failed to represent to the court the situation that currently exists , a situation in which a fishery is already oversubscribed , in which there are already too many participants according to the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council , and in which allowing the entry of others would require the displacement of those who are currently exercising rights to fish . 
that argument should have been put in place and it was not . 
the government overlooked it . 
it is not the first time a tragic oversight by the government has happened in arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
in Delgamuukw , the federal government supported aboriginal claims to self - government and the continued existence of aboriginal title . 
it caused the logging disputes we had this summer and the flagrant breaking of law , not to mention the hardship . 
the minister , himself , mentioned just moments ago that these rights would extend to logging , mining and so on . 
there is chaos and turmoil in eastern Canada . 
shortly after this decision came down , I offered the minister a reasonable and legal escape route . 
i sent it to him in a letter and I sent that letter to the provincial governments affected . 
i told him that what he should do first is to seek a stay of judgment and , second , to seek a rehearing of the case . 
it is clear what the effect of a stay of judgment would be . 
it would simply allow for a cooling off period . 
it would have allowed the government time to pool its resources and to figure out what it was going to do with the situation it was faced with . 
the second thing it would do is this . 
by asking for a rehearing it would have given the government , the attorneys general of the provinces involved and other stakeholders , whether they be fishermen ' s organizations , processing organizations or the communities affected , the opportunity to go to the supreme court and say " Look , if this decision moves ahead this is the impact it is going to have on our communities '' . 
it would have given those stakeholders a chance to say " Look , when you dealt with the Gladstone decision of the supreme court you acknowledged that others had rights '' . 
that Gladstone decision dealt with an inherent aboriginal right to commercially fish herring roe on kelp . 
even though it was found to be an inherent aboriginal right , the court acknowledged that others had acquired rights as well . 
that argument was not taken to the supreme court by the government . 
it left it out . 
it refused to bring that forward . 
it refused to defend the interests of current stakeholders . 
the fisheries oversubscribed . 
if we take away their access to the resource what is left ? 
it is not only the fishermen who will go out of business , it is the processors , the guy who runs the gas station and the guy in the grocery store . 
it trickles right down . 
it will destroy the economy . 
nothing is gained by taking from one who is simply making a living and giving it to another . 
in my view it is imperative for the court to rehear this matter . 
neither Parliament nor the provincial legislatures have the power to deal with the matter , it having been put out of reach of the legislative branch by sections 35 ( 1 ) and 52 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . 
the notwithstanding clause is not available since section 35 ( 1 ) is not a part of the charter . 
the only legislative remedy is a constitutional amendment by Parliament and the legislatures of seven provinces containing 50 % of the population of Canada . 
this is probably impractical . 
the minister says to negotiate . 
negotiations would be lovely but they can only be successful if one goes to the table with something in one ' s hand . 
the minister has no cards . 
he has no chips on the table . 
he gave it all away when he failed to score points and make the proper arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i want to quote three passages from the Gladstone decision of the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i want to show which references the government could use if it sought the court ' s advice on this matter . 
these three passages would provide legal weight to an escape route from this problem . 
the first quotation reads : 
it should also be noted that the aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s . 35 ( 1 ) exist within a legal context in which , since the time of the Magna Carta , there has been a common law right to fish in tidal waters that can only be abrogated by competent legislation . 
this is from R . v Gladstone , paragraph 67 . 
the second quotation reads : 
while the elevation of common law aboriginal rights to constitutional status obviously has an impact on the public ' s common law rights to fish in tidal waters , it was surely not intended that , by enactment of s . 35 ( 1 ) , those common law rights would be extinguished in cases where an aboriginal right to harvest fish commercially existed . 
this is R . v Gladstone , paragraph 67 . 
the last quotation reads : 
although by no means making a definitive statement on this issue , I would suggest that with regards to the distribution of the fisheries resources after conservation goals have been met , objectives such as the pursuit of economic and regional fairness , and the recognition of the historical reliance upon , and participation in , the fishery by non - aboriginal groups , are the type of objectives which can ( at least in the right circumstances ) satisfy this standard . 
in the right circumstances , such objectives are in the interest of all Canadians and , more importantly , the reconciliation of aboriginal societies with the rest of Canadian society may well depend upon their successful attainment . 
this is R . v Gladstone , paragraph 75 . 
that says it all . 
by not arguing for the rights of other Canadians when this matter was before the court , the government has put peace and good government in the country in jeopardy . 
it has walked away from the very legitimate concerns that other Canadians have for their fishery , the legitimate interests that other Canadians have to earn a living from the fishery . 
it is beyond belief that this could happen . 
DFO could balance the interests of Canadians in several ways . 
it could state , as did the court : that the federal government has the ultimate responsibility to balance the interests of all Canadians ; that there will be only one commercial fishery operating under the same rules and regulations ; that the treaty right will be accommodated by issuing commercial licences to fish in the public commercial fishery alongside other Canadians ; that any licence issued to the treaty fishery will be offset by a licence that the government purchased from a voluntary seller of a licence in the public commercial fishery . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
i must interrupt the member . 
his time is really over . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
we are on the eve of the Bay of Fundy lobster season beginning tomorrow morning . 
it is going to affect communities in my riding . 
we understand that there is now a withdrawal by some of the native fishers on the 30 day moratorium . 
there is tremendous chaos looming right now which the government could have prevented with an appropriate pre - emptive strategy that was more long term in nature . 
i would appreciate the member ' s feedback on that . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , the government ' s response to my position that a stay could be sought from the Supreme Court of Canada and that a rehearing of the judgment would be appropriate was simply to reject it as unfounded . 
i did not just pull that suggestion out of the air . 
i consulted with some prominent constitutional lawyers in my home province of British Columbia , lawyers who have experience before the Supreme Court of Canada . 
it was their suggestion and one that is very real . 
a caller mentioned to me early this morning that some of the bands that had committed to participating in the moratorium had simply moved their gear and placed it elsewhere . 
i cannot confirm this , but if the moratorium has been broken , the government should use the opportunity to say that the situation is out of hand and out of control and that it would be best to go back to the supreme court to seek some legitimate advice on how to handle the situation . 
it has 30 days to do that . 
in other words , there are only about three days left for the government to make that representation to the supreme court . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , we have a very serious situation on our hands . 
as everybody can appreciate , it is very serious for those of us who live in coastal communities and for those of us who live along the sea . 
it always disturbs me when I hear the situation presented as the hon. member who just spoke presented it , to rehear the case . 
it reminds me of people tossing a coin to see who goes first . 
they want to keep going until they get it the way they want it . 
it seems very unusual to talk about rehearing a supreme court decision . 
i wonder if the hon. member would have taken the same position if the decision had come down not in favour of the aboriginal treaties . 
we have a very serious situation . 
the court has ruled . 
it has made a decision . 
we should now be focusing our attention on giving a practical application to the decision that will be beneficial to all who are involved , to all the stakeholders in the industry . 
we have to do that through negotiation , which is where the government has fallen down . 
it waited until the decision came down before it looked at the prospect of negotiation despite the fact that Delgamuukw had talked about negotiation and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples had spoken about negotiation . 
i have heard a lot of goodwill spoken on this issue by people on all sides , by the aboriginal people and by non - aboriginal people who want to resolve this issue in a favourable way . 
this is where the minister and the government must take the lead and show leadership . 
they must not wait and see whether the negotiations have broken down . 
they must not wait and see if the traps have been pulled . 
rather , they must initiate leadership and do something now . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , the objective of asking the court to rehear the case is simply this . 
there is obviously turmoil on the east coast . 
people are upset because they are not sure what the decision means . 
they are not sure whether this priority right allows for others , non - aboriginals , to have access to the fisheries resource . 
we need clarification from the court . 
the rehearing is not to rehear the judgment . 
the court has spoken on that right . 
it has acknowledged that the treaty right exists . 
what it has not done is to clarify what right others have given this decision . 
we can argue this out until the cows come home but the quickest way to solve this problem is to go back to the court and ask it for clarification . 
what balance did the court have in mind when it allowed this treaty right ? 
was it going to allow that treaty right to be infringed ? 
the suggestion in Gladstone and in other cases is that yes , others have rights , but those rights are not stated in this case . 
in fact , the people affected by the decision were not represented in court . 
it is beyond me why the member would not want others to be heard by the court as well . 
the government did not represent the interests of existing commercial fishermen when it made that case in court . 
those people had a perfect right to be heard in that court . 
for the member from Halifax to suggest that they do not have a right to be heard in court is beyond me . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I have two quick questions for my friend . 
the first question is when we heard the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development make his intervention , he suggested that aboriginal people had been denied access to resources . 
my experience in British Columbia is that that is not the case . 
could the member elaborate on what the aboriginal participation is in the regular commercial fishery in British Columbia ? 
is this fishery a traditional fishery that existed prior to European contact and colonization ? 
was there a reliance on lobsters by the Mi ' kmaq Indians as a part of their culture and as a part of their subsistence prior to Europeans coming to North America ? 
Mr. John Cummins : 
some of the most prosperous fishermen in British Columbia were native Canadians . 
if we went to Prince Rupert in the member ' s riding of Skeena , 60 % of the people working in the fish canneries were natives . 
there was a high participation of native people in the fishery in British Columbia where the native population represents about 3 % of the population . 
with regard to native participation in the lobster fishery on the east coast , one circumstance that a historian described to me today was that fish were not mentioned in that treaty because they held very little value at the time the treaty was made . 
they were readily available to anybody who wanted them . 
if they wanted fish , it was not hard to catch them . 
as a trade item they had no value . 
certainly lobsters were probably not a commodity that was sought after by natives . 
there is no evidence to suggest that they were . 
as the member behind me said earlier , prior to 1968 anyone could have got a lobster licence . 
for a long period of time they were available to everybody for 25 cents . 
the people who participated in that fishery did so for a variety of reasons , but it was tough to make a living . 
since the restricted licences came in , the fishermen , the processors and DFO have worked hard together to put a quality product into the marketplace , a product which has gradually risen in value . 
now that it is a valuable fishery , obviously there is interest from others . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I wish to state at the outset that the aboriginal fishers and the commercial fishers on the east coast have my sympathies . 
i took the opportunity to tour . 
i went to Indian Brook , and this summer I went to Prince Edward Island to see the people on Lennox Island , the Micmacs . 
the native community , and the non - native community , shared a lot of visions on the sea . 
then there was the famous Marshall decision . 
unfortunately , I find that the government handled it very badly . 
if we look at the turn of events , what is occurring in the Atlantic provinces is not very happy . 
i decided to raise the issue of the vision of the treaties , because , as we recall , the supreme court analyzed the Murray treaty before making this decision . 
the native peoples viewed the treaties very differently from the Europeans . 
for them , the treaties were not just between governments , but between nations as well . 
what we can also see in history is that all of the people in an aboriginal nation felt bound by the treaty . 
whether it was an ordinary treaty , a friendship treaty or a treaty of co - operation , all of the members of the nation felt bound by it . 
i mentioned the example of the Micmac guardians of the treaty known as the Putu ' s . 
the guardians of these treaties , brought together the Micmac communities every year , reread the treaty and discussed it . 
we realize that the native view of the treaties is something both quite sacred and important . 
naturally , everyone knows , even if it is something rather folklorical for us , still it is a tradition that remains current . 
there were a lot of festivities when a treaty was signed : singing , dancing and so on . 
things were not the same for the Europeans . 
treaties were often signed by generals . 
this was the case with the treaty at issue , General Murray ' s treaty . 
no one knew the ins and outs of this treaty . 
they simply left it to the government or to the general signing the treaty and then forgot it . 
when the treaty became a bit of a bother , it was stuck away in the bottom of a closet and forgotten . 
this is the way the native people have always been treated . 
i would like to tell a story to explain what is going on in the Atlantic provinces . 
two hundred years ago , a neighbour of my family decided to put up a fence that took in 50 feet of my property , and things stayed that way ever after . 
each successive generation said it would straighten the matter out , reclaim our land and our jurisdiction . 
two hundred years later , the highest court in the land , the Supreme Court of Canada , decided that the fence was in the wrong place . 
how long will it take for the fence to be put back where it belongs ? 
no more than a day . 
it was no surprise that native fishers set out in their boats immediately after the decision , because they want to force the issue . 
they see that they have been left out in the cold and that it is very important that they get out quickly so as to perhaps force negotiations . 
unfortunately , negotiations are very slow in coming . 
i would not want to forget the Murray treaty , because I mentioned this famous general earlier . 
early in the 17 th century , there were a series of treaties in Virginia , Massachusetts and Pennsylvania . 
as I said earlier , the British crown drew up treaties with all aboriginal nations . 
there were treaties of this sort in Halifax in 1750 . 
grand chief Jean - Baptiste Cope , the aboriginal negotiator , concluded treaties . 
this was the dispute , according to the Marshall decision . 
nowadays , are aboriginal people allowed to trade a commercial fishery for goods or money ? 
that was for the Murray treaty . 
centuries have passed and a number of major events have occurred , including the Constitution Act of 1982 , which includes section 35 . 
that section , which was drafted after long battles by aboriginals , was included in the Constitution Act . 
so , this type of treaty was reconfirmed by the court which said " Yes , this is valid '' . 
in the current act , " aboriginal peoples of Canada " includes the Indian , Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada . 
this means that the Micmacs and Malecites meet the definition of aboriginal peoples and Indians . 
for greater certainty , in subsection ( 1 ) " treaty rights " includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired . 
this means that any land claim will now automatically be included and protected under the Constitution . 
i looked at how the jurisprudence has evolved over time , because I feel it is important . 
since this debate began , I have been hearing my colleagues commenting " We should go back to the supreme court in order to get it to specify what reasonable livelihood means ; we should go back to the supreme court and ask it to suspend its decision '' . 
since 1973 - I have gone back to 1973 but there are other earlier ones - aboriginal people have won just about all supreme court decisions . 
the first one I will refer to is Calder . 
six of the seven justices of the Supreme Court recognize the existence of ancestral title based on land occupancy Canada law . 
the justices acknowledge that aboriginal territorial rights exist not only by virtue of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 but also under Indian title as the result of ancestral occupancy . 
above and beyond the rights guaranteed by treaties or laws , aboriginal ancestral rights exist in Canada , that is to say customary rights that have survived colonization and the political transformation of the country . 
the year 1973 constituted a very significant breakthrough for aboriginal peoples before the supreme court . 
then in 1984 there was Gu é rin . 
in this case , the majority of the justices of the supreme court reaffirmed the existence of ancestral title and emphasized the federal government ' s fiduciary role . 
the Justices recognize that aboriginal ancestral rights existed before the British and Canadian regimes . 
thus , the rights existed even before the Europeans arrived here . 
the relationship between the Government of Canada and the aboriginal people is a fiduciary one and imposes real obligations on the federal authorities . 
note the wording " real obligations '' . 
then came the Simon case . 
the decision was as follows : 
the Supreme Court finds that native ancestral or treaty rights are not extinguished through the implicit effect of a statute . 
that means that the Parliament of Canada , even if it passes a law , cannot extinguish native rights . 
that is explained clearly in the decision in the Simon case , which dates back to 1985 . 
i am following a time line up to the present . 
members will realize that the solution is not necessarily a return to the supreme court . 
the Supreme Court recognizes the validity of the treaty signed by General Murray ... in favour of the Hurons - 
he had concluded an agreement with the Hurons on September 5 , 1760 . 
the Court recognizes that the consent of the native peoples is obligatory to the extinguishment of treaty rights . 
an ancestral or a treaty right may not be limited if public interest is served . 
now we come to the Sparrow case , which was pivotal to commercial and fishing activity in Canada . 
a lot of things were said in it : 
- provincial laws cannot limit an ancestral right , even if public interest is claimed . 
native fishing rights have absolute priority over others ' fishing rights . 
only the survival or the depletion of wildlife stocks may limit this right . 
i think that is currently recognized now . 
it goes on to say that , furthermore , an ancestral right cannot be interpreted so as to take in the particular regulation prior to 1982 . 
regulations that applied to one thing way back then could apply to something totally different today . 
that is the gist of the Marshall ruling . 
it says that there were trading posts at that time , and today native peoples are being given the right to engage in commercial fishing . 
this was the decision from which the case law evolved . 
it added that any government measure detrimental to the ancestral rights of native peoples must be justified explicitly and in a convincing manner . 
and the interpretation of treaties in particular must be generous and liberal . 
this means that when the supreme court judges look at a case , they are going to give the broadest possible interpretation to the words and provisions of the earlier decision . 
then there were the three famous decisions we often read about in the newspapers : 
Gladstone , Van der Peet , and Smokehouse . 
in Gladstone , the ancestral right to fish commercially was recognized . 
in Van der Peet and Smokehouse , the claimants had to show that their nation had already fished commercially in order to be granted the right to continue doing so , and failed to make their case . 
the Calder decision of 1996 recognized that the right to regulate for conservation still exists . 
the minister is therefore right in saying that regulating conservation is an important role he must play . 
finally , there was the Delgamuukw ruling , which is revolutionizing our approach to aboriginals . 
not only do we take into account the treaty , but also oral traditions . 
this means that someone appointed by his community could come before a court with oral traditions and say " I am in a position to demonstrate that we have always occupied that land '' . 
if the oral tradition is accepted by the court , it would be as powerful as the signature on a treaty . 
what I am trying to show is that the legal basis of the aboriginals is absolutely unshakable . 
whenever the minister of Indian affairs comes before the committee , once a year , I always make a point of asking him or her the following questions " When are you going to act regarding the aboriginal issue ? 
when will you stop waiting for the courts to rule on this issue ? " 
today , parliament is faced with a supreme court ruling , and it is always the same story . 
all these decisions have led to minor changes in the government ' s policy . 
there are 1,000 grey areas in the Indian Act . 
there are 1,000 grey areas in the treaties . 
and what does the government do ? 
it manages , but from one crisis to the next . 
since the crisis began on September 17 , the government ' s attitude has been " If we can manage to solve this crisis and get it over with , we will go back to our business '' . 
that has always been the problem . 
there will be other crises in natural resources . 
there will be other crises in forestry . 
there will be other crises regarding self - government , because of this government ' s total carelessness . 
it does not deal with the issue . 
the government begins discussions with various aboriginal groups and overlooks potential crises . 
instead of seeing what was up ahead , instead of saying " We will sit down and negotiate '' , the government says " We will wait for the court to decide and then we shall see '' . 
the Marshall decision recognized the rights of aboriginal fishers on the east coast and now we are stuck with having to make room for them . 
certainly , this upsets the old way of doing things . 
ingrained habits die hard . 
white fishers were not used to seeing other people allowed to enter their market , their fishery . 
someone is going to have to give in , and it is not the aboriginal people . 
frankly , we are not going to send out the RCMP to arrest them when they have a Supreme Court of Canada decision that says they are entitled to be there . 
the minister ought to settle this by negotiation . 
earlier , I received some most alarming news over the news wire . 
instead of the minister coming along with his colleague , the minister of Indian affairs , both of them proud as punch , to inform us that everything is just fine , that there are no problems , that now there is a moratorium , that the people will talk to each other , he should hop a plane this very night with his colleague , go down there to sit down and define what is a reasonable livelihood . 
that is what the Marshall decision is all about . 
in Marshall , it is stated that they are entitled to fish commercially for a reasonable livelihood . 
what does this mean ? 
as I said , the Bloc Quebecois will certainly not be in favour of going back to the supreme court to ask it to define " reasonable livelihood '' . 
is that minimum wage ? 
is it $ 100,000 a year ? 
this needs to be thoroughly discussed . 
these discussions should be held at the bargaining table . 
the definition of the suitable subsistence level must be negotiated , not determined by moratoriums that no one respects and by other interpretations that could be requested of the Supreme Court . 
i think historical errors have been made . 
for example , when the Fathers of Confederation signed the Constitution in 1867 , the native peoples were not represented . 
treaties have always been made for the benefit of the moment . 
when they were unfavourable , they were stuck in the closet . 
there is good reason why native peoples are reacting aggressively today . 
the government totally lacks courage , and shows a total lack of care . 
the Indian Act dates back 100 years , and the government is still trying to manage the aboriginal peoples with an act that is 100 years old . 
why does the government not speed up the issues of self - government and territorial claims ? 
so long as the native peoples lack the land and resources to be self - sufficient , we will go round in circles in this parliament , and the native peoples will react , especially since the supreme court decisions are in their favour . 
as I said earlier , the score is about 50 to nil in their favour . 
it seems to me there are things to be done . 
i say that Quebec ' s approach will be different . 
we want to avoid past errors . 
finally , I say to aboriginal people that Quebec will always abide by the treaties that were signed by the British crown . 
it goes without saying that we must maintain the same statutes and the same conditions . 
in fact , we will probably improve them . 
the James Bay agreement signed in May of 1975 is proof of that . 
the Quebec government has already said to the Cree " If you want to update the agreement , we are prepared to do so '' . 
i want to tell aboriginal people that the Bloc Quebecois will always support their efforts to gain greater autonomy . 
the Bloc Quebecois is probably the one party in this house that is best able to determine and appreciate what it means to strive to achieve greater autonomy . 
i want to tell aboriginal people that we are on their side in this endeavour . 
it is unfortunate that the minister is not here , and that the minister of Indian affairs is not here either . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
it is true that I am not allowed to say that . 
perhaps they are listening to me in the lobby . 
i have here with me the communique issued about an hour ago by all the chiefs on the east coast . 
i will read it in English . 
they say : 
we the chiefs wish to state that we are no longer asking our members to stop fishing . 
tomorrow morning there will be problems . 
that is why I told the minister to get on a plane this evening with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . 
they should go to the east coast . 
the chiefs have just said that the moratorium is over and that they will resume fishing tomorrow . 
their communique also states : 
this was released at 7.16 p.m. Here is proof of the government ' s negligence and carelessness , and we are paying the price . 
i suggest that they take a plane this evening and sort this out . 
the solution lies in negotiation , not in going back to the supreme court . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I thank my colleague for his comments . 
tomorrow morning , our communities will still be facing a crisis . 
tomorrow morning , children will go to school , and natives and non - natives will still be divided . 
unfortunately , the Liberal government has refused to show leadership and take action . 
it has left communities to fight it out , instead of stepping in , taking control , and sitting down and negotiating . 
it is very important to remember that what is involved here is not just a crisis in the lobster fishery . 
what my constituents are facing is a social crisis . 
we have worked very hard to get along , to work and eat together , and in less than two weeks , everything is being destroyed . 
i hope that the minister will take this into consideration and take action to ensure that we will be able to repair the damage to our communities . 
i wonder whether my Bloc Quebecois colleague would agree with me on this . 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
madam Speaker , I am totally in agreement with my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party . 
as I said at the start of my speech , I was in the aboriginal communities this summer and the summer before that . 
i noted a very fine social peace between aboriginals and non - aboriginals . 
the minister has stopped momentarily . 
i believe from the communique I have just received that it is absolutely urgent to negotiate . 
that is why I am suggesting that the minister take the plane tonight . 
if he is short domestic travel points , I would give him one , two even , if he wants to take his Indian affairs colleague to the east coast . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , would my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois not agree that because of the void in leadership in past Conservative governments and the current Liberal government the current government must allocate financial and human resources ? 
the real leadership in this crisis will come from the grassroots . 
the fishermen themselves and their communities will come up with short and long term solutions to the very serious crisis we now face in Atlantic Canada . 
would my hon. colleague not agree that the government must provide immediately the human and financial resources to help solve this problem ? 
Mr. Claude Bachand : 
madam Speaker , I totally agree that , the mess having been caused by the federal government , it is once again up to the federal government to go and clean it up . 
when I refer to cleaning up the mess , my colleague from Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madelein - Pabok will surely have suggestions shortly on how that can be done . 
for instance , buying back licences , something that is often done , so that more space can be made for the aboriginal fishers who have had the supreme court rule in their favour . 
now the government is going to have to roll up its sleeves and show some courage . 
the MESS is of its doing , as my colleague has said , the Progressive Conservatives as well . 
when the Bloc Quebecois is in a sovereign Quebec , I will always be able to support my NDP colleagues , for I find their positions very close to those of our party . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , every member of the House and every Canadian who has been following recent events in the east coast lobster fishery appreciates the fragile nature of the situation that has developed in the aftermath of the recent supreme court decision affirming treaty rights for Mi ' kmaq and for aboriginal people in Canada . 
confirmation within the last hour of the collapse of the voluntary moratorium is very worrisome . 
it underscores the importance for every member of the House to try to do everything humanly possible not to inflame the tension that has gripped communities in the east coast fisheries . 
i must say in that regard I find it frankly abhorrent to hear the intemperate , inflammatory and simply historically inaccurate references again and again by Reform Party members to a racially based fishery . 
that does nothing to help move us toward a solution which will ensure a sound , sustainable fishery for all those who deserve their fair share in the aboriginal and non - aboriginal communities of the east coast . 
there seems to have been very little appreciation of the enormous significance of these legal decisions , and I might say not only by the federal government but by the Government of Nova Scotia as well . 
if there had been , both levels of government would surely have been working together and working overtime with all the stakeholders affected to develop a plan which would be ready to be put in place when the supreme court brought down its decision on the Marshall case . 
instead what we have seen is paralysis and ineffectual action , in fact virtual inaction by the federal government . 
it is a response , incidentally , that is becoming all too frequent these days as Liberal lack of leadership in the agricultural and airline industry crises so sadly demonstrates . 
as I mentioned earlier in my throne speech remarks , that same lack of foresight was not displayed by the Mi ' kmaq leadership . 
as early as April 1999 the Mi ' kmaq implored governments to recognize , and I quote directly from a document dealing with the issue of the Mi ' kmaq fishery , that the impending decision from the Supreme Court of Canada in the Queen versus Donald Marshall , Jr. case had increased Mi ' kmaq expectations for greater access to the east coast fishery while at the same time creating uncertainty and anxiety within the existing industry . 
it is regrettable in the extreme the federal government did not have the foresight to at least take under serious advisement the urgings of the Mi ' kmaq leadership to anticipate the outcome of the decision . 
the Liberal government did nothing as it awaited the Marshall decision . 
its inaction allowed tensions and chaos to take hold in the Atlantic fishing communities . 
regrettably calm heads and voices were absent in the aftermath of the Marshall decision , precisely because the current fisheries minister and his predecessor had been conspicuously absent from this file prior to the supreme court decision . 
it is little wonder that lobster dependent coastal communities in Atlantic Canada have been wracked with tension and dissension in recent weeks . 
surely the answer is not to blame the supreme court for ruling on a treaty rights issue which was placed before it . 
nor is it acceptable , as the Prime Minister suggested , to stay the court ' s decision or , as some members in the debate keep insisting , to send the matter back to the supreme court . 
it is important for us to acknowledge that aboriginal people have been waiting for two and a half centuries for a ruling to clarify their rights of access to the fishery under existing treaties . 
a lack of preparation and foresight by the government is a lame and feeble excuse on which to criticize our highest court . 
talk about shooting the messenger . 
what is the right policy response to the challenges now confronting the lobster fishery and other commercial fisheries on the east coast ? 
Atlantic Canadians want and deserve a coherent answer to this question . 
they want to see a post - Marshall regime based on principles of fairness , equity , sustainability and long term commercial viability . 
in the wake of the Marshall decision , Atlantic Canadians want a fair , just and sustainable fishing arrangement . 
to achieve this end , those involved must be consulted and listened to . 
to arrive at a workable set of rules governing access to the resource we first need to consult those who are directly involved , to listen patiently and respectfully to all the stakeholders . 
without their insights , knowledge and at least tacit agreement we cannot proceed . 
permit me however to outline briefly some broad ideas which might inform that process and might form the basis of an acceptable solution . 
first , emphasis should be put on conservation , on preserving the long term health of the stocks . 
sound principles of management and conservation based on well grounded science must be implemented . 
Atlantic Canadians cannot afford another government induced collapse along the lines of the cod fishery fiasco . 
independent expert advice must be sought and must be heeded . 
second , we need to find a way to allocate licences to aboriginal Canadians so that they may enjoy legal and uncontested access to the resource . 
this may involve the government buying back some licences from commercial fishers . 
indications are that maybe 10 % of those who are currently fishing would welcome the opportunity to make way for aboriginals to make their rightful claim to their fair share of the fishery . 
let us be clear that we are talking here about those who would choose voluntarily to exit the lobster fishery at this point in their lives . 
it is absolutely critical to build consensus on a set of rules governing conservation , allowable catches and so on . 
a level playing field is the only way that we are likely to get buy - in from all groups concerned . 
third , we must work toward establishing community based fishery policies to replace the corporate industrial model which has enriched a few large companies at the expense of many independent inshore fishermen and their families . 
the unemployment , the poverty and the out - migration in many of these fishery communities is eloquent and distressing testimony to the failure of that approach . 
over the long term , we must work to establish fishing policies that are more community oriented than industry oriented . 
it is important to recognize that the modest entry of aboriginal fishers into this resource is not the reason various Atlantic fisheries are under threat . 
in my discussions with Mi ' kmaq representatives over the last week they have expressed what is understandably a great deal of distress and , I think it is fair to say , hurt at the implication that the problems caused to the fishing stock in the east coast are in any way attributable to their entry into the fishery . 
the real threat comes from the indiscriminate and unsustainable practices of corporate fish companies and multinational conglomerates . 
in my view the Leader of the Opposition was wrong today to condemn a communal approach to resource allocation as he did in respect of the Nisga ' a treaty . 
there is every reason to believe that increased meaningful local control and responsibility for the resource by fishing communities would generate rules that guarantee a reasonable livelihood for fishers , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , while preserving the future of the resource . 
to believe otherwise is to demonstrate a striking lack of faith in the decency , fairness and sense of responsibility of fishers . 
i pay tribute to the important and ongoing work of the joint working group on the Mi ' kmaq commercial fishery that was established in February of this year . 
let us hope that same careful , respectful , collaborative approach can get important progress back on track in moving us toward a solution by involving all stakeholders : aboriginal , non - native and government . 
that working group has been earnestly laying the groundwork for a viable commercial fishery that looks after the interests of all fishers , aboriginal and non - aboriginal alike . 
this kind of forward thinking is what we need from our leaders and decision makers at every level , and especially from the federal government where it has been so notably absent . 
let me conclude by saying that we need public policies to govern our fisheries and other resources that are grounded in long term thinking , in devolving decision making to those closest to the resource , and in a sense of fairness and respect for the livelihoods of all . 
the existing industrial factory style approach underwritten by bad science and greed has taken us to where we are today . 
let us turn this page and refashion the fishery and our other resource industries as well so they will be around to provide a decent livelihood for our children for many generations to come . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I have a question for the member whose comments were quite insightful on this whole issue . 
today in the House the minister was asked several questions . 
on a couple of occasions the minister said that today we should applaud those aboriginal leaders , 33 out of 35 , who on a voluntary basis decided to have a moratorium and not fish for 30 days . 
he went on further to say that was co - operation and dialogue and that they had a solution in place which was working because dialogue and co - operation was working . 
does the hon. member now begin to believe that in order to have dialogue and co - operation it takes two trusting parties ? 
in this case where the aboriginal leaders have absolutely no trust in the minister and no trust in the government , how then can we have co - operation and dialogue and therefore how can we have some kind of co - operation with the minister and the department to solve this very serious issue ? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
madam Speaker , I do not think it gets us to a solution to be stating absolutely that this problem cannot be solved because aboriginal and non - aboriginal fishers in Atlantic Canada do not have trust in the minister . 
it is absolutely true that fishers need to be able to build trust in the minister . 
they are shaken by the fact that it was not just this minister who has been very absent and in fact stayed completely out of the arena when there was an urgent need for immediate leadership in the aftermath of the Marshall decision . 
however , I think they are badly shaken by the fact that the federal government and the Conservative government before it showed so little respect for the issue of treaty rights that they basically were forcing people into the courts , turning their backs on the important principle laid out in the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples that we need to adopt an approach that says we negotiate , not litigate , these matters . 
there is a long legacy of this government and the previous government , not just the current minister , not showing appropriate respect for aboriginal Canadians , who now , understandably , want their fair share of the Atlantic fishery . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I want to state that the leader of the NDP in her speech did not offer any constructive or workable solutions , unlike Reform , which called for a stay and a rehearing of the judgment so that they could work it out and get it right instead of getting it wrong and then the government going in with all kinds of weaknesses trying to negotiate , let alone legislate , an end to this problem . 
i was interested in her comments that slammed large companies as causing widespread poverty in the region affected . 
i wonder how she squares that with union support for her party that thrives in large successful corporate environments . 
is she totally against the corporations that fish in that area for lobsters ? 
she would rather see them all go out of business I take it . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
madam Speaker , again , I do not think it is very helpful to make sweeping statements about anything so ridiculous as condemning all large companies . 
what we are talking about are fishing methods used by some of the large companies that virtually involve raping the ocean floor , ignoring the ecosystem , ignoring the food chain and ignoring the fact that if they are going to suck up everything that is in sight and throw fish overboard because they do not meet certain specifications what they will do is cause the kind of crisis that we now see in the east coast fishery . 
i do not think it takes us anywhere to go down that blind path of ridiculous conclusions . 
we need to look carefully at what kind of fishing practices are sustainable and what ones are not . 
for the benefit of all concerned , we need to adopt a regime of practices and regulations that will ensure a sustainable fishery over time . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , the leader of the New Democratic Party says we must try to develop a viable and sustainable fishing industry . 
could she give her opinion on the most recent international agreement that Canada signed this summer ? 
i am speaking of the UN fishing agreement . 
my problem here is that Canada must now deal with a requirement from the Supreme Court of Canada to the effect that we must guarantee adequate livelihood to aboriginal people . 
however , we still do not know what is meant by a cost - effective and , more importantly , a sustainable fishery , in the language and vocabulary used by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
sustainable has to do with the proposed fishing gear , but will it be viable ? 
what is the expected level of cost - effectiveness , particularly in the context being dictated at the UN by all the countries of the world , including France , the United States , England and so on , and without subsidy ? 
what will this " without subsidy " mean ? 
what do the words " viable " and " cost - effective " currently mean ? 
right now , we are asking Gasp é Peninsula fishers to share their resources with aboriginal people . 
if the court forces them to do it , they will do it , but they will also share their misery . 
in the wintertime , they have to rely on employment insurance . 
how are we going to define the terms " viable " and " cost - effective '' ? 
is the NDP prepared to team up with us to put pressure on the Liberal government to force them to develop that definition ? 
we need it not only to solve the aboriginal crisis , but also to ensure sustainability in the fisheries of eastern Canada . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough : 
Mr. Speaker , let me say first that I think the member who has raised the question would be the first to admit that the specific questions he raises are immensely complex , both in scientific and legal terms . 
however , I agree absolutely with the point of the member ' s question , which is that the federal government has to be prepared to allocate the appropriate resources to ensure that we come up with answers to those questions . 
the situation that the member describes in his own riding is one that is recognized by all of us who represent coastal communities . 
it is a matter of recognizing that solutions have to be local , regional , national and international . 
that is why it is so important that we have international fishery agreements such as the one that is under discussion . 
it is a complicated scientific and legal issue and it is incumbent upon all of us to put pressure on the federal government to allocate the appropriate resources and to give the kind of respect that is needed to local fishers being involved in helping to devise the scheme and the regime that will govern the current and future fishery and to ensure that it is sustainable . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise in the emergency debate on the native commercial fishery on the east coast . 
i will be sharing my time with my colleague for West Nova . 
i would like to thank our fisheries critic , the member for St. John ' s West , and our House leader , the member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , for tabling this debate and bringing it to the floor of the House of Commons . 
i tried several times to make a comment when the leader of the New Democratic Party was speaking . 
i will make that comment now because I am sure the member must think that this is a catch and release fishery . 
i would like to tell this House today that it is not a catch and release fishery . 
this is very real to the people in eastern Canada . 
this debate comes as the result of the implications of a September 17 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada recognizing the treaty rights of the Mi ' kmaq , Maliseet and Passamaquoddy people . 
the Marshall decision states : 
the 1760 treaty does affirm the rights of the Mi ' kmaq people to continue to provide for their own sustenance by taking the products of their hunting , fishing , and other gathering activities , and trading for what in 1760 was termed " necessaries '' . 
this right was always subject to regulation . 
this quote from the supreme court decision indicates that the impact of this decision could be far greater than simply fishing rights . 
all crown based resources in Atlantic Canada , including logging , fishing and possibly even sub - surface rights , may be affected by this decision . 
that is why it is imperative to have direction and leadership from the government on this issue , something that has been lacking so far . 
it has been 26 days since the supreme court decision and still the federal government does not have in place any sort of long term plan for regulating a sustainable fishery . 
the lack of leadership the government has shown on this issue , and therefore the lack of confidence both native and non - native communities have in the minister and his department , will only worsen if we do not hear something concrete from the minister soon . 
as it is , there has already been violence and near chaos in the fishery in Atlantic Canada . 
because the leadership has not been there to establish a clear plan for the future of the fishery this has occurred . 
i would like to take a moment to reference the speech made yesterday by the member for Windsor - St. 
in his comments on the throne speech he spoke well and he was extremely articulate . 
in fact , he was too articulate . 
he went on , and he went on , and he went on . 
i thought for a moment that his grandmother had mistakenly vaccinated him with a gramophone needle . 
i suspect that was not the case . 
i reference it only because the government has been very quick to pat itself on the back whenever the occasion arises and it can find all kinds of accolades to congratulate itself with . 
in comparison , I point out the lack of comments , speeches and leadership , and the lack of a plan of any type coming from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans before , during or after the September 17 decision of Regina v Marshall . 
it also needs to be mentioned that former Liberal cronies in the Nova Scotia government did not even see fit to represent the province of Nova Scotia as an intervenor in the supreme court case . 
indeed , it is not leadership from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans that has put in place the 30 day moratorium . 
instead , this was the result of consultations and agreement among 33 of the 35 chiefs of the assembly of Atlantic Mi ' kmaq chiefs who agreed to voluntarily suspend their fishing to allow all parities to reach a negotiated settlement . 
not the minister but the chiefs themselves put this in place . 
unfortunately , through continued government mismanagement and incompetence this is being rescinded . 
fisheries leaders have worked with native chiefs to find a way to recognize native treaty rights . 
the result had been this 30 day moratorium that should have given the government time to implement some plans and set in place guidelines and regulations for a long term , sustainable fishery , if we would have seen leadership . 
it comes back time and time again to leadership and the confidence in this minister and in the government . 
conservation and resource management are justification for such measures . 
all of these fishers fish under conservation . 
it is now the government ' s responsibility to ensure that conservation remains the priority of the department and that regulations are in place and enforced against everyone involved in the fishery . 
resource management is based on conservation and regulations . 
regulations were introduced back in the 1930 s and continued with trap limits , size restrictions , licences , seasons and lobster fishing areas . 
this and only this has preserved the resource . 
it is due to the fishers who have followed these regulations that we have the lucrative industry we have today . 
these rules apply evenly , whether they fish in Southwest Cove , Blandford , Indian Point , Port L ' Hebert , Port Mouton , Little Harbour , Barrington , Clark ' s Harbour , Woods Harbour , Shag Harbour or Lunenburg . 
every one of those licences I mentioned earlier is more than a licence . 
it also represents a family and in some cases two or more families . 
we all know where the Reform Party will stand on this issue . 
it will argue that the native fishery is a fishery based on race . 
we must make sure that we do not fall into its trap . 
there are answers , but inciting racism is not one of them . 
the minister still has an opportunity . 
it is still within his reach - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
order , please . 
i do not think it is appropriate , especially in light of the words of the hon. member for Halifax earlier , to ascribe inciting racism to any party or any members in the House . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
the minister still has an opportunity to reach a settlement with native and non - native fishers , but to do so he must show leadership . 
leadership requires taking a position and having a plan . 
the government did not have a plan A let alone a plan B . 
believe me when I say that this is only the tip of the iceberg . 
i mentioned earlier that Chief Justice Binnie stated in the Marshall case that the 1760 treaty right was always subject to regulation . 
this is not complicated . 
this right was always subject to regulation . 
fishery representatives have stated from the beginning that the industry can accommodate the gradual integration of first nations if they fish the same seasons and have the same licensing structure and same regulations as non - natives . 
we all know that because of the supreme court ruling we now have an important new player in the fishery . 
if the government had shown any leadership at all , we would not be in the situation we are in tonight . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the priority native commercial fishery mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall decision reflects precisely the separate native commercial fishery imposed on British Columbia fishermen by the previous Conservative government . 
the regulations the minister is imposing on the east coast fishermen to manage the fallout from this decision are precisely the regulations that were imposed on the fishery in British Columbia and which have taken that fishery from profitability prior to 1992 to the point this year where there is no fishery on the Fraser . 
why should I believe the crocodile tears that are coming from the member who just spoke when the policy of his party was precisely the same as the policy mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada ? 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , is the hon. member suggesting for a moment that we do not listen to the Supreme Court of Canada , that we are somehow above the law ? 
there was an opportunity all along . 
we were following this debate and the issue very closely . 
the government failed to show leadership . 
for the hon. member to raise questions and innuendo in the House on issues which he is obviously not cognizant of and for which he does not have the facts , including the aboriginal lobster fishery that existed previously , is a serious mistake . 
if we have leadership from the government we have an opportunity to bring an end to the problem in this fishery right now . 
it insisted that we could have a stay of proceedings . 
look where the stay of proceedings is right now . 
we are 72 hours from the end of this . 
the stay of proceedings will not happen . 
we went in the wrong direction with it . 
we should have had a moratorium in the beginning . 
that is the problem . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
i have spent an awful lot of time on the phone in the last few days talking to fishermen and representatives in the hon. member ' s riding . 
a lot of them have said that possibly for the short term in terms of a solution to incorporate the aboriginal people into the fishery is a sort of voluntary buy - back program . 
there are 6,300 licences in the maritime provinces right now that incorporate lobster fishing . 
of those , roughly 10 % belong to people who would voluntarily exit the industry if they got a decent price for their licences . 
would the hon. member not agree that could be a short term solution as we work toward a long term goal ? 
the government could purchase these licences , transfer them over to the Mi ' kmaw nation and everyone could fish under the same conservation guidelines . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the problem here is that the hon. member is mixing up short term and long term solutions . 
that could perhaps be part of a long term solution . 
it is a way to integrate the native fishery into the existing fishery . 
the bottom line for the fishery has to be very simple : a commercial fishery based on rules and regulations , the same seasons , the same trap limits and the same lobster fishing areas for everyone in the fishery . 
we can find ways and we can be innovative and we can bring the Mi ' kmaw fishers into the fishery , but we have to do it under one set of rules with one set of regulations for everyone in the fishery . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the supreme court rendered its decision on the Donald Marshall Jr. case on September 17 . 
almost a month has gone by and only now has the government recognized the seriousness of this particular ruling . 
tonight ' s emergency debate is focused primarily on the fishery and more specifically on the lucrative Atlantic lobster fishery . 
yet the supreme court ruling will have far greater implications for all future federal government negotiations with our aboriginal peoples . 
as my hon. colleague from south shore has mentioned , this ruling will most definitely be used as a benchmark for future discussions over such things as logging rights , mineral rights and even land claims . 
despite the importance of this decision , the government chose to postpone the opening of parliament by three weeks to introduce a new throne speech rather than reconvene parliament to address this situation . 
shame . 
after watching the aftermath of the supreme court decision , can there be any doubt that the government was totally and utterly ill prepared to respond to the violent reaction among fishers that such a decision was bound to create ? 
it is absolutely unbelievable that the government did not have a strategy prepared for whether or not the supreme court ruled in favour of Mr. Marshall . 
that was exactly what happened . 
instead of being a leader in this dispute , the minister has left it to the affected parties to come up with their own solutions to this impasse . 
native leaders have just come up with their own solution . 
following an emergency debate this afternoon , it was reported that native leaders have now decided to withdraw their support for a 30 day moratorium . 
this means that native fishers will once again take to the waters without any government restrictions . 
such action will certainly heighten tensions in an already hostile environment . 
native leaders are charging the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans with negotiating in bad faith by imposing trap limits on two native reserves in Burnt Church and Indian Brook who refused to enter into a moratorium agreement along with the 33 other band members . 
native leaders went to great pains to explain to the media that their original decision to agree to the moratorium was taken of their own accord and was not influenced by the request of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
it would appear as though they do not recognize the authority of the minister to impose a solution to this impending crisis in the fishery . 
and why should they ? 
the minister and his own senior officials have shown clearly that they have no solution to offer either native or non - native fishers with regard to this dispute . 
in light of the decision taken by native leaders today , it is vital that this minister and this government act immediately to establish at least a short term solution until a long term solution can be negotiated . 
what was this government thinking ? 
why was it so cocky that it could not even fathom the possibility of losing this case before the supreme court ? 
on what did it base this arrogance ? 
the rulings in these cases should have triggered some kind of warning bell within the government . 
let me ask the question millions of Canadians have been asking themselves , one that our party repeated in the House today . 
why was the government not prepared to respond to this situation ? 
why ? 
i have been in the House asking questions on the illegal lobster fishery that has been going on for the past two years . 
the minister and his officials knew that was happening . 
he cannot say that he did not know . 
he should have had a plan in place . 
it is not acceptable . 
our West Nova fishers perhaps are victims of their own success . 
not so many years ago a lobster fisher was said to be involved in a poor man ' s profession . 
there were virtually no markets for lobster . 
lobsters were used as fertilizers on our fields . 
the lucrative lobster industry did not just happen overnight . 
through conservation , dedication and a lot of hard work , industry leaders slowly began developing markets for this crustacean . 
we have gone from exporting lobster to the U.S. to opening lucrative markets in Europe . 
a lobster licence that may have sold for $ 5 30 years ago is now worth $ 250,000 in some cases . 
lobster fishers risk huge amounts of money to participate in this lucrative fishery . 
besides the expense of a fishing licence , investments include the purchase of a vessel , fishing traps , bait , fuel and wages for their employees . 
there is a huge overhead involved in this industry . 
so much money is tied up in their investment that any major decrease in catches or a significant reduction in the price received for lobster would be catastrophic for many fishers , particularly those who have just recently entered into the fishery . 
let us face it . 
the government was caught with its pants down by not having a strategy in place to address the supreme court ruling . 
rather than admit its lack of preparedness and thereby ask the supreme court to grant a temporary stay of its ruling until new regulations could be established , the minister simply allowed a free for all within the Atlantic fishery which led to fear and ultimately violence . 
this could all have been avoided had the minister of fisheries taken a leadership role in establishing temporary rules and regulations that would have encouraged dialogue leading to long term solutions . 
as tensions continued to rise , the minister kept telling Atlantic Canadians that he had the authority to impose restrictions based on conservation . 
i asked the minister why , if he were legitimately concerned with conservation , he would allow anyone , native or non - native , to fish out of season . 
the supreme court has rendered its decision . 
the native people ' s right to participate in the fishery has been upheld by Canada ' s highest court . 
however , the decision did not clearly define how the fishery was to be conducted . 
many non - native fishers are frustrated by the lack of leadership coming from the minister ' s office . 
the minister ' s initial reaction to the supreme court decision was to allow native fishers to participate in an unregulated , unrestricted fishery . 
naturally , tensions were bound to escalate as commercial fishers feared the potential loss of their livelihoods . 
the Atlantic fishery is worth over $ 1 billion to our economy . 
i would consider that quite significant , yet this government has responded with a casual air of indifference toward this crisis . 
the fishers of West Nova are some of the finest fishers in the world . 
although the minister and his government colleague appear ready to turn their respective backs on the industry , I want them to know that I will not . 
i will continue to demand from the government that we work with the stakeholders to come to an acceptable solution of this serious issue . 
on behalf of our fishers I implore that the minister begins addressing the issue immediately before the lobster industry is damaged beyond repair . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for West Nova for his remarks with regard to his fishermen . 
as I mentioned to his colleague from the south shore , I have been dealing exclusively with people in fishing and representatives in that area . 
the one thing I would like to add is that he is correct that we need immediate action from the minister . 
would he not agree that with the recent decision by the aboriginal chiefs in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to lift the moratorium it would be a very wise idea for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to get on an airplane and head down to that area to deal with the issue immediately ? 
Mr. Mark Muise : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for his question . 
i guess the answer is very obvious . 
i have been saying all along that the minister should have been on the ground in Atlantic Canada three weeks ago , the day after the decision happened , so he could get a sense of what was happening . 
i walked those streets for 42 years and I have never , ever sensed the tension that is in my part of the province . 
the hon. member for South Shore and my colleagues from New Brunswick tell me the same . 
the ministers should be on the ground . 
they should be talking to be people who have a chance of resolving the problem . 
they should show leadership and they should be there immediately to start working on it right away . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I cannot help but comment on the last remarks of the hon. member . 
the tensions and whatnot that he is describing , the fears and the hurts that people are relating to him , are the same problems that we have been listening to for the last six or seven years in British Columbia . 
they are problems that were brought on by the policy of the former Conservative government . 
that has been our proposed solution . 
i am still curious as to why the suggestion I made that a stay of judgment and a rehearing of the case be sought is rejected by my friend who just spoke . 
the facts are clear that the moratorium will not work . 
it would give voice to those people who are affected by the decision . 
i would like to know why they reject that notion . 
Mr. Mark Muise : 
Mr. Speaker , I am always impressed or not impressed by my hon. colleague ' s inflammatory remarks . 
it is by working together in trying to come to a solution that we can achieve peace and some kind of acceptable solution of the matter . 
it is not by driving a wedge between both parties or using derogatory or inflammatory comments that we will come to a solution . 
we have to represent our people . 
once the court has made a decision it cannot be reheard . 
there is no room for appeal or there is no ability to appeal a supreme court decision . 
we have to work together instead of trying to drive a wedge , which my hon. colleague seems to be doing so well . 
i will have no part of that . 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) : 
they have no resource sharing revenue mechanisms to have returns of revenues to them . 
at this point in time in our history aboriginal people are saying that they want equity of access . 
we want to be self - sustaining communities and we want to participate . 
quite clearly , to put this debate in context , we must understand that aboriginal people and non - aboriginal people have to work hard to allow cooler heads to prevail , to be reasoned and logical , and to try to find constructive solutions . 
in dealing with the debate and trying to help clarify the government ' s position on the Marshall decision , I am extremely impressed with my colleague , the minister of fisheries , who very appropriately went to the aboriginal people and the commercial fishery in the Atlantic region to deal with the problem . 
it was very skilfully done . 
the level of arbitration and consultation had proven results . 
we have to work not only at dealing with an interim crisis but at a long term and strategic solution for it . 
some critics even suggest we simply put down our fist and simply close the lobster fishery indefinitely . 
closing the fishery would have been in some respects an easy way out but would have been unproductive for all parties . 
the supreme court decision , my colleagues across the way should know , is the highest legal voice in the land and we must respect its rulings . 
we cannot cherry pick on a decision that the supreme court makes when we feel that we do not like it or other people do not like it . 
what kind of a country would we have ? 
what would happen to the charter of rights under those conditions ? 
just as important , the court also said the right could be regulated . 
i am sure some people who want to inflame and create fear unnecessarily would have us believe that there would be anarchy on the seas , that native people would go out there indiscriminately after decades and years of depending on country foods and on the fishery for sustainability . 
that they would go out there and pillage is ludicrous . 
as we can see , the judgment is complex and there are still a number of issues to be resolved . 
the minister immediately sought clarification of the ruling to provide the best possible response in the shortest period of time . 
this analysis took less than two weeks when many other cases have required months . 
we have heard in the House of Commons today a reference to what the opposition considers the fact , that this is a race based right . 
it is very important to understand that the collective rights of aboriginal people are not race based . 
those comments are race based . 
the collective rights of aboriginal peoples are human rights that accrue to them by virtue of their existence as people with their own cultural , legal and political traditions . 
aboriginal peoples have welcomed others to this land and have asked only for a reasonable accommodation of their fundamental human rights as individuals and as people . 
with our particular brand of Canadian ingenuity we as Canadians have inherited and built upon a constitution that seeks accommodation between those people that were here and experienced colonization and all those that have come afterward . 
the Mi ' kmaq of the maritimes have waited 240 years to have their fundamental rights respected under a treaty entered with the crown , a treaty that is part of the constitutional fabric of the country . 
the Mi ' kmaq like other aboriginal people have been asked to respect the rule of law and they have done so by taking their claims to the courts . 
i cannot express strongly enough my belief that Canadians of all origins are by nature a generous and accommodating people who respect the rule of law . 
i have no doubt that we will continue to prove ourselves to be so in the future , but the will and the spirit to co - operate has to be there . 
we cannot achieve that level of accommodation if we create fear in the public . 
it is our responsibility to instil hope . 
it is our responsibility to be responsible in what we say to the public . 
if we inflame with those kinds of comments we are doing nothing to resolve the issue . 
it is important for the House to know the roles the minister of fisheries has played . 
instead of closing the fishery , as I mentioned earlier , the minister took the harder road of negotiations . 
the minister and the government wanted to respect the supreme court ruling . 
there were other suggestions that were not taken up for obvious reasons . 
where others might have given up the minister continues to seek solutions through dialogue and co - operation . 
the minister continues to be involved on a daily basis . 
he is in constant touch with the aboriginal leaders , the commercial fishery , government officials and Atlantic premiers . 
early on the Marshall decision was a prominent issue when the Atlantic Council of Fisheries Ministers met in Quebec City last month . 
there was a clear recognition from all jurisdictions of the need to clarify the implication of the court decision and to put in place a management regime . 
the council recommended that regime must ensure the conservation objectives are not compromised and be fair to other interests in the fisheries . 
we can do that and that is about economic preservation . 
major investments have been made by the commercial fishermen out there . 
it is a major investment . 
that is another thing to think about . 
however it is quite interesting if put it into the proper context . 
on district 23 in the Burnt Church area of Miramichi Bay the number of lobster trapped used by aboriginal people adds up to less than 1 % of the number of traps used by the non - commercial fishery . 
is that a conservation crime ? 
is that something that at this point we will have to be totally unreasonable about ? 
it is something we should think about . 
we have to put everything in context . 
i agree that we should be looking at finding a solution . 
we all witnessed the unfortunate incidents in the days following the court . 
in conclusion , we have to work hard . 
as I said in the beginning , closing the fishery would have been the easy solution , the quick fix . 
but there is no quick fix on an issue that affects people ' s rights , lives and livelihoods . 
i am confident that the minister ' s staff and department will continue working in the right direction to better the lives of everyone involved . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the hon. member for her remarks . 
they were very insightful , passionate and sincere . 
i could not agree more with the need for reasoned and moderate debate . 
however , along that line I would ask the hon. member , in all sincerity , that if this was the true intention , why did her government , three days after the Marshall decision was handed down , decide to prorogue parliament , thus hamstringing and in no small way completely doing away with the ability to debate this issue in the House of Commons ? 
it was the Progressive Conservative Party that had to call for this debate . 
it was not done voluntarily by the government . 
if that is the case and if debate is what will lead to a solution - and I agree with the member that it will - why did her government do away with that ability by proroguing this House ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the issue on proroguing the House is a red herring . 
it is irrelevant to the very important issue at hand . 
we had a lot of things to consider . 
there were a number of requirements that had to be met . 
we were preparing for a throne speech and the installation of a new governor general . 
those are not excuses ; those are reasons . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like my hon. colleague opposite to repeat part of her speech . 
i want to be absolutely sure that I understood the interpreter . 
one percent is nothing . 
that is the problem . 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew : 
Mr. Speaker , I would never consider contradicting the minister . 
the minister indicated that conservation is important , and it is an important issue , not just for the fisheries but for every resource . 
that is an important issue and it is a general statement . 
we can assume whatever we want , but what I went on to say was that there are other considerations besides conservation . 
conservation is always important when we are dealing with a resource , but there is also economic preservation . 
that was the point I was making . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have great respect for the hon. member and the area from which she comes . 
if the member believes that this minister is doing such a fine job , then would she not try to convince her minister , because the people ' s perception of politics is their reality , and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to get out of Ottawa , to get down to the maritime region and to deal with this issue firsthand , instead of dealing with it by long distance from Ottawa ? 
would the member not make that suggestion to her minister and make it an imperative motion for him to get down there immediately to deal with this issue ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew : 
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague knows that this is important to the minister . 
i also know that the minister has a great deal of respect for members of the House and would want to be here to respond to their questions as he did today in question period . 
he would want to be here to respond to those members who represent the people in the area , and he has been dealing with those people continuously . 
that is not an issue . 
the minister has demonstrated quite clearly that he is capable , committed and has the confidence to do the job . 
Mr. Charles Hubbard ( Miramichi , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Miramichi , as the hon. member opposite noted , is where Burnt Church is , where Red Bank is and where Eel Ground is , three of the reserves that I represent in the House . 
listening to some of the debate tonight I wonder how well some of our native people are being represented in the House . 
across this country there are nearly one million status and non - status people who were the original people of this country . 
i take affront with some of the statements made in the House in terms of the rights those native people have and should have under the agreements our ancestors made with them . 
i also have a very valuable industry in my constituency , which is fishing . 
tonight we are talking about lobsters , but in terms of the fishery it is a much broader issue than just lobsters . 
lobsters over the last 40 to 50 years have become one of our most valuable species , along with our snow crabs . 
those two species provide a lot of income to the people along the Baie de Chaleurs and Miramichi Bay areas . 
we also have to recognize what happened and be very aware of the situation that developed which pitted one group of people against another group , the commercial fishermen . 
i would like to point out to the House that some commercial fishermen are natives . 
the aboriginal fishery strategy over the past decade has offered fishing licences and in fact the Burnt Church reserve has approximately 10 licences . 
it is the same with the reserve at Big Cove where they have fishing licences and also with Indian Island . 
it was a very unfortunate incident that happened on that Sunday some weeks ago when fishermen decided to take the law into their own hands . 
there was a certain degree of frustration because they saw , in terms of the supreme court ruling , that their industry and their livelihood was at stake . 
i met with some of those fishermen . 
they came to my office in great numbers on the Wednesday prior to the incident that happened on Sunday . 
it seems that there were other people who came into our area . 
there were lobster boats and commercial boats that came from outside the Miramichi constituency to fish on the shores of Burnt Church . 
we have to recognize the value of conservation . 
the inner Miramichi Bay in the fall of the year has very warm water . 
the lobsters come to change their shells , to moult . 
it is a nursery where the lobsters procreate and develop for the next season ahead . 
with that , the commercial fishermen saw a danger to their industry . 
we also have to recognize that for the native people of Atlantic Canada the treaty rights they obtained as a result of the Marshall decision created a great period of exhilaration , a great victory they had won , a point they had been striving for and reaching for over many years . 
many of the native people took to the shores to set their pots and fishing traps to see what lobsters they could obtain . 
we talk of this in terms of wisdom . 
many of us are pointing at certain people who have made mistakes . 
i would like to point out , Mr. Speaker , that when I point at you with one finger , I am actually pointing back at myself with my other three . 
i think a lot of us in the House tonight , as we try to find some villain in this , are actually doing three times as much damage to ourselves as we are to the people we are pointing toward . 
some will criticize the supreme court . 
they feel that the supreme court did not have enough wisdom in terms of the outcome of the decision it rendered . 
the court might have stated in its own behalf that it recognized rural Canada and especially the Atlantic provinces if it had foreseen the difficulties , but that wisdom was not seen by the supreme court . 
some will criticize the minister , but the minister has to look at those judgments . 
he and his staff and the Department of Justice have to decide just what is said in those pages that have been written by the justices . 
it takes some time for that to be brought to light and for the proper decisions to be made . 
some will criticize the fishermen who were taken back by the decision . 
they were very much concerned that an immediate process should evolve and that the minister should simply say " no native fishermen '' . 
that would not be a wise decision . 
the native people have as much right to the resources of the country as anyone else . 
in terms of perspective , we must mention that the fishery has grown over the years . 
in the 1960 s a commercial lobster licence could be obtained for about 25 cents . 
today licences are worth somewhere between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 . 
we also have to recognize that over the years the lobster industry has been developed . 
i read an article some years ago about teachers being sought in the southern part of New Brunswick . 
at that time , during the great depression , teachers often boarded with parents in the community . 
one promise that one school board made in southern New Brunswick was that no one boarding at their house would have to eat lobsters more than twice a week . 
lobsters were frowned upon in terms of being a commodity and only poor people ate lobsters . 
today , of course , such is not the case . 
we have to recognize that in Atlantic Canada the fishery has been developed . 
the various species all have different values . 
we talk about smelts , clams , oysters and the list goes on . 
in fact , the Marshall case dealt with eels . 
the fact is that all of them will have to eventually be translated into accommodations in terms of how native and non - native fishermen will approach the fishery . 
the point is that not only have native people been restricted in terms of the fishery ; the people on the west coast talk about the public right to fish . 
on the Atlantic side we do not have the public right to fish . 
fishing has been closely regulated and people have obtained fishing licences as a result of having paid fees over the years which have been applied by certain regulations . 
i hope that in some way this matter can be resolved . 
in the Miramichi constituency we have people with fear . 
people are afraid that others may infringe on their rights . 
we have had burnings , we have had trucks destroyed . 
there was a special healing site that the native people in Burnt Church burned by fire . 
a house has been destroyed . 
all of those things have created great problems in our community . 
with it , people who have lived side by side for some 200 years are suddenly no longer great friends . 
i hope that in the debate tonight we can bring some reason to this problem that has been created in the Atlantic fishery , that people can restore some faith in their ability to relate and understand other people and that , above all , in the near future we can develop a fishery which can accommodate people , both native and non - native , and that the fishery can work in the best interests of the economy of Atlantic Canada . 
i also wish to point out one final point . 
burnt Church is a very isolated reserve . 
it consists of between 900 and 1,100 people , depending upon the season . 
the people of Burnt Church have great economic needs . 
i think that is true of a great number of reserves across the country . 
there are some 600 of them . 
many of them lack the economic resources to develop their own people and to provide a livelihood for their children . 
let us put all of that into perspective and hope that we as Canadians and as parliamentarians can join together to see a resolution to this great problem that will accommodate most of our people . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it was suggested that returning to court for a stay of judgment and a rehearing was cherry picking . 
it is not the case . 
the purpose of returning to court would be to avoid the type of confrontation we have seen and to seek a clarification of the court ' s intent in this decision . 
for example , would they permit an infringement of the treaty right that they recommended ? 
i refer to paragraph 75 of the Gladstone decision where the court itself recognized that others had acquired rights to fish . 
it said that reconciliation of aboriginal societies with the rest of Canadian society may well depend on achieving that balance . 
does the member opposite not see a value in returning to the court and getting the court ' s opinion on how these conflicting rights could be adequately addressed ? 
Mr. Charles Hubbard : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not a lawyer and I certainly have to take under advisement what the hon. member has asked . 
the conclusion I come to is that since the early 1980 s we have brought the Constitution home and the supreme court is the supreme court . 
certainly the Department of Justice may work out with members of the court an interpretation of some of their statements in terms of that judgment , but we cannot turn our backs on a supreme court decision . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask a question of my colleague from the riding of Miramichi , which is adjacent to the riding of Acadie - Bathurst . 
i sympathize with the problems in his riding , but they are the same as in my riding . 
my colleague told us that fishers went to see him in his office on Wednesday , and all the problems occurred on Sunday . 
then we learned that the minister went there two weeks later . 
i would like my colleague to comment on this situation . 
is he disappointed with his minister ' s attitude or does he approve of the minister ' s slowness in handling this whole issue ? 
there is a crisis in our region , and we must take action . 
i think the minister should not even be here tonight . 
he should be in Atlantic Canada trying to solve the problems of native and non - native fishers . 
Mr. Charles Hubbard : 
Mr. Speaker , in New Jersey on Thursday of last week I met with a number of people and I visited the Burnt Church reserve a short time later . 
i made a statement that generally all people are good people but there are people in every group who want to create major problems . 
i know that in terms of what happened there , we were unfortunate to have outsiders come to Burnt Church . 
it was also unfortunate that some of the fishermen did what they did . 
on the afternoon in question , members of the MFU and I spoke with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i called him on the phone and he was readily available . 
that the boats came from outside the constituency on the weekend certainly was a major factor . 
from that , the Sunday morning episode resulted and then the Sunday night episode shortly after I visited . 
i was down there that evening from about 6.30 to 7 p.m. and shortly toward dark those vehicles were destroyed . 
it is a very unfortunate thing , but the point is that it happened and we all have to live with it . 
hopefully the minister in the fine efforts he made in the week since has brought some resolution to it . 
he has met with the 30 chiefs . 
he certainly had great courage in doing so and I want to commend him for it . 
he met with the MFU and hopefully we can resolve this . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , native communities , like many non - native communities , are in some economic difficulties . 
the hon. member for Miramichi mentioned that . 
there are a lot of native communities in difficulties . 
that is why it is so important now that there is an opportunity for them to have some work in the fishing industry we make sure that 10 years from now there are still lobster out there . 
that is going to benefit both communities . 
would the hon. member agree that we could have seen more leadership on the part of his government , because conservation is the solution to this ? 
we have to get around the table . 
it is very clear that conservation is what - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. member for Miramichi has 30 seconds , please . 
Mr. Charles Hubbard : 
Mr. Speaker , the leadership was very evident . 
i was satisfied with the leadership the minister provided . 
i am glad to see the hon. member opposite , who has a very large native community of her own , speaking up for them and representing them in the House . 
i thank her for that . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to engage in the debate this evening . 
i would like to start by focusing my remarks on the supreme court . 
i do not doubt for one moment its sincerity . 
i do not doubt for one moment its character or the integrity of the nine justices who sit on the supreme court , as I do not doubt the integrity and the character of members opposite and of members in other political parties who hold different views than I do on this issue . 
i would hope that members opposite would refrain from attacking the character and motives of people in this party every time the Reform Party disagrees with them on a philosophical basis on issues that are so fundamentally important to the future of Canada . 
in saying that , I want to focus on the supreme court . 
many people and many members in the House look at the Supreme Court of Canada in awe . 
they somehow see these nine justices as being virtually infallible and that somehow we have to accept anything handed down from the supreme court as being the final word . 
it is as if these people were anointed or appointed by some higher being , by some deity that is unknown to us . 
the fact is that the nine justices on the supreme court were all appointed by partisan prime ministers , either Conservative or Liberal . 
over the past 30 or 40 years all the existing justices on the supreme court have received their elevation to the bench in that manner . 
while I would never want to accuse any of the justices on the supreme court of being partisan , it is important to note that I recognize that they are appointed within a certain milieu , a certain political prevailing philosophy . 
for about three decades or more that certain political prevailing philosophy can be characterized in several different ways . 
we could call it more and more the posture of the politically correct . 
we could call it progressive enlightened thinking . 
or , let me borrow from Thomas Sowell , the great American writer who said in his excellent book The Vision of the Anointed that these people have become enraptured with a certain vision that is predominantly a Liberal left vision . 
the philosophy of that is so evident in our political , social and academic institutions . 
it has become progressively more so over the last three or four decades . 
we are not saying that these are bad people . 
we are not saying that their characters are flawed . 
we are not saying that they ought to be harshly rebuked and criticized for the views they hold . 
what we do say is that they are fundamentally wrong in their thinking . 
that is the problem we have with this issue today . 
the people who embrace this vision of the anointed , again to borrow from Thomas Sowell , assume their own moral superiority because they are convinced of the rightness of their cause . 
therefore , they believe they are somehow morally on a higher plane than anybody else . 
they believe that anybody who disagrees is not only morally wrong , but is in sin . 
we can see the evidence of that in the debate in this chamber from time to time . 
also , these people who are ensconced in this vision of the anointed also tend to insulate themselves from the reality of the impacts of their own decisions . 
they do not want to see the reality of the decisions they make . 
when they make a decision and feedback comes back to them that somehow something has really gone wrong , they point their fingers at anyone and everyone and any other thing they can possibly dream up rather than seriously examine from an intellectually honest point of view their own positions and decisions to see how they affected the outcomes that they do not really want to see . 
i submit that the Supreme Court of Canada is very much caught up in this vision of the anointed . 
the political institutions of this country , the Liberal Party in particular , are also very much caught up in this vision of the anointed . 
what we have is a people who fervently believe that they can right the wrongs of history by ignoring the lessons of history . 
they do not want to give any regard to history ' s lessons . 
they do not want to give regard to basic democratic principles and values . 
they think they can ignore basic democratic principles and values and that because they are somehow more clever , gifted or more able , they can concoct some kind of new societal arrangement that will be successful while ignoring those principles . 
i submit that 10,000 years of human history has proven that cannot be achieved . 
without democracy we return to the barbarism that all our ancestors experienced in the past . 
regardless of who we are in this House , that is where we came from . 
we learned that through 10,000 years of recorded human history . 
we learned from experience . 
we learned by trial and error and many different kinds of societal arrangements that the best way to arrange our affairs so that we can have peace , harmony , prosperity and human rights is through basic democratic institutions . 
the cornerstone or founding principle of democracy is the equality of all people before the law . 
we cannot have it any other way . 
we cannot be so smart , egotistical or arrogant as to believe we can somehow rearrange society and give special status and rights to be assigned on whatever basis , blindly ignoring the lessons of history and basic democratic principles and expect that we will have peace and harmony in society . 
i submit that the evidence of that is before us today . 
we have had three or four decades of successive policies emanating from government that have tried to encourage Canadians , aboriginal Canadians in particular , that this somehow can happen and that it somehow can work . 
not just in the case of the east coast lobster fishery but right across the country we are seeing more and more evidence that not only does it not work but it is leading to real conflict and disharmony in our society . 
it is not healthy . 
i do not doubt the sincerity of the justices on the supreme court and that they were trying to do the right thing . 
i question how they could come up with the decision they did when the treaty of 1760 on which they relied to render this decision does not even mention fish . 
clearly what they were trying to do was right the wrongs of history by reading into this treaty things that were not there and trying to create some kind of different societal structure that would in their view be a benefit to the Mi ' kmaq people . 
as much as there are people in the east coast lobster fishery right now who are being displaced and are hurting financially and will continue to hurt financially until this issue is resolved , the people who will pay the biggest price for this folly before it is all said and done will be the Mi ' kmaq people themselves . 
i will say it again for anybody in the House who cares to listen . 
the people who will pay the biggest price before it is all said and done will be the Mi ' kmaq people themselves . 
unless the government can demonstrate leadership on this and can break with its failed vision of the past and embrace the genuine basic principles of democracy and encourage our aboriginal brothers and sisters to do the same , we will be in real trouble . 
we can see it coming everywhere . 
i take absolutely no pleasure in saying this but it is coming . 
it can be seen everywhere : the Musqueam in Vancouver , the east coast lobster fishery , in Manitoba and in Northern B.C. 
talk about encouraging aboriginal people in the wrong direction . 
i would wager that the sons and daughters of members in this place are not trying to forge a future for themselves in a fishery somewhere . 
the resource industries in Canada are mature to say the least and some of them are over mature as my colleague from Delta pointed out . 
some of these are declining industries . 
the people who are in the fishery right now are there because they have a historical attachment to it . 
they have a history with it and are earning a living right now . 
what we are telling all other Canadians is that they should get into the information age and the technological age and think about the future in terms of global trade and global economies . 
we then turn to the aboriginal people and tell them to think of the future in terms of the fishery and logging , in terms of resource extraction and those industries that are already mature in Canada . 
it is only within democratic institutions that the value and worth of the ordinary individual is found . 
when we get into assigning rights and status on the basis of anything other than individual equality , we end up going backward in time . 
we end up building walls rather than bridges and we end up creating real conflict in society over time . 
the supreme court and the democratic institutions of the country genuinely believe they can achieve what human beings have never been able to achieve in the past 10,000 years . 
the evidence that they cannot is before us today . 
the Marshall decision from the supreme court should be a real wake - up call for everyone who is considering what the Nisga ' a agreement means . 
the treaty I am talking about in this instance is a very thin document . 
the Nisga ' a treaty is 200 pages long with 400 pages of appendices and 50 or so agreements that have yet to be negotiated and do not even fall within the agreement as it exists today . 
each one of those conditions is subject to a supreme court decision at some point in the future . 
consider what that might mean for our country . 
the people who have negotiated these treaties have no idea . 
when we suggested in the spring that they submit that treaty to the supreme court for a reference so we could find out what the supreme court ' s view would be on the application of the charter of rights and freedoms and what the supreme court ' s view would be with respect to the constitutionality of that agreement , those people were so arrogant and so sure of themselves , again assuming their own moral superiority , that they looked at us , tried to mischaracterize what we were saying and ignored the warnings we were trying to give them . 
we have been trying to give these warnings for six years in this place . 
we have been trying for six years to say , " hold on , we think you ' d better think this through again . 
i would argue that the empirical evidence supports us . 
the empirical evidence supports exactly what the Reform Party of Canada has been saying since its inception . 
when we break away from the equality of all Canadians , when we start assigning special status or special rights or special access to resources , when we start assigning different rights to people on any basis , we have a recipe for disaster . 
we have a recipe for disaster on the east coast of Canada right now . 
i do not know what the answer is but I do know how we got here . 
i know the government needs to take leadership . 
it needs to demonstrate that it has the ability to lead and to govern for peace , order and good government which it fails to do . 
it routinely allows decisions to be made by the supreme court so it can duck the responsibility and the potential follow up for making those decisions itself . 
that is why we are in the predicament we are in today . 
i submit that there are people in the federal government and the justice department who are constitutional and legal experts . 
there has to be ways of dealing with this issue that will be fair , affordable and lead to a resolve of the issue . 
the very first responsibility of this government or any federal government has to be to reach out to those aboriginal people who are caught betwixt and between and tell them that their existence with special status has never been of any benefit to them at all . 
we need to rethink the relationship between the aboriginal people and the Government of Canada and the rest of Canada . 
obviously the existing relationship has not worked to the benefit of aboriginal people and has not worked to the benefit of Canada . 
it is time that we broke from the failed thinking and failed policies of the past and came up with some new ideas , some new visions and some new ways to move forward . 
if we do not do that , I fear that we are in for more conflict , more unrest and more of these kinds of events that have been occurring on the east coast of Canada . 
i do believe that there is a potential for that if this government does not demonstrate that it has the ability to lead and the ability to change its thinking on these fundamental issues . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can see that many members want to put questions , so I would like to give the hon. member for Skeena the opportunity to speak while the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Indian Affairs are here , by asking him the following question . 
since the House of Commons has recognized the need to hold , on this very first day of the session , after the government has prorogued Parliament , an emergency debate on the fishery crisis and the Marshall judgment , would it not have been important for the government to immediately re - establish both the standing committees on aboriginal affairs and fisheries , so that we could find out who would be representing the government on these committees ? 
some members have told us tonight " We are not lawyers nor constitutional law experts '' . 
this committee would have had the opportunity and the money to examine the ins and outs of this issue and help us make a more informed decision on what is happening here . 
i have the feeling that the government , just like the minister who would like us to believe that he is doing something , would have us go round in circles . 
i would remind the House that we do not even have the right to vote on the issue being debated here tonight . 
in the end , I feel like I may be losing my time here , when there are things to be negotiated . 
in the meantime , to be able to inform the people we represent , we should have access to correct and relevant information . 
i would like to know if my hon. colleague from Skeena is as eager as I am to find out the truth and to see if the government is indeed out of money . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly appreciate my friend ' s question . 
we have sat on the fisheries committee together in the past and I have appreciated his contribution . 
i think the member would agree with me , since we have both sat on committees for a number of years now , in some cases together and in some cases apart , that the Liberal government is not fundamentally interested in having committees decide anything . 
it does not really want the committees to get into these issues and examine them because the committee might make some recommendations that it would not want to have to deal with . 
i am sure the hon. member would tend to agree with me that the government really does not know how to deal with the issue in front of it right now . 
it is almost like somebody rolled a grenade into the room . 
the government does not know how to deal with it but it certainly does not want to allow any other body other than itself to come up with the final decision on it . 
part of the problem with our parliamentary system is that it is just not functioning the way it is supposed to . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the comments of the member for Skeena and the fact that he believes there are enough constitutional lawyers , enough legal opinions and enough bureaucrats in Ottawa to help find some sort of solution to this problem . 
would the member not agree with me that the real solution to this issue probably lies in the fishermen themselves and in the coastal communities of Atlantic Canada ? 
in the last 26 days that this decision has been rendered , we have heard time and time again that the aboriginal people and non - aboriginal people have been getting together to come up with short term and then long term solutions for the long term viability and conservation minded aspects of the fishery . 
the problem of course is that the government is not giving any human or financial resources to aid those people in their consultations . 
would the member not agree that a better solution to this would be from the ground up instead of the top down ? 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , I would have to agree with my friend that in most cases bottom up solutions are better . 
being a member of a populace party , we certainly believe in populism and in grassroots democracy . 
i would like to think that there is hope for a resolution along those lines and maybe there will be . 
i am not saying there will not . 
far be it for me to throw cold water on that idea . 
obviously something has to be done . 
what we have right now are two fundamentally competing interests . 
human nature being what it is , it is going to be very difficult to reconcile those competing interests . 
whether it can be done from the bottom up or not remains to be seen . 
hopefully there is some goodwill on both sides . 
hopefully there is an attempt being made as we speak to reconcile and to move forward in some spirit of cooperation . 
i am not saying it cannot happen . 
i am just saying that I am not holding my breath . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our national anthem states that this is our home and native land . 
all of a sudden one segment of society feels like it has a second class citizenship , that their citizenship is not a full citizenship anymore and we have bad relations all of a sudden . 
my hon. colleague has commented on the bad situation that is occurring . 
before I ask him to comment further on that , I would like to say that our national anthem also says that we stand on guard for thee . 
i would like to know who is standing guard for the nation ? 
every group has its defenders . 
every group has people who speak for it . 
i would like to know who is going to speak for the nation in this debate . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
there is no demonstrated leadership from the federal government right now and that is a big part of the problem . 
in speaking to the first comment made by my hon. colleague , I would have to go back to the comments I made in my intervention . 
when we break from basic democratic principles and values , when we wander away from the principle of the equality of all citizens before the law , regardless of how good our intentions are , regardless of how noble our motives are , we are creating the environment that leads to the kind of conflict and confrontation that we see today . 
human nature is universal . 
human nature has been with us as long as there have been human beings . 
it is universal and it does not change . 
we have learned over a period of 10,000 years that with basic democratic institutions we can arrange society in a way that we can move forward in peace and harmony . 
when we start to undermine those basic core principles and values we get the kind of results that we see today on the east coast of Canada . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Nisga ' a treaty gives 25 % of the salmon returning to the Nass River to the Nisga ' a . 
four other bands are competing for access to that resource whose treaty claims have not been negotiated . 
the Nisga ' a treaty is a modern version of the 1760 treaty in Marshall that the supreme court ruled on . 
it is a much expanded version , by the way , in that it gives natives a priority right to fish . 
seeing that there is so much consternation in the House today I would like to ask the member to his knowledge what position have other parties taken with regard to the Nisga ' a treaty , given its close proximity in relationship to the treaty we are discussing . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
Mr. Speaker , to the very best of my knowledge every party in the House save the Reform Party of Canada is supportive of the Nisga ' a treaty . 
every party has indicated that they will be voting in favour of the treaty . 
every party has expressed a desire to have the treaty passed with speed . 
frankly that is a good question by the member from Delta because with the problems that we see coming out of the supreme court in the Marshall case , based on this ancient treaty which as I said is very thin , we can just imagine the kinds of problems that could arise from the Nisga ' a treaty . 
it really bears sober second thought . 
it really bears a good debate and it really bears careful consideration of the kinds of problems we might be opening ourselves to down the road , given the instance of the Marshall decision and how it has impacted on the east coast fishery . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Malpeque . 
this has been an interesting debate , a fruitful debate . 
sometimes I wondered what the debate was about . 
we had a lot of discussion about the Supreme Court of Canada and about judicial law making . 
that is a valuable subject but it might deserve an arena in its own right . 
it does touch on the issue of the fisheries and the issue of aboriginal rights , and I will treat it only in that context and where it does have a relevance . 
the important thing to remember here is the maxim of the wisest of common law legal philosophers , Jeremy Bentham . 
he was saying that law was not made by any single person or institution . 
i will have something to say on that in a moment . 
what I am about to suggest is a larger role for the judiciary and for other constitutional players . 
one of the most thoughtful of our members of the press gallery , Jeffrey Simpson , wrote several weeks ago in an article that reminded me of something I wrote many years ago on the discussion of Brown v Board of Education which has been much criticized in the House and elsewhere but by people who never the read the judgment . 
this so often happens . 
brown v Board of Education is really two cases . 
one is the actual judgment on school segregation . 
it is a phrase taken from equity . 
it was used by Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter , the greatest of the Roosevelt appointments to the supreme court . 
it directed attention to the basic point that complex social problems require complex solutions which need complex evidence . 
this is where the United States supreme court has perfected a role that may be helpful to us to study . 
the solution of fisheries problems on the east coast , the solution of logging problems on the west bank of Okanagan Lake , and the solution of other problems of aboriginal rights should be done best against a background of social economic evidence . 
we have in this country , because I see them consulted internationally , experts in economic resources and economic resource management . 
this is the sort of case for wise decision that requires taking that type of evidence into account . 
the big thrust of the second decision in Brown v the Board of Education was that there was a role for a third party in monitoring the solution . 
the emphasis of the phrase " with all deliberate speed " was that it would not be a solution achieved in one day , or in a single ruling , but might require a number of years of supervision , monitoring , consulting with and directing the parties . 
this is where a role , whether it is executive , legislative , judicial , or a combination of both , is an essential part of the problem solving . 
in the American context it was clearly an ample judicial role . 
this in the Canadian context has to be borne in mind in connection with the nature of our supreme court . 
i am very much surprised and a little disturbed because I think it follows from lack of study of supreme court decisions a suggestion of class bias in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
i would not have found that at all . 
i would have suggested a highly technical approach that sometimes would benefit by more opening to sociological facts , economic facts which are the root of decision making . 
in this case I would call for a Brandeis brief . 
the whole nature of jurisprudence before the constitutional court is the adducing of evidence , social and economic evidence . 
in the case of fisheries it would be the nature of the resource , how much is there , what proposals cans be made for its utilization and for its sharing . 
here I take us back to one of the nicer phrases of our supreme court , one of the wiser counsels , the obligations to negotiate and to negotiate in good faith . 
it is a very positive factor in my approach to the Nisga ' a treaty which I believe the chief and council of the Nisga ' a band negotiated in good faith . 
i would be less supportive of other initiatives in this area if I did not have the same feeling of satisfaction that negotiation in good faith involves a concept of recognition of good neighbourliness . 
these are phrases that the World Court has used but they apply equally in the common law from which the Polish judge who cited them borrowed those phrases directly . 
there are important gaps in our law as to aboriginal rights and treaty rights . 
one of these very obviously is the meaning of aboriginal rights and treaty rights . 
they are in sections 25 and 35 of the charter , but they were put there as what is called saving clauses . 
they are put in there because they were not there in the original charter of rights . 
there are further gaps in the law in so far as section 35 ( 1 ) saves existing rights , but section 35 ( 3 ) which was adopted 12 months later recognizes and constitutionalizes future treaties . 
i have expressed in the House some questions on this point . 
could a future treaty which ran counter to the charter or the constitution proper be constitutionalized and override them ? 
i simply point out that there is the need for work to be done . 
i welcome in the exchanges in this debate the recognition by the two ministers who have spoken , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , that it is not possible to view aboriginal rights in the context of single departments isolated from each other . 
we are moving toward a comprehensive view , but it is an educational process that involves all the institutions of government and may , I respectfully suggest , involve all the members of Parliament . 
it is a learning experience for us . 
in particular , one of the things I would suggest is that there is too much absolutism in this area . 
the original theories of acquisition of rights by European settlers , whether they were British , French , German or Danish - one can run through the list - were based on absolutist theories such as terra nullius or unoccupied land . 
these theories were rejected by the International Court in 1975 and , to give credit , were accepted by the early 1980 s in Canadian thinking as incorrect . 
the evidence led to the constitution repatriation project that was accepted . 
i would also suggest that it is an equal error to proceed to other absolutist views that it is one or the other , that one party wins absolutely and one loses absolutely . 
the wise solutions here are in the recognition of comparative rights , that original so to speak inherent rights may also be subject to being balanced by supervening rights , particularly supervening rights obtained in good faith by those exercising them . 
what we are getting into is a complicated process of identifying , quantifying and balancing different competing rights . 
the solutions here , and there ample ways of doing it that require work , are in terms of comparative equities . 
the solution is never one absolutely that these are one ' s rights and everybody else loses . 
it is a complicated process of sorting out and in a way sharing . 
this is where we come back to the concept of judge and company . 
all the players are involved . 
this debate shows a recognition that some sort of long range solution is needed , but I do think we will need the courts as a part of it . 
i do not think executive legislative authority can do it alone . 
i do not think legislation can do it . 
i think the court can be brought into the processes more fully . 
those would be my suggestions to the House . 
criticisms of the court , as such , should be saved for another occasion and we will put forward suggestions for improving the court . 
we may find that the judges are very well - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am terribly sorry to interrupt , but if I did not stand I do not think the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra would sit down . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can see that you are trying to please everyone , but you should not make enemies in your own party . 
many members would like to speak , so I will ask the two questions I have . 
i am a bit surprised at the suggestion that we should go back to the court with this decision . 
let me ask first this question , just to make sure I did not misunderstand the last remarks of the hon. member opposite . 
did he say that we will have to go back to the court to get an interpretation of the decision in the Marshall case ? 
here is my second question . 
how can we deal with the situation , when the court asks us to do our job and negotiate what a moderate livelihood should mean ? 
would the hon. member care to comment ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
could the hon. member repeat his second question ? 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
i wanted to know what a moderate livelihood is . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt , but the hon. member ' s time is up . 
the hon. member for Delta - South Richmond . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member opposite raised the column by Jeffrey Simpson which appeared in the Globe and Mail . 
i quote from a couple of paragraphs : 
that court ruled in 1954 in Brown v Board of Education of Topeka that the so - called " separate but equal " doctrine used to justify segregation was unconstitutional because " separate educational facilities are inherently unequal '' . 
it is an interesting concept when applied to the fisheries here . 
Mr. Simpson went on to write : 
usually forgotten is that there were two Brown cases . 
the next year , after hearing evidence about how the 1954 ruling should be applied , the court gave school and political authorities breathing room to implement the first decision . 
the judges said authorities should act with " all deliberate speed " and required them to " make a prompt and reasonable start '' . 
they did not , in either the first or second Brown rulings , require that the next day the existing order of things be overturned . 
the court was obviously alive both to the important principles it enunciated and to the need for a period of adjustment . 
would that the Supreme Court of Canada had been so alive in the Marshall case . 
given these comments , would the member opposite not think it wise and prudent to go back to the court for a stay of judgment and a rehearing of the case to give some advise to the government ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
Mr. Speaker , that was the question of the hon. member opposite and we answered it on the general point . 
what Mr. Simpson is referring to is what in fact followed with Brown v the Board of Education No. 2 . It was a process that was before the courts over a considerable number of years , not just a one shot return . 
i have nothing against the one shot return , but I would envisage the solution of this problem , west coast logging and similar problems , a process that involves court and executive power working together , the parties constantly before the courts and over a period of years . 
in my view that would be a sophisticated solution . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
part of the problem is that we have depended upon the courts to settle these issues instead of depending upon modern day treaties where we look at some type of conclusion and closure to the entire issue . 
if we continue to fight the before the courts we will get deeper and deeper into the quagmire we are in . 
it is a mistake to go in that direction . 
i would like the member ' s comments on that and the fact that if we continue to go before the courts we should listen to what the courts have told us in every solution they have brought down . 
this is not their job . 
they do not see it as their job and they do not want it to be their job . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney : 
Mr. Speaker , I would not put words into the mouth of the courts as to what they want and do not want . 
that seems to me to be best done by a court . 
if we go that way we are into comparative equities . 
that is what I was talking about . 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a lot has been said tonight but we need to take a look at the motion itself and pull things into perspective . 
the motion reads : 
that this House take note of the difficulties in Canadian fisheries , especially as complicated by the Queen and Marshall case and its implications for both aboriginal and non - aboriginal peoples and for the future management of natural resources . 
some have taken sides on that motion tonight . 
i want to specifically say that I am not taking sides . 
we have to recognize the decision and try to figure out a strategy as a government and as members of the parliament of Canada on how we implement that decision in a fair and reasonable way and ensure that all those players who fish and make their livelihoods at other natural resources can do so in a way that conserves the stocks and live in reasonable prosperity . 
as the motion says , we are indeed faced with a serious crisis . 
some members have mentioned this evening that this crisis seems to be escalating with the potential collapse of the voluntary moratorium negotiated by the minister last Sunday . 
i have talked to the minister a number of times about the issue . 
i know he had hoped that goodwill and tolerance would prevail . 
over the weekend the minister had gone a long way to achieving a satisfactory interim solution . 
what we really need is peace in the water and a timeframe in which to institute a regulatory plan to manage the fishery situation in a reasonable way . 
the seriousness of the situation is perhaps outlined best by a constituent of mine , Barry Murray , who is a fisherman in the Malpeque Bay area . 
he wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i will quote sections from his letter because it outlines the seriousness . 
he wrote : 
there are individuals with strong feelings on both sides of this argument , and these personalities are at a heightened state of volatility that will take very few more sparks to ignite violence . 
once started , this slippery slope may quite possibly devastate both communities . 
i am not trying to exaggerate . 
there is potential for a lobster stock crisis and community unrest that would rival the cod crisis of the early eighties . 
he closed by saying : 
Mr. Minister , please close these out of control aboriginal fisheries for conservation reasons until such a time that an agreement can be put in place that will amply protect the stocks and protect our fishing communities . 
Mr. Murray outlines the serious volatility and the serious situation in terms of the lobster fish stocks in Malpeque Bay , the area he knows best . 
i do not mind admitting I am disappointed that the supreme court did not grant a timeframe . 
it is important for us to look at the facts tonight . 
we are hearing all kinds of things , and people are basing their interpretations of what the supreme court said on the media instead of on reading the judgment . 
what did the decision say ? 
the supreme court found that Donald Marshall had a treaty right to fish for and to sell eels , which extended beyond the already established right of aboriginal people to fish for food and ceremonial purposes . 
the court also stated that this right to sell fish would be carried out within certain limits . 
section 58 of the decision states : 
what is contemplated is not a right to trade generally for economic gain but rather a right to trade for necessaries . 
the treaty right is a regulated right and can be contained by regulation within its proper limits . 
the court indicated that necessaries had been defined as moderate livelihood which according to the court in section 59 includes " such basics as food , clothing and housing supplemented by a few amenities but not the accumulation of wealth . 
it addresses day to day needs '' . 
section 61 of the decision places the limitations of the Marshall decision within context . 
according to this section it is very important that " catch limits that could reasonably be expected to produce a moderate livelihood for individual Mi ' kmaq families at present day standards can be established by regulation and enforced without violating the treaty right . 
in that case regulations would accommodate the treaty right '' . 
that is what the decision states . 
the aboriginal fishing strategy has been in place since 1992 . 
because of the Sparrow decision it was moving along the line and doing what the supreme court now recognizes as a right . 
the aboriginal fishing strategy was the government ' s response to the Sparrow decision . 
through the aboriginal fishing strategy the Government of Canada and DFO were buying licenses from retiring fishermen and turning them over to the aboriginal community so it could have a livelihood on the water as the supreme court said is its right . 
thirty - two million dollars annually has been spent on the aboriginal fishing strategy . 
the member from Delta can like it or lump it . 
those are the facts . 
the court did affirm certain rights of the Mi ' kmaq that originated with the treaties extending back to 1760 . 
what is at issue here is not the ruling but how to respond in a balanced way to the aboriginal community and the non - aboriginal community so they can survive and prosper together . 
i applaud the minister for his efforts through dialogue and co - operation . 
however , if things might be happening tonight and the fishing effort is above the amount anticipated when the minister made his decision last Sunday , I believe he should consider using his authority under section 43 of the Fisheries Act in the interest of conservation . 
at the moment the impact of even a small fishing effort on lobsters could be serious . 
let us we look at what has been happening with the government over the last number of years . 
we could go back to a release by the former minister of fisheries on April 22 , 1998 . It outlines that the November 1995 report of the Fisheries Resources Conservation Council advised that lobster fishermen were " taking too much and leaving too little '' . 
as a result of the FRCC report and as the minister of the day decided that we needed to double lobster egg production in the lobster fishing areas , new conservation measures were instituted . 
escape mechanisms were put on traps . 
lobster tariffs and sizes were increased . 
v - notching was considered . 
quite a number of management measures were imposed upon the industry . 
it is serious . 
i maintain that if there is any lobster fishing over and above what the minister anticipated on his agreement reached last Sunday , then he has the authority to act under section 43 of the Fisheries Act . 
he should take that authority and institute that action to prevent jeopardizing the future of the lobster fishery . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , even though the Liberal member who just spoke has a lot of support for his comments from the Conservative Party behind me , that does not mean to say that he is correct . 
when he said that the aboriginal fishing strategy of British Columbia was a direct result of the efforts by the government to try to enact the provisions of the Sparrow decision of the Supreme Court of Canada , he is just plain wrong , as was the judge in the R . v Houvinen case , which was recently ruled on by the British Columbia supreme court . 
the Sparrow decision of the Supreme Court of Canada expressly refused to deal with the native commercial fishery . 
that was left for subsequent cases , namely Gladstone , Vanderpeet and NTC Smokehouse . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry , we will have to ask the hon. member for Malpeque to respond to that because there are two others . 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
Mr. Speaker , I would very much love to answer that question . 
if members will recall what I said to the member for Delta - South Richmond and what I said in my remarks , it was that the government was being proactive . 
the government recognized in the Sparrow decision the right of the fishery for food and ceremonial purposes . 
we recognized as a government that there may be other treaty rights coming along and that we had to involve the aboriginal community in the fishery sector . 
we took a proactive strategy by trying to do that through the aboriginal fishing strategy to bring the aboriginal community in , in a managed way . 
that is what we were doing and we were moving well on it . 
that is what it is all about . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have never seen so many people taking part so enthusiastically in a debate on fisheries . 
i would like to ask a question of the former parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
i would like to know where the member stands on what the secretary of state said . 
we just heard his call for calm to both native and non - native fishers . 
otherwise , I see a double standard . 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
i always have spoken for myself and I will continue to do that . 
i do not want to get into a numbers game . 
the numbers game has been played in the media a fair bit , that there is only such and such a number of traps . 
we have to keep in mind that in Malpeque Bay and some areas in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at this time of year they trap at about five times the rate of that in June . 
we cannot go by the trap numbers or percentages necessarily . 
if we go back to my remarks , what I argued was conservation . 
the food fishery for the native community in Malpeque Bay was shut down . 
in my view , any lobsters taken over and above the current management plans , which are already maxed out in terms of the pressure on the resource , could be considered a concern for conservation . 
we have to look at the current management plans and ensure that there is no greater effort on that resource as a result of this decision until we have the regulatory regime in place that recognizes this decision and does it in a managed way . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
how is this tardy response on this decision , which permits native fishers to enter this fishery unfettered by regulation and all the rules and regulations in place that are consistent with conservation , and his minister ' s inaction and his government ' s decision not to respond consistent with conservation ? 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
he said very clearly that there will be a regulated fishery or no fishery at all . 
what he tried to achieve through goodwill and discussion was to keep people off the water until the proper regulatory regime could be put in place . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will have to share my time with my colleague from Beauharnois - Salaberry , unless the House gives us more time . 
the motion says that speeches cannot exceed 20 minutes , but if I can have more time , I will take it . 
i took a few notes during the minister ' s speech , and since he has not yet left to catch a plane despite the advice he was given , I will take this opportunity to tell him what I think . 
we like having the opportunity to talk to him , but when there is an emergency , he should be there where he is most needed . 
all we need to do next is to define the words " moderate livelihood '' . 
it is unfortunate that at this stage I am the one who has to answer the questions . 
however , I will ask a series of questions he can answer in the questions and comments period if he wants to . 
what we are trying to get a definition of is the expression " moderate livelihood '' . 
that is the hardest thing to do here . 
and I know that the minister , who was a businessman , knows that . 
for a businessman , the hardest thing to do is to bring people to the negotiation table , but the minister ' s experience could be helpful in this instance . 
i think that the court gave some useful indications . 
i mean that when one does not want to be stuck , as we are , with a bad judgement , one tries to negotiate an agreement , even a bad one . 
in the present situation , the minister will have the opportunity to introduce legislation , to regulate fisheries . 
i recognize that the other party will not like the first set of rules . 
however , the only way to settle the issue is to go to court or sit down and negotiate . 
i imagine I am not telling the minister anything new this evening , but I am keen to see the agenda he will set . 
all we saw on the television was the minister calling for a 30 day moratorium . 
we were not told who he would be sitting down with to negotiate . 
i also noted in my speech today the fact that he intends to negotiate with the current beneficiaries , and mentioned that they are the current incarnations of the treaty signatories . 
i would like to get to know this better in good French or in business language , but I would like a complete list to be sure that there will not be other players joining a month after negotiations have begun . 
i would also like the minister to take note when I ask what he is going to do during his 30 days . 
we would need to know his agenda , what will be negotiated and who will be sitting around the table . 
certainly , there will be representatives of the fishers , other federal ministers and provincial ones too , I hope . 
the House must be reminded that , for every seafaring man , there are , as a rule of thumb , five people working on land . 
thought must be given as well to the consequences of processing . 
still in the context of what is to be prepared , when will we know exactly who will be involved in the negotiations ? 
negotiations must deal with " moderate livelihood '' , but the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans signed the UN fishing agreement this summer . 
article 5 pertains to commercial fishers as we know them and mentions that the signatory countries are committed to establishing and developing sustainable and profitable fishing . 
in this international agreement definition , I do not see the beginnings of the definition of profitable in the vocabulary of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans here in Canada . 
it is an international agreement in which all the UN countries say , each time the development of fisheries is discussed , " without subsidies '' . 
what does " without subsidies '' , as used internationally , mean in Canadian terms ? 
does it include EI ? 
does it include the interest deductions allowed by certain provinces on boats ? 
i need to know what form the profitable fisheries the minister has already administered would take , because I already imagine the moderate livelihood they have in mind for aboriginals is at least one step up from the threshold of profitability . 
i would also like to see a start made on defining the level of profitability as understood by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
one thing that worried me about the minister ' s remarks was his comment that they had not yet taken in all the implications of the decision . 
i would have preferred not to harangue the minister unduly when he is new to the job , but it is unfortunate that his department did not have a plan B , particularly when they lost . 
out of respect for native and non - native fishers , I will perhaps avoid trite plays on words here this evening but , in some cases , they have a plan B ready , and in some cases they do not . 
i would also like to know what the minister thinks about the different management styles throughout the world because , while we are on the aboriginal problem , I think that the 1867 legislation as it pertains to fisheries should also be revisited because , under the treaties , the discretionary nature of licences does not meet the aboriginal criterion . 
we should take this opportunity to dust off Canada ' s old fisheries act . 
but the most serious problem is the historic sharing between the provinces . 
if we end up having to define the resources we are going to have to give the native fishers , we will need to know where those resources are coming from . 
rather than get into individual calculations , why not take the opportunity to look into some form of sharing ? 
there are management systems and Canada is part of one in which the percentage of each participant is determined before the total allowable catch is calculated each year . 
why could what is good for Canada when it seeks to reach agreement with its colleagues outside its borders not be good for working with colleagues within its borders ? 
i ask the minister that . 
if my choice of vocabulary happens to grate on the ears of the minister or his officials , I would invite them to re - examine the French model , which speaks of stabilization criteria rather than historical share . 
in other words , I am appealing to a quality in the minister that can sometimes be a defect , but in this case can be positive . 
a businessman needs tools if he is to manage . 
in order to manage , he must be able to plan , and to know how he is going to pay for his boat and for his groceries . 
the same thing goes for an aboriginal fisher , who has to know how and where he is going to fish , and in what quantities . 
meanwhile , there are short term tools to determine what is needed to buy social peace . 
there are some people who need to make decisions about investing in a boat this winter . 
they may say to themselves that it is better for them to sell their fishing licence to Fisheries and Oceans because the size of the quota for the coming years is too unpredictable . 
the government needs to take all of this into account . 
if it does not do so as soon as possible , I think it will be irresponsible , and things will be worse than they were right after September 17 . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to ask my hon. colleague who sits on the fisheries committee , who is from the beautiful area of the Gasp é , one very simple question . 
prior to my colleague ' s speech we heard the speech of a member of the Liberal Party , the governing party , and I am singing hallelujah for this . 
they have finally recognized and are starting to believe exactly what the auditor general said last April , that shellfish stocks , mainly lobsters , are in trouble . 
this was back in April , long before the Marshall decision was rendered . 
who does the member think is responsible for the downturn in the lobster fishery which the auditor general pointed out and which DFO itself still does not recognize as a very serious problem in Atlantic Canada ? 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
i am glad the member has raised this point . 
this is something the auditor general raised . 
i know the representatives of some fishers ' associations believe the auditor general is not really the one who should decide this . 
however , there is a problem . 
the member ' s question was right and very much to the point . 
it is up to us now to look into all this . 
i would remind the House that what the auditor general said and what is contained in the report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans about the situation on the Atlantic coast - and this was a unanimous all - party report - is that everybody agrees that there is a management problem at Fisheries and Oceans and that things have to change . 
if the Marshall decision is the opportunity to start anew , I think we should seize it . 
what is being pointed out is significant . 
there is a management problem . 
i am tired of hearing the same worn out old record to the effect that it is a conservation problem when it is in fact a management problem . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has been in the Chamber tonight and he has listened to the to and fro of the debate . 
there has been a lot of discussion about the Nisga ' a treaty and about the supreme court . 
these are two issues upon which we need to shed more light . 
first of all , as was said earlier , the supreme court said in many of its earlier rulings that it does not see this as its job . 
the supreme court sees this as the job of the government . 
that is the first point . 
we do not have a modern day treaty . 
we are dependent upon supreme court judgments , which have caused serious confusion , and we have also had a lack of response from the government on this issue . 
would the member prefer a modern day treaty and consistency , or would he prefer that the supreme court deal with this so that we would have inconsistencies and a lack of response from the government ? 
what is his feeling on that ? 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
Mr. Speaker , if I understood the question , the member is asking me whether I prefer to go back to the courts or put up with further laxity and carelessness from the other side of the House . 
pardon the expression , but there is a French saying about it not mattering whether one is bitten by a dog or a bitch . 
i would not like to give the judges this responsibility , and I see that there is a lack of leadership on the other side . 
how will we , on this side of the House , find a way to put pressure on them so that they come to their senses ? 
i do not know . 
many people have suggested that the truth or the way to get out of this mess might well come from the grassroots , and I believe that . 
once the stunned reaction of our non - native fishers has passed - I believe them to be very peaceful people - they will be able to come up with solutions . 
we must have confidence in eastern Canadians . 
we have always overcome crises , and we will again . 
together , with the communities involved , we must find a way to get the government to take its responsibilities . 
but , I repeat , Grit or Tory , the problem always remains the same . 
there is a management problem at Fisheries and Oceans , and it is not for nothing that the standing committee unanimously pointed the finger not necessarily at the government but at the management style in that department . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will try to breathe a bit of life into this debate in spite of the late hour . 
i am pleased to rise after my colleague from Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , who also speaks with so much conviction when he deals with fishery matters and when he talks on our party ' s behalf on those subjects that interest him so much and for which he serves his constituency so well . 
i was also pleased to hear my colleague from Saint - Jean , our critic for aboriginal affairs , who presented his concerns on the subject debated tonight . 
i would like to remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois is really interested in this subject because of its constitutional aspect . 
it is a matter that touches on the relations between the native people , or nations as we prefer to call them in Quebec , and the other inhabitants of the country . 
we now have to participate in a debate that will have consequences for our future , the future of Quebec and the future of Canada , the relations between Quebec , Canada and the natives people who belong to one or the other of those jurisdictions . 
i have had the opportunity to hear part of the debate and I would now like to talk about constitutional issues and the Constitution , and mention that in a sovereign Quebec we will avoid problems such as those faced today by Canada as a result of the laissez - faire attitude of this government , and of its failure to truly follow through on its constitutional commitment as stated in section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , which says , and I quote the first subsection " The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed '' . 
enshrining things in the Constitution is not enough . 
native peoples know full well it is not enough to have their rights recognized and affirmed in the Constitution . 
these rights must be implemented and exercised ; the existing laws , the laws which were in force when this section came into force in 1982 must be reviewed and amended to reflect those rights . 
this is the root cause of the problem we are facing today and which is the topic of the motion before us . 
as a matter of fact , if one looks at the Marshall decision , the court says something very telling about the refusal to recognize the treaty rights at issue in this case . 
the court said , and I quote : 
" mi ' kmaq treaty rights were not accommodated in the regulations because presumably the crown ' s position was and continues to be that no such treaty rights existed '' . 
the court affirms that such were the position and the views of the crown . 
this clearly explains why regulations were adopted to give total discretion , and that discretion was exercised to deny rights granted by treaties that were , appropriately , widely and liberally interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada . 
so , it is carelessness on the part of the government that has put citizens , people sharing the land who also want to share the resource , in a crisis situation . 
we Quebecers experiencing this constitutional crisis fully understand and share the concerns of aboriginal nations , which have seen their constitutional rights trampled , a government hesitate and refuse to sit down and negotiate in good faith not only as regards the way their rights are recognized , but also the limitations that can be imposed on these rights , since the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada has led to the adoption of restrictions that are reasonable when it comes to the treaty rights of aboriginal nations . 
all this to say that , from a constitutional point of view , this shows once again the flaws of our constitution when dealing with one of the peoples of Canada , with aboriginal peoples in general . 
it did so in 1985 for 10 of them , and in 1987 for the Malecite nation . 
not only did the Quebec government recognize their existence , it also indicated its determination to conclude agreements with each of the aboriginal nations . 
in the 1985 motion , these agreements guaranteed the right to hunt , fish , trap , harvest and participate in the management of wildlife resources . 
this explicit recognition of the right to fish was expressed in a motion dating back to 1985 . 
since then , negotiations have been carried out in good faith to follow up on these commitments . 
sovereignist parties and members of this sovereignist coalition have also re - iterated the commitment they made in the 1990 s to ensure that aboriginal people would be entitled to self - government within a sovereign Quebec and would even be able to take part in the drafting of a constitution where their autonomy would be recognized . 
as we have so clearly said before , once the draft legislation on sovereignty has been proposed to Quebecers , once the bill on Quebec ' s future has been drafted , following numerous consultations of Quebecers through regional and national commissions , the Parti Quebecois ' s current agenda provides that : 
- the constitution of a sovereign Quebec recognize the right of the native people to govern themselves on lands belonging to their people and to take part in the development of Quebec . Also the current constitutional rights of aboriginal people , their treaty rights and their aboriginal titles would also be confirmed by a sovereign Quebec . 
lastly , I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois is currently considering a major proposal in which its members are also urged to re - iterate their commitment to recognizing the existing rights of the aboriginal people , to confirming these rights and to ensuring that negotiations are carried out with the native people of Quebec in order to recognize their right to self - government . 
we also stipulate in this major proposal that the relationship between the native people , a sovereign Quebec and Canada could be governed by a partnership agreement that would ensure that these people and nations continue to enjoy a friendly relationship and that the native people would not , as the supreme court said in the Marshall judgement , be considered as " citizens minus '' , but as first - class citizens in a sovereign Quebec and a sovereign Canada . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member for Vancouver Quadra mentioned that in terms of long term solutions the executive legislature and the judiciary of the supreme court should get together to work toward solutions or come up with definitive reasoning for long term solutions not only in this particular instance but in other instances . 
would the hon. member from the Bloc agree that there needs to be a joint effort between the elected officials of parliament who represent Canada and the supreme court to come to reasonable conclusions in this particular instance ? 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the supreme court has done its job . 
my colleague from Saint - Jean set out the decisions that attempted to interpret section 35 and give it content . 
the supreme court told the government that it could limit rights in order to manage and conserve the resource . 
it might be advisable for the legislators in this House to revise old legislation on fishing , as my colleague from Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok proposed , to incorporate the full scope of the ancestral and treaty rights of the aboriginal nations in a broader fishing policy . 
that seems more preferable to me than a regulation that would be adopted and selected by the government and only the government . 
i can see a role for this House in implementing ancestral and sub - treaty rights for other aboriginal nations . 
in my opinion , this House must assume its responsibilities . 
it is up to the government especially to ensure that this House assumes its responsibilities , something it does not seem to want to do at the moment . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the question raised by the NDP member and the reply from the member for Beauharnois - Salaberry brings me to another point . 
what other skeletons are the Liberals hiding in their closet ? 
are there other costs like this that we are not aware of ? 
people have a right to know . 
all of us , myself included , were kept in the dark . 
when I was a little boy , I played with friends , not knowing that they would have more rights than I do today . 
i am very glad for them , but I did not know . 
Canadians should be told once and for all what other swords of Damocles are hanging over their heads , and not necessarily just in the fishery . 
this evening , we are looking at the native problem in the context of the Maritime fisheries crisis . 
but to use a good old Maritime expression , this is perhaps just the tip of the iceberg . 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
Mr. Speaker , I will only remind the House that the present crisis seems to be triggering other crises , since the Innu said that they could have additional claims relating to the Churchill Falls project . 
in British Columbia , the chief of the Nanoose first nation would like the confirmed or at least claimed rights of his people reviewed in light of the Marshall decision . 
canada probably gives them nightmares . 
this is unacceptable in a country that some people boast about being the best country in the world . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
however , knowing that there are quite a few night owls among Acadians , I am sure some of them are listening to me right now . 
it is a pleasure for me to say a few words tonight about the decision handed down by the supreme court in the Marshall case . 
this decision has been taken seriously by all Canadians , and we have been hearing about it for several weeks . 
the peace treaty was signed in 1760 and , 250 years later , we have to interpret what happened . 
we must not forget that , in those 250 years , the Conservatives were often in office , including for a period of nine years mostly in the 1980 s . 
they cannot stand up and blame the Liberals , because problems occurred when both parties formed the government . 
but , tonight , we can blame everybody . 
one thing we know is that there was a treaty . 
we can say that governments did not respond to the requests made by aboriginal people after the treaty . 
today , we have to deal with a decision which was brought about by the inaction of governments . 
fishers from my riding have contacted me to tell me that they are willing to recognize the rights of native fishers , but that we must negotiate . 
an aboriginal woman from Burnt Church was quoted last week as saying that native - white relations had been developing in the right direction over the past hundred years . 
today it seems to her that everything has to be started all over again . 
we have some responsibility in all that . 
when the decision was released , I recall that my colleague , the fisheries critic , sent a letter to the minister asking him to summon the all - party standing committee to a meeting in Ottawa in order to discuss the situation . 
last week , I myself sent a letter to the minister , with no reply . 
he is asking us all to work together . 
even today , as we speak , the all - party committee has not yet been called together to discuss the situation . 
the only thing , then , is that violence is a possibility . 
all sorts of things can happen , but in the end it is negotiation that will solve these problems . 
therefore , I am calling upon the people in my riding , as well as those in the neighbouring riding of Miramichi , to take things calmly , and to enter into negotiations in order to solve the problem . 
that is the only means to settlement . 
judging from my labour union experience , regardless of what conflicts have taken place , regardless of whether it took three months to settle them , or six , the only place there was a settlement was at the negotiating table . 
this invitation must therefore be responded to . 
the two groups , native and non - native , must be invited to the negotiating table , and it must be done as soon as possible . 
not a week from today . 
i will go even farther . 
i will tell you that I have concerns . 
are we going to wait yet again to have a crisis in the lobster industry and after that another crisis in the crab industry ? 
and after that we will respond to that crisis and then we will have another one in the herring industry and after that we will respond to the crisis in the herring industry . 
we must find a solution together . 
the government is capable of choosing an approach the fishers would agree to . 
some fishers might be ready to sell their license . 
some people who have reached the age of 55 or 60 would be prepared to retire . 
so the government could become involved in buying back their licenses and make these licenses available to the native bands in order to resolve this problem that has gone on unresolved for 250 years . 
we have a 250 year old treaty , with all the lawyers we have in Canada . 
they are intelligent enough to be in the House of Commons ? 
i am happy today not to be a lawyer . 
i am also happy that the minister is not a lawyer . 
so , perhaps we can solve the problem today . 
it took 250 years to interpret a peace treaty signed with the aboriginals . 
today , we are all panicking and we are not prepared to react after 250 years . 
we should be ashamed of our governments . 
this is why I urge you not to wait for a week . 
we cannot wait until people fight with one another . 
we cannot wait until violence erupts . 
people are concerned . 
they want to sit down , negotiate and find a solution . 
it takes leadership to achieve that . 
there are crises everywhere these days . 
there is a problem with the airlines . 
there is a problem with the immigrants arriving in the Vancouver area . 
again , the government does not know how to deal with this issue . 
there are problems everywhere . 
it is time to act before we lose control of our country . 
the federal government and the Liberals have that responsibility that Canadians have given them . 
the government waits for weeks on end , but the aboriginal people have been saying for years that they want a solution to their problems . 
when the Conservatives signed the free trade agreement , it did not take them long to adjust the whole Canadian program to free trade . 
it did not take them years to do that . 
it seems as if the issue between aboriginal and white peoples could take a year or two to solve . 
this is not true . 
we cannot have such an attitude . 
we must settle the issue now . 
we must not wait a year to do that . 
we must sit with these people and solve the problem . 
there are solutions . 
i am convinced that when fishers , aboriginals and a government that shows leadership sit together at the table , solutions will be found . 
i urge the government , I urge the minister , who just got the job , to make a name for himself by being a good Minister of Fisheries and solving the problems we are facing in Canada . 
this is what I ask him to do . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will try to be brief , because I see that members still have many questions to ask . 
i would like to tell my colleague that he is right when he says that our constituents are wondering what they will be allowed to fish , even if they are not fishing lobster right now . 
he mentioned those who fish herring or crab . 
i would like the member to tell us what we can do to get the Liberals to see reason . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague for his question . 
he spoke about the harmonized GST and said that the matter was settled quickly . 
it does not mean , however , that we , the people of the Atlantic , welcomed it . 
but they did it anyway and it did not take long . 
i wish to thank the government for having allowed us , tonight , to discuss part of the problem . 
after all , I hope the minister , who is here tonight , who is listening to what we have to say , can react . 
we must act now and force the government to act and tell it that if it does not , it should not ask us to work with it . 
if it does not act , it should not tell us that we are unwilling to co - operate because , tonight , we are working with it and offering solutions . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I heard a fair amount of discussion tonight from the NDP members who rose to speak . 
there was discussion earlier that they had been in contact with fishermen who live in the South Shore riding and in West Nova riding . 
i was at the meeting in Yarmouth . 
i did not see any NDP members of Parliament there . 
i have talked with hundreds of fishermen and I have not talked to one who has been in contact with these NDP members of Parliament . 
i have listened to what these members have said , which is little better than nothing . 
what I now want to know is simple and I want a straightforward answer . 
would the New Democratic Party support a moratorium on this decision immediately to allow time for first nations , fishers and DFO to sit down and formulate a plan for the peaceful integration of first nations into the fishery ? 
will it support an immediate moratorium on this decision ? 
Mr. Yvon Godin : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very sad that after 250 years these members still cannot recognize that we have a problem and at the Supreme Court of Canada has made a decision . 
that is why I am recommending that we be at the negotiating table tomorrow morning to negotiate something with the two groups who are the non - natives and the native people . 
the member talked about the NDP not doing or saying anything . 
i was on a radio station the other day when my colleague from Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac said that it was not the government ' s responsibility to resolve the problem but the responsibility of the community and that the community was destroying itself right now . 
it is the responsibility of the government to come down and resolve the problem with the people down home and get to the table . 
we have spoken to more fishermen than you ever have as a Conservative . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i would like to remind hon. members to address each other through the Chair please . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is getting late in the evening and it looks as if I may be the last speaker on this very valuable debate . 
i want to thank the Conservative Party ' s House leader for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough for bringing forward this issue for a take note debate . 
it is too bad it is not an emergency debate . 
i also wish to thank the government for allowing us this take note debate . 
i hope the it is understanding the very serious nature of this issue . 
my colleague from New Brunswick mentioned that this is not just about lobsters . 
this is about every single fish species that we have , not only in Atlantic Canada but clearly right across the country . 
aboriginal people in our prairie provinces are looking at the Marshall decision to see what it means to their role at the FFMC that they have in Winnipeg . 
they have great problems with that . 
aboriginal people on the west coast are looking at this decision in terms of what they believe are their timber rights and their fishing rights . 
people across the country are very seriously concerned about what this decision means in their lives . 
it is not just about lobsters . 
we are talking about the lobster issue right now because tomorrow morning area 35 , the Bay of Fundy region in Nova Scotia - New Brunswick , will be opening up to the commercial fishery which normally opens up this time of year . 
those men and women will be putting out their boats and going out to catch lobsters . 
we have still not heard a word from the government on how it plans to incorporate the Marshall decision with the aboriginal people to get them into this fishery . 
we have heard from people like Mr. Arthur Bull of the Coastal Community Network of Digby who said they have been working overtime , literally day and night since this decision , to come up with reasonable compromises so that both sides , the aboriginal and the non - aboriginal people , can work together . 
unfortunately there is nothing but silence from the minister ' s department and the government . 
therein lies the problem . 
obviously the minister is getting his advice from what I consider to be very elderly and tired people on the east coast in terms of DFO , people I have had many concerns about in terms of their management policies . 
the Liberal government from 1993 to 1999 has done absolutely nothing . 
the attitudes of the Conservative government and the Liberal government toward aboriginal people in the nation have been very much paternalistic . 
that is exactly what the aboriginal people have done . 
they have gone to court and now the court has rendered its decision . 
whether or not we like it , it is the legal opinion of the country . 
if we start doing that to the Supreme Court of Canada within our constitution we are opening up a bigger can of worms than opposition members or anyone else who is claiming that would be the solution . 
i am going to give the minister four very concrete points on how he could come up with a short term solution . 
one is to immediately reconvene the all party standing committee of fisheries and oceans down in the maritime region . 
the minister and his department obviously refuse to go down there on a long term basis to deal with the issue . 
perception is everyone ' s reality . 
they cannot be seen to be making decisions from Ottawa for Atlantic Canada . 
they must be in Atlantic Canada to put the human and financial resources on the table . 
the grassroots people who work the resource know the resource better than the minister and most politicians in this room . 
they know what the short and long term solutions are . 
the minister must commit the human and financial resources for them to carry on their work . 
second , the minister must consider a voluntary buyout package and a transfer of the licences over to the Mi ' kmaq nation to include them in the fishery . 
the government must find out exactly how many licences would be required on the short term to bring the aboriginal people into the fishery . 
this is very important because conservation is the key . 
everybody must fish under the same conservation guidelines . 
i do not think there is any debate on that . 
the auditor general said last April that lobster stocks , and in fact all shellfish stocks , were in trouble in Atlantic Canada . 
many people criticize the auditor general and me for espousing those views . 
the fact is the auditor general was absolutely correct . 
last April he said that the management policies which caused the cod collapse in 1992 were the same policies in place to handle the groundfish stocks . 
let us not forget that in the spring the Mi ' kmaq asked the Government of Canada to sit at the table to come up with solutions for the short term because they suspected that the Marshall decision would go in their favour . 
they came with an open hand to government asking it to come up with solutions so we can evade the problems that are happening now . 
my colleague from South Shore and my colleague from West Nova are absolutely correct when they say they have never felt the tensions greater than they are now . 
they are absolutely correct when they say that . 
the fact is that the government by sitting back in Ottawa trying to come up with some solution it can grab out of the sky or grab out of the air will not solve the problems . 
government members have to go down there and talk directly to the people involved . 
they must do that in order to add calm to the equation of the argument that is happening right now . 
another thing that has happened within DFO is severe budget cuts to the department itself . 
the department does not have the human or financial resources to monitor enforcement policies , so it calls upon the RCMP to help . 
however , that department ' s resources were cut as well . 
the fact is that we do not even have the proper resources allocated right now in order to protect the stock . 
that is the most important thing . 
it is not just lobster stock but all other shellfish species out there as well . 
if the auditor general was correct and they do collapse , it will make the cod prices look like a drop in the bucket . 
again , the responsibility falls upon this government . 
every single member in this argument today , my colleagues in the Conservative Party , the Reform Party , the Bloc Quebecois and ourselves , has asked for and demanded leadership on this issue . 
it is imperative that the minister show leadership . 
he should get down there and start talking to these people . 
he should not do it from Ottawa . 
this is very important . 
while he is down there discussing this issue , he should seriously consider a community based allocation of these stocks . 
Mr. Arthur Bull of Digby has asked many , many times of the Coastal Community Network of Atlantic Canada and those in western Canada as well to get away from the corporatization of our fish stocks which have concentrated the wealth of the fish stocks in very few hands . 
it is time to start looking at a community based strategy so that all people , aboriginal and non - aboriginal , can work together for the long term benefit of this resource . 
we also have to include what the corporate sector is saying right now . 
they have been very , very silent . 
we have all been working very hard trying to concentrate on protecting the interests of the inshore fishermen . 
what is needed now is leadership from this government . 
this government should not be an ostrich and put its head in the sand and hope the problem goes away . 
government members must get down there and work with the people toward immediate short term solutions that have been presented by all members of the House today . 
they must incorporate those ideas so that we can have a calm fishery . 
we will all benefit in the long term . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
before we go to questions and comments , I want to remind everyone once again to address each other through the Chair . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
for example , the Supreme Court of Canada failed to accurately describe moderate living . 
some native advocates contend that a net annual income of $ 80,000 is a moderate living . 
the Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether the aboriginal tax free status which exists would reduce needed fishery earnings . 
the Supreme Court of Canada did not say whether government contributions to aboriginal communities through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development can offset earnings required from the fishery . 
the Supreme Court of Canada did not determine whether non - status Mi ' kmaq or Maliseet are legally able to participate in the fishery . 
there are an unknown number of non - status Mi ' kmaq or Maliseet , but it is estimated in the tens of thousands . 
DFO is determined that non - status Mi ' kmaq or Maliseet are not eligible under the treaty . 
this will probably be met with a court challenge . 
all I am saying is that these issues will come before the court sooner or later . 
why not do it sooner ? 
why not get the answers now before we go down a garden path that we do not want to be going down ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the question . 
we are the elected officials of this country . 
my colleagues from the Reform Party , the Conservative Party , the Bloc and the Liberal Party , we are the ones who are responsible ultimately to answer to the constituents of this country for legislation . 
if previous Conservative governments and the current Liberal government have refused to negotiate and to legislate , then it is quite obvious that the supreme court will dictate to us what it interprets as the rules and what it interprets as the law . 
once it does this , whether we like the decision or not , we have to live with it . 
we find ourselves in the pickle we are in today because of the failed policies of the current Liberal government and past Conservative governments where they have refused to negotiate long term solutions for the resources of this country . 
it is up to parliament to finally decide this issue . 
it is not up to the supreme court . 
it is our responsibility as parliamentarians to take this issue very seriously . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is absolutely right . 
would the NDP support a moratorium on the decision to allow time for first nations , fishers and DFO to sit down and formulate a plan for the peaceful integration of first nations into the licensed fishery ? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , if I may throw the question back so he can ask it of me again . 
is the member for South Shore asking me about a moratorium on the aboriginal fishery or about a moratorium on the non - aboriginal fishery ? 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , right now we have a supreme court decision dealing with the aboriginal fishery . 
i suggested a moratorium on the aboriginal fishery because that is the only non - licensed fishery out there . 
any licensed fishery , any aboriginal boats that are involved in the licensed fishery would not be subject to it . 
we are only dealing with what the supreme court decision brought down . 
will the NDP support that ? 
i see no other way or plan to bring everyone to the table to allow for the resolution of this matter . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , as much as I would like to say yes to that solution in order to bring some calm to the irrationality , I cannot . 
it is not up to us to break the law . 
the fact is that the supreme court has ordered that . 
it has laid down quite clearly that the aboriginal people have the right to fish in this regard . 
i do not like the idea of their fishing without proper conservation guidelines and without working under the same rules everyone else does . 
however the fact is we cannot override the supreme court decision and say quite clearly that because we are in a mess and a pickle and because parliamentarians and government have screwed this issue up so badly that we are now going to say to the aboriginal people who have waited 240 years for their right that they can no longer do what the supreme court has said they can do . 
the majority of people I have spoken to down there are willing to incorporate the aboriginal fishery into the fishery . 
this is what needs to happen , dialogue and conversation and not useless rhetoric . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the final dying moments of this debate . 
i begin by congratulating the minister of fisheries who in a rare show of interest and willingness to listen to opposition members has stayed here in the House . 
even against the advice of some members of the House that he should be in New Brunswick or in Nova Scotia , he has stayed here and has genuinely listened to and participated in the debate . 
i and other members of this party appreciate that effort and show of good faith . 
i must take him up on a comment he made in his remarks that he had acted quickly . 
we have to revisit the chronology of what has taken place . 
on September 17 the Marshall decision was handed down by the supreme court . 
he said that he acted within three days . 
but what happened ? 
from that point we know that on September 27 the minister spoke of implementing some form of a response , a government action , to inform all stakeholders of what the government intended to do . 
that did not come about . 
on October 9 the chiefs of the aboriginal communities stated that they were willing to embark on the possibility of a moratorium . 
on October 13 , after meeting with the minister , hours after he had departed the maritimes , the chiefs themselves imposed a moratorium . 
it was a self - imposed pre - emptive move to give the government time to respond and to formulate its response . 
sadly , communications have now completely broken down to the point where we know the moratorium is no longer in place . 
the chiefs have decided they will not abide by the self - imposed moratorium . 
that is problematic . 
we can engage in all kinds of partisan rhetoric . 
it is very easy for the Reform and the NDP to cast aspersions on current and past governments , having never had the luxury of having to make those tough decisions . 
it is a very easy thing to do , making statements that are not true . 
it does not make them true simply because they are said in this place . 
the clock is ticking . 
there is more than just preservation of stocks at stake ; there is preservation of human lives at stake . 
the potential for violence is real . 
it has already been played out in certain communities like Burnt Church and it is also on the tip of breaking out in parts of Nova Scotia , on the South Shore in particular and in parts of Cape Breton Island . 
in my riding of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough there are many aboriginal participants already in the commercial fishery . 
there is the ability for peaceful entry into this industry . 
that has been displayed in the past . 
that offer has been extended in the past and I assume it will be extended in the future . 
timeliness is the issue now . 
i know the minister is sincere in his efforts and in his words to find the solutions , but there is little time to waste . 
the minister must be proactive . 
we support him in his efforts to find the solutions , but those solutions will only come from the input of all stakeholders , including aboriginals and non - aboriginal fishers who have an equally important stake in the outcome . 
given what the supreme court has handed down , given this dark abyss that is now before us , it does not just pertain to fisheries , as we have heard many times in the debate this evening . 
this goes far beyond one single industry . 
this is the tip of the iceberg and the government is steaming toward that iceberg unless it acts quickly . 
with the closing moments of the debate I implore the minister to continue on the road he is on , but to do so in a very pragmatic and measured way , and to listen to the stakeholders who are equally sincere and have the greatest stake in the resolution of the matter . 
i encourage him to do so with post - haste . 
we do support him in that and I sincerely wish him the very best in finding the solutions that will appease all of those who are looking for a peaceful resolution to the matter . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the comments of my colleagues who represent areas which are farther north of my riding in Nova Scotia . 
his previous colleague asked about the moratorium on the aboriginal fishery and he just said that what we require are peaceful negotiations in that regard . 
does he believe that if the government enforced a moratorium on the aboriginal aspects of the fishery that it would lead and be conducive to peaceful negotiations and dialogue with the non - native people ? 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously an even - handed approach is needed . 
one approach being suggested , that we would single out the aboriginals who have now been given this right by the supreme court and attempt to enforce it in a way that is unfettered , is unacceptable . 
obviously the minister is not about to single out one of the two groups in the divide . 
that I suggest would only lead to further confrontation and further violence . 
the difficulty is that this is a tinderbox that is absolutely on the verge of an explosion . 
i do not mean to restate the obvious , but the minister has to act quickly . 
this is something that is going to get out of control like wildfire in an instant . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
pursuant to order made earlier this day , it being 12 o ' clock midnight , the motion shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and the House shall adjourn . 
it being 12 o ' clock midnight the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
( the House adjourned at 12.00 a.m. )

competition ACT 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 201 , an act to amend the Competition Act ( protection of those who purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers who compete with them at retail ) . 
contrary to the belief of some , I would like to reiterate that rumours of the bill ' s death have been greatly exaggerated by the industry committee and others . 
the bill , along with the amendments to be put forward by my colleague , the hon. member for Cambridge , seeks to accomplish just one thing : to prohibit vertically integrated suppliers from charging their wholesale customers more for a product than what they or their affiliates are charging for the same product at the retail level . 
in terms of unjustifiable and high sustained prices , the bill tries to prevent market domination in the grocery and gas industries as well as others . 
i look forward to the continuing debate on this renewed bill . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is the hon. member suggesting the bill was in the same form as in the previous Parliament ? 
Mr. Dan McTeague : 
Mr. Speaker , the bill itself is a votable bill under the procedures that have been changed as a result of last year . 
the bill is in virtually the same form . 
it is in the same form as it was in the previous Parliament . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that the bill is in the same form as Bill C - 235 was at the time of the prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament . 
therefore , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the bill is deemed read the second time , referred to a committee , considered in committee , and reported with amendments .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 202 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( flight ) . 
i am sorry about monopolizing the time in the context of my former bill C - 235 . 
i thank the House leader for the Reform Party . 
the bill was presented in the last session . 
it deals with a specific provision in the Criminal Code dealing with those who evade police in pursuit . 
the bill provides severe penalties for anyone using a motor vehicle to escape from the police and in the process kills , injures or maims another person . 
over the summer Canadians once again saw the tragic outcome caused by those who use motor vehicles to evade the police . 
in Toronto another family no longer has a loved one . 
in Sudbury another police officer was added to the list of those killed in the line of duty . 
the bill has the support of the Minister of Justice , the Government of Ontario and the Canadian Police Association . 
i am confident that given its previous reception by the justice committee the bill will also obtain the support of the House in the very near future . 
the bill is in the same form as the previous bill in the last parliament . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that the bill is in the same form as Bill C - 440 was at the time of prorogation of the 1 st session of the 36 th parliament . 
accordingly , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) the bill is deemed read the second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights . 
( bill read the second time and referred to a committee )

auditor GENERAL ACT 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 203 , an act to amend the Auditor General Act ( Poverty Commissioner ) . 
the bill is the same in form as Bill C - 490 , which I introduced in the House of Commons during the preceding session . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is of the opinion that this bill is in the same form as Bill C - 490 was when the first session of the 36 th Parliament was prorogued . 
therefore , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the order for second reading of this bill will be placed at the bottom of the order of precedence in the Order Paper . 
* * * 
employment INSURANCE ACT 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 204 , an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act ( parental benefits ) . 
the 1996 national longitudinal survey on children and youth found that 25 % of Canadian children enter adult life with significant emotional , behavioural , academic or social problems . 
the bill responds in part to the need to provide more flexibility , options and choices to parents by amending the Employment Insurance Act to provide up to one full year of maternity and parental leave benefits under that act . 
i am pleased to reintroduce the bill and I hope we will have the support of the entire House .

income TAX ACT 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 205 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( deduction of expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in employment ) . 
this bill is at the same stage and in the same form as was Bill C - 502 at the time of prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament , and I am requesting that it be reinstated in the order of precedence . 
i would remind hon. members that this bill was a votable item . 
i would remind the government House leader that , in the rather chaotic end of session last June 10 , I had to cut 20 minutes off my speech . 
he had then given me his consent to have another 20 minutes to speak . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the chair is of the opinion that this bill is at the same stage as was Bill C - 502 at the time the first session of the 36 th Parliament was prorogued . 
consequently , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the order for second reading of this bill will be placed at the bottom of the order of precedence in the Order Paper and it will be designated as a votable item .

access TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 206 , an act to amend the Access to Information Act and to make amendments to other acts . 
what it does is substantially reforms the Access to Information Act . 
i have 112 seconders to this bill , mainly from the Liberals , the Reform and the Bloc Quebecois . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to introduce the former Bill C - 461 , an act to amend the Criminal Code to prohibit coercion in medical procedures that offend a person ' s religion or belief that human life is inviolable . 
the seconder for the bill is the hon. member for Huron - Bruce . 
the purpose of the bill is to ensure that health providers working in medical facilities of various kinds will never be forced to participate against their wills in procedures such as abortions or acts of euthanasia . 
the bill itself does not ban abortion or euthanasia , but it makes it illegal to force another person to participate in an abortion procedure or an act of euthanasia . 
incredibly there are medical personnel in Canada who have been fired because the law is not explicit enough in spelling out their conscience rights . 
the bill will make those rights explicit .

crown LIABILITY AND PROCEEDINGS ACT 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to reintroduce this bill . 
its purpose is to ensure that a person serving time in prison will not be able to sue the federal government or its employees under any federal legislation in respect of a claim arising while the person is under sentence . 
if enacted , the bill would put an end to the practice of prisoners engaging in frivolous lawsuits against the federal government and their abuse of the legal system . 
i urge all members in the House to give serious consideration to the bill . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

criminal CODE 
it would thus make it a criminal offence for an adult to engage in sex with children under the age of 16 . 
the bill was first introduced in 1996 and reintroduced in 1997 . 
however , the growing concern over child pornography and child prostitution in the country makes it even more urgent for the enactment of this legislation to protect the young and vulnerable in our society from predators among us . 
for the sake of our children I appeal to members of the House to give serious consideration to the bill and lend their support accordingly .

income TAX ACT 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 211 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( travel expenses for a motor vehicle used by a forestry worker ) . 
this legislation seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to allow a reasonable tax deduction for forestry workers who work far from their place of residence , so that the Income Tax Act is an incentive to work and not the reverse . 
this bill is in response to a request made by several forestry workers in my riding and in my region . 
these people deserve to be encouraged . 
when a person agrees to travel 300 , 400 , 500 or 600 kilometres to make a living , it is normal that the government should grant a corresponding deduction .

Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 212 , an act to amend the Canada Labour Code , the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act , and the Public Service Staff Relations Act ( prohibited provision in a collective agreement ) . 
the bill ' s purpose is to prohibit clauses in collective agreements that discriminate against new arrivals in the labour market and to ensure that these workers enjoy the same pay and benefits as previously hired workers .

Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 213 , an act to promote shipbuilding , 1999 . 
basically , it consists of three measures : a loan guarantee program specific to shipbuilding ; a leasing write - off provision ; a shipbuilding tax credit similar to the one that already exists in Quebec . 
these three measures were proposed two years ago by the Canadian shipbuilders ' association and had the support of the interunion coalition of 4,000 shipbuilding workers in Canada .

business OF THE HOUSE 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) moved : 
that , during the first thirty sitting days of the present Session of Parliament , whenever a Minister of the Crown , when proposing a motion for first reading of a public bill , states that the said bill is in the same form as a bill introduced by a Minister of the Crown in the previous session , if the Speaker is satisfied that the said bill is in the same form as at prorogation , notwithstanding Standing Order 71 , the said bill shall be deemed in the current session to have been considered and approved at all stages completed at the time of prorogation of the previous session . 
i would then later ask for two other motions to be put as well . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
does the House give its unanimous consent to proceed in the manner outlined by the government House leader ?

petitions 
gasoline ADDITIVES 
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I wish to present a petition which has been certified correct as to form and content . 
the petitioners are from the Grand Bend and London areas . 
the petition states that the use of the additive MMT in Canadian gasoline presents an environmental problem affecting every man , woman and child in Canada . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to set by the end of this calendar year national clean fuel standards for gasoline with zero MMT and low sulphur content . 
the CONSTITUTION 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to table a petition incited by the hon. member of the New Democratic Party as being a problem in this country . 
the petitioners ask the House that parliament oppose any amendments to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or any other federal legislation which will provide for the exclusion of reference to the supremacy of God in our Constitution and laws . 
the petitioners also mention that the majority of Canadians believe in the God who created heaven and earth and are not offended by the mention of his name in the preamble of the charter of rights and freedoms . 
this is tabled for the attention of the House and for the attention of the hon. member of the NDP who created this mess in the first place . 
agriculture 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to table that are of the same nature with respect to agriculture . 
there are 122 pages of signatures .

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 52 I request leave to make a motion for adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration . 
over the summer months it became evident that a crisis exists in our immigration and refugee determination system . 
canada has become a primary target for illegal migration . 
this is causing a problem with queue jumping . 
people who are using the normal process are extremely concerned that their process is being held up as a result of poor handling of the refugee determination process by the government . 
there are three recent events I would like to quickly refer to which demonstrate the need for an emergency debate . 
i do not think it is acceptable in a country like Canada to have a system that is working so poorly that people are being detained for months and years while they await the outcome of the determination process . 
second , Mayor Lastman , the mayor of Toronto , Canada ' s largest city , has publicly expressed concern about our immigration system , in particular our refugee determination system which is working so poorly that it is putting an extra cost burden on his city . 
he wants the government rather than the city to bear that burden if the government is not going to fix the system . 
third , yesterday , according to media reports the premier of Ontario has written a letter to the government and to the immigration minister saying he is fed up with the system working so poorly . 
he wants the government to fix the system because his province cannot bear the costs . 
it is important that we debate this issue immediately to send a signal to people smugglers and those who would use their services that Canada will no longer be an easy mark . 
we must put in place legislation that will make this process happen within days and weeks rather than months and years as is currently the situation and which will quickly end the virtual slave trade that is building in our country . 
people smugglers are bringing people in illegally and putting them into slave - like conditions . 
that is something Canadians cannot accept . 
for those reasons , it is important that we have an emergency debate today to change the law to fix these problems . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair appreciates the intervention of the hon. member for Lakeland . 
it is the view of the Chair that his application for an emergency debate does not meet the exigencies of the standing order at this time . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
during the remainder of the debate on the Speech from the Throne the Reform Party members will be dividing their speaking time . 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for Parkdale - High Park . 
as in the last six years , Canada continues to be the UN ' s choice as the number one country in which to live . 
this week ' s throne speech set out a strategy that will ensure we maintain our number one ranking . 
it signalled the government ' s plan to build on the quality of life for all Canadians . 
in the years to come we will address the challenges of globalization and the demands placed on a knowledge based society . 
we have committed to bring down the personal income tax levels of Canadians and to invest in families and in children . 
the government has set out a plan that addresses our diversity and responds to our responsibilities as a global leader . 
today I will take some time to explore this throne speech and how it relates to my riding and the constituents of Kitchener Centre . 
first I would like to review the government ' s record . 
let me begin with unemployment rates . 
they are at their lowest level since 1990 . 
i am pleased to report to this House that the Waterloo region has the lowest unemployment rate among municipal centres across the nation , a rate of 4.9 % . 
we have consistently increased our investments in research and technology and we have supported small and medium size enterprises . 
in my community Industry Canada has worked in partnership on the creation of the business enterprise centre which houses the Canada - Ontario Business Service Centre . 
this centre provides one stop shopping for entrepreneurs . 
users of the centre have access to extensive and current information and tools which enable them to both succeed and grow . 
the region of Waterloo is a microcosm of the changes that are happening across the nation . 
a generation ago no one could have envisaged a vibrant local economy that lacked the kind of family businesses such as Seagram ' s and Labatt ' s , nor could they have imagined the changes that we have seen at Schneider ' s meats , yet these changes have occurred . 
today in Kitchener we see an ever increasing number of small businesses starting up . 
across the country over 80 % of the new jobs created are by this sector and many are in the high tech area . 
Waterloo region has seen incredible growth in the high tech sector . 
our community has not only thrived but remained on the cutting edge of a competitive global economy . 
this week ' s throne speech clearly indicates a strong commitment to building our economy through developing a skilled labour force and providing the necessary research dollars and tools for small emerging companies . 
the Liberal government will ensure that skilled development keeps pace with the evolving industries and markets . 
this will be accomplished through the sectoral councils in close consultation with industry leaders . 
the government has once again acknowledged the importance of foreign investors in Canada . 
for Canada ' s technology triangle this is good news . 
the CTT has been funded by the federal government to attract foreign investors to areas such as Kitchener . 
they are working and spreading the news about Canada . 
it is this type of organization with which we must encourage and foster relationships . 
we must also support companies that will help us meet our environmental obligations under agreements such as the Kyoto protocol . 
our environment is also affected by our infrastructure . 
as a former regional and municipal representative I have witnessed the benefits of working in partnership on programs such as our national physical infrastructure . 
in the throne speech we have indicated our will to continue to work with all levels of government and the private sector to achieve a five year plan for improving the infrastructure in both urban and rural areas across Canada . 
this will be a commitment that will be reached by the end of the year 2000 . 
children and youth are the country ' s key to success in the 21 st century . 
it is the responsibility of government and community , family , friends and teachers to open doors and encourage young people to seize their dreams . 
i first entered politics to assure that the decisions of government were working in the best interests of my four children . 
during my 10 years as a member of parliament I have taken special interest in the youth of Kitchener . 
through visits to classrooms and graduations , I have had the pleasure to meet the young people who will be the leaders of tomorrow . 
i have been pleased to support organizations such as the KOR Gallery and art studio . 
this studio was created by another mother who wanted to see the greatest opportunities possible for her very talented son and other young artists in the Waterloo region . 
KOR Gallery has been supported by the federal government and has received half a million dollars throughout its years . 
in the spring of this year the Prime Minister ' s task force on youth entrepreneurship spent a day in my community meeting with young entrepreneurs and visiting their businesses . 
the task force heard that our youth need support to gain access to funding and resources . 
we are responding to those requests . 
our goal is to give today ' s young generation of Canadians , no matter where they live , the tools and the opportunities for personal success in the knowledge economy . 
we will provide them with career information and access to work experience and learning . 
we will hire them to work on Internet projects . 
we will offer them the opportunity to apply their talents overseas through youth international internship programs . 
for example , this past summer Kitchener was the proud host of the skills Canada competition . 
the event , in connection with two other competitions , received $ 800,000 from the youth employment strategy fund . 
skills Canada is an important project because it gives our youth the opportunity to compete with young people from around the world . 
the competition tested participants in over 40 trade , technological and other skill areas . 
i can think of no better way to encourage tomorrow ' s leaders . 
our children and our families deserve a high standard of living . 
this will require , as never before , an adaptable , resilient population that is ready to learn throughout life . 
it is clear that the foundation for such capacities is laid in the very early years of life . 
i firmly believe that the strength of our society will depend on the investments we make today as a nation in families and in children . 
the government has committed to making a third significant investment in the national child benefit by the year 2002 . 
we will put more dollars in the hands of families with children through further tax relief . 
we will lengthen and make more flexible employment insurance benefits for parental leave . 
we have been responding to these areas in the past years and we will continue to be committed to these issues . 
this nation has a high quality of life . 
it is a nation of which we should be proud . 
it is a nation that others envy . 
our Prime Minister has provided us with a strong direction and an unwavering commitment for unity . 
the new millennium will be wonderful for all Canadians . 
the new millennium will be a bright one for all Canadians . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with all the fluff that flies around here it is a wonder we do not break out with allergies . 
i wonder if the member has ever visited the reserves across our country , as I have for the last two years , to see the quality of life . 
the government continually talks about how wonderful we are in this land . 
i wonder if the member of parliament has ever walked the streets of Toronto , Vancouver or other major cities and visited with the people who are on the streets , who are homeless , who are experiencing this wonderful quality of life we keep hearing about from this minister . 
i wonder if the member and the government recognize the extreme value of Mike Harris , Ralph Klein and other premiers , and how much they have contributed and sacrificed in order to make things happen in their provinces , with no thanks to this government . 
in spite of the government , they have managed to achieve many things . 
i wonder if the member is aware that only this morning it was declared that there has been a 66 % increase in poverty in one year . 
one out of every six children is going to school hungry . 
one year ago it was not that bad . 
i wonder if the member is proud of a government that spends money to hang dead rabbits in a museum or to form a committee to study whether we should have a national insect . 
the government is doing all this funny fuzzy spending while we get these kinds of reports . 
what kind of a record is that ? 
what are the member and the government going to do about these things that are real and actual , that are happening on our reserves and on the streets of our country ? 
we talk about the quality of life while we hang dead rabbits in museums and search for a national insect . 
when is the government going to wake up , and what is the member going to do about it ? 
Mrs. Karen Redman : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the member opposite for the temporary promotion to minister . 
i had the pleasure this past summer of going to the Arctic region and the Northwest Territories of this land and was very proud to see the process in place for self - government . 
as recently as last April we saw the creation of Nunavut . 
i will tell the member that the government is working very hard with our aboriginal people , who do not speak with one voice , to come up with self - government and empower them to use their voices to create what the next century will look like for them . 
i also point out for the member opposite , if he would like to look at the Speech from the Throne , that there is reference made to the social union . 
one of the things that the social union does is allow all levels of government , with the leadership of the federal government , to stop pointing fingers at each other and to engage in solutions of the kind the Minister of Labour has heard in communities as she crossed Canada looking at the homelessness issue and looking at a variety of ways that all governments can work together to solve this problem . 
it is a national concern of the government , but not one that merely demands having money thrown at it . 
the social union structure allows Canadians to hold all levels of government accountable . 
the one thing the government will not do is risk financial gains by having a balanced financial picture and dressing down the deficit . 
we will not run deficits to give tax cuts , which is happening in Ontario . 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pride that I rise today in the House of Commons as a member of the government to address the Speech from the Throne , a speech which I can proudly say has been heralded as a return to traditional Liberalism . 
i would like to thank our new governor general for her eloquent delivery of the Speech from the Throne and I congratulate her on her appointment . 
the Government of Canada cannot undertake this strategy alone . 
it can only do so in partnership and in collaboration , by working together with other governments , the provinces and the territories , the private sector , the volunteer sector and individuals . 
in fact , there is not a page in the Speech from the Throne which does not note the importance of working together or use the words " collaboration " or " partnership '' . 
at the very beginning of the Speech from the Throne it is stated unequivocally as follows : 
the best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians . 
as a passionate advocate of Canada ' s arts and culture and as the member of parliament for a constituency which is home to many of Canada ' s artists , including writers , singers , actors , performers , filmmakers and producers , I had started to hear concerns that investments in Canada ' s culture had become stagnant , that other interests and interest groups had overshadowed the importance of a continued investment in the arts. 
i was actually confronted with concerns that the last two budgets had not addressed any new programs or incentives for our arts and cultural sectors , save and except those programs which had been envisaged in red book II , the Liberal election platform . 
while those programs and funding proposals had indeed been implemented , the fact still remained that these were not new commitments . 
where was the vision for this sector that would lead Canada into the next century and ensure our cultural sovereignty and our national identity ? 
the concerns voiced by the arts community have been addressed and I applaud the government on its vision and leadership in continuing to promote our Canadian arts and cultural sectors . 
the following are the themes that I trust will reassure and enhance our arts and cultural communities . 
the government is now committed to ensuring that younger Canadians , from age 13 , are given an opportunity to apply their creative abilities by providing them with a chance to produce their first works using traditional approaches and new technologies in the arts , cultural , digital and other industries . 
this commitment acknowledges the importance of arts in making children creative and preparing them for a knowledge based economy . 
there is substantial empirical evidence to show that children who are exposed to the arts , especially music , at a very early age score much higher on the math and science components of the SAT examinations than those who are not exposed . 
in November 1997 an article appeared on the front page of the arts section of the Globe and Mail which confirmed this evidence and concluded that arts , not computers , make kids creative . 
the article stated : 
arts education is not only cheaper , it may be essential training for a more creative flexible world . 
arts , not IBM , makes kids smarter . 
the article also went on to say that arts education by focusing on the creative process prepares our youth for the highly skilled jobs that our country requires and will require in the future . 
this statement gives new meaning and life to the maxim that culture is a third pillar of our foreign policy . 
the government also committed to use the upcoming WTO negotiations to build a more transparent rules based trading system which not only provides for better access in world markets for Canadian companies in all sectors but also respects the needs of Canadians , especially culture as is noted . 
it will put collections from the National Archives , the National Library and other key institutions on line . 
specifically the speech also notes and vows to increase support for the production of Canadian stories and images in print , theatre , film , music and video , and the government has committed to increase support for the use of new media . 
in dealing with physical infrastructure the government has agreed that it will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach agreement on a five year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural communities across the country . 
one of the areas of focus specifically noted for physical infrastucture was culture . 
in the city of Toronto plans are under way to build a new state of the art opera house . 
in Winnipeg the Manitoba Theatre Centre , at 41 years of age and Canada ' s oldest English speaking regional theatre , is in desperate need of repair . 
this need has also launched a private sector campaign to refurbish its two buildings . 
this theme brings new hope to a request by the cultural community to restore funding for the arts in general and infrastructure matters in particular . 
more important , this commitment to improve physical infrastructure for culture appears to be a direct response to recommendations 32 and 33 of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage report entitled " A Sense of Place , A Sense of Being : 
the Evolving Role of the Federal Government in Support of Culture in Canada '' , which was tabled in the House of Commons in June . 
these recommendations call upon the Government of Canada to re - establish a capital fund and a long term financial strategy to deal with Canada ' s deteriorating cultural facilities . 
i applaud the government for its quick response to the committee ' s report . 
in the section of the Speech from the Throne entitled " Canada ' s Place in the World '' , the government stated that it would act like like - minded countries to reform and strengthen international institutions such as the World Trade Organization . 
it also specifically noted that it would work to develop a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world . 
this commitment is a direct endorsement of the report of the cultural industries sectoral advisory group dated February 1999 wherein it was recommended that the government champion a new cultural trade covenant , a new international instrument that would lay out the ground rules for cultural policy . 
in addition , this commitment to a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression also is a direct response to recommendation 29 of the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade entitled " Canada and the Future of the World Trade Organization : 
advancing a Millennium Agenda in the Public Interest '' , tabled in the House of Commons in June . 
recommendation 29 specifically calls upon the government to pursue the policy alternative contained in the cultural SAGIT report for a new international instrument on cultural diversity . 
again I applaud the government for its quick response to the report and for the commitment to implement this recommendation . 
all Canadians , every citizen , every government , every business and every community organization , have a part to play . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a lot of time for the hon. member and I appreciate her commitment to the arts. 
it is very heart warming . 
however I would like to know what the member thinks about what the federal government actually does with its so - called investments , that is to say wasteful spending in arts and culture . 
what does the hon. member think of the quarter of a million dollar investment of the minister of heritage in Bubbles Galore ? 
does she think the federal government ' s cultural agenda should include producing pornographic films ? 
what does she think about Hanging the Dead Rabbits ? 
does she think that is an important investment in the cultural future of Canada in the 21 st century ? 
does she think that is necessary to defend our cultural sovereignty ? 
a few years ago , in part through a federal grant , the Vancouver Art Gallery exhibited something called Piss Pope , a picture of the Holy Father submerged in a jar of the artist ' s urine . 
that was another expenditure by the federal government of our tax dollars . 
we could go on and on and on about the kind of absurd , disgusting , wasteful excuse for art which the government finances . 
how does the hon. member apologize for that ? 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte : 
Mr. Speaker , the opposition member has reported some instances of what he calls wasteful expenditure . 
i must say that I see any kind of expenditure in our art and cultural industries as an investment . 
it is an investment in who we are and what we are . 
everyone does not have the same taste but culture and art is a wide - ranging sector . 
it gives us a sense of place and a sense of being , as the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage so eloquently put it . 
i recommend to my hon. colleague that he actually take a look at that report and at the recommendations made by that committee . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there must be many Canadians who voted for the Liberal Party that are feeling pretty embarrassed right now that the member would stand to defend the disgusting display of art or excuse for art that was just talked about by my colleague from Calgary . 
the Liberal member stood to defend spending on that trash that she refers to as art and a good investment . 
she owes Canadians a huge apology for her confirmation that taxpayers dollars were spent on that kind of disgusting culture and art , as she referred to it . 
she probably owes an apology to some of her colleagues that were not very pleased with her response to the member from Calgary . 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to support the government and the Minister of Canadian Heritage on continuing investment in the arts and cultural industries in our country . 
they are not only a vital part of our economic growth but , as I have said time and time again , they are an investment in who we are , what we are , our identity and our cultural sovereignty . 
let us never forget that arts and culture sovereignty is inextricably involved with our economic sovereignty . 
i am proud to be a member of the government and to support its commitment to arts and culture . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to speak to the throne speech today and to be back with colleagues on this side of the House . 
in response to the hon. member who just spoke , it is contrary to what most Canadians believe when she suggests that they should have their tax money forcibly taken from them and given to projects which are completely contrary to their values , the things they believe in . 
some people have very strong religious beliefs , for instance . 
it is completely wrong and I believe most Canadians think it is completely wrong when their tax dollars are forcibly taken to devote to things those people would consider to be blasphemous . 
that is exactly what the Liberal government does , and I cannot believe it sits there and defends it . 
at the beginning of a year most people sit down to make some new year resolutions . 
when they have the resources to do that , that is exactly what they do . 
as the government moves into not only a new year but a new decade , a new century , and a new millennium , I would think it would want to do that too . 
it should want to make a special effort to set about reforming how it does things . 
i would argue , and I think most Canadians would agree with me when I say it , there are many areas where the government is simply not doing a good job . 
it is not doing a good job in providing national defence . 
it is not doing a good job in our justice system . 
there is lots of room for improvement in the delivery of health care and social services . 
it is not doing a good job in ensuring that government is accountable . 
it was a lot of tinkering , and that certainly characterizes this administration . 
when we wipe away all the rhetoric in the 24 page throne speech , what are we left with ? 
we are left with an announcement that the government will make an announcement about tax relief at some point in the future . 
we are also left with a whole slew of tax increases which are coming our way very soon . 
on January 1 we will see a payroll tax hike because Canada pension plan taxes are going up once again . 
we will see small business face a tax increase because their small business exemption will be eroded by inflation . 
they will pay more in taxes . 
it will be the same for the small business capital gains exemption and for farmers and their capital gains exemption . 
that will mean a tax increase for all those people . 
that is the reality . 
all this talk that we hear on the other side about how much the government cares about taxes really does not amount to a whole lot when we look at what it will actually do . 
it will raise taxes . 
the government talks about its plan to cut taxes . 
we will hear about that in the next few days . 
it is to reduce taxes by $ 16.5 billion , but it does not say at the same time that it is raising taxes by over $ 18 billion . 
the net result is that Canadians who now face the highest taxes in Canadian history will face even higher taxes thanks to the finance minister and the Liberal government . 
that is wrong . 
it is wrong for a couple of reasons . 
first and probably most important , it is wrong because it hurts people . 
if the government really were compassionate and wanted to be fair and provide people with options and opportunities , it would have devoted the first 12 pages of the throne speech to explaining how it would deliver tax relief to help hard - pressed Canadians . 
it is unbelievable that we stagger under this tremendous tax burden today where families who earn less than $ 20,000 a year are paying $ 6 billion a year in taxes . 
my friend from Crowfoot told me not long ago about a woman and in fact I saw her income tax return . 
she made $ 11,000 and paid $ 600 in federal income tax . 
that is shameful and that party claims to be compassionate . 
we have raised many examples in this place of people who make extraordinarily low incomes and pay extraordinarily high taxes . 
i could go through some examples but I want to talk for a moment about an example presented to me yesterday by my friend from North Vancouver . 
he gave me a letter from a woman whose husband makes $ 65,000 a year , which is a pretty good salary in most people ' s minds . 
the result is the family has to take one car off the road . 
they simply cannot put aside enough money to help them get through what will be a layoff period for this man . 
it is very disturbing when a person makes $ 65,000 and he can barely make it because of the tax burden imposed by the government . 
i happened to be looking through some documents which were confidential until we received them through access to information a little while ago . 
even the minister ' s own briefing notes acknowledge that Canada has by far the highest tax burden in the entire G - 7 . 
out of all of our trading partners , out of all of the most prosperous nations in the world , we have by far the highest personal income taxes . 
i always find it amazing that in Canada today people pay more in taxes than they spend on food , shelter and clothing combined . 
when we add all of that up , it does not leave much left over . 
when all those taxes are paid and money is spent on the bare necessities of life , there is very little left over . 
that is why we are in a position in Canada today where we have seen disposable incomes mired at 1980 levels . 
for 20 years we have had our disposable incomes mired at that 1980 level . 
there was much airy talk in the throne speech about Internet programs and acting as a big travel agency for young people and sending them around . 
that is really nice but it is not a luxury we can afford today , not when Canadians are staggering under that level of taxation . 
it is ridiculous . 
if the government were really fair , it would acknowledge that it was Canadians who balanced that budget for it . 
does the House realize that the average family today is paying taxes 30 % higher than it was six years ago ? 
that is $ 4,300 , a staggering number . 
it is not the finance minister nor the government that balanced the budget ; it was balanced on the backs of taxpayers . 
fairness decrees that they should now get some tax relief . 
i want to speak just a little bit about the situation on the farm today . 
i come from a farm riding . 
i want to talk about how taxes hurt farmers . 
do hon. members realize that taxes are embedded in just about every input they can think of ? 
fuel taxes take up about 50 % of the price of fuel . 
on fertilizer and chemicals and machinery , taxes take up 15 % , 20 % to 30 % of the price of those things . 
if we could lower taxes we could help people in a direct way on the farm , but we do not see that coming from this government . 
in conclusion , I simply want to say that the fairest way to treat Canadians as we go into the next millennium is to lower their tax burden . 
they will take those resources and use them to help their families and to help children , which is something that the government claims it is concerned about . 
Canadians will use those resources to help their friends and their neighbours and to strengthen their own situation . 
ultimately , I think most Canadians would agree that a dollar left in the hands of the taxpayer will be a lot better utilized than a dollar left in the hands of a politician or a bureaucrat . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague , the Reform Party finance critic , for his excellent presentation in debate today . 
i would like him to centre in on one thing which I think is of a huge concern to Canadian families . 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to address that question from my colleague from Prince George - Bulkley Valley . 
the fact is that Canadians have seen their disposable income stuck at 1980 levels . 
for the things the government claims it cares about most , for instance children , it means that children are put in a terrible position . 
not long ago I received a letter which had been passed on to me by the member for Cariboo - Chilcotin . 
in that letter a young woman explained that because of the EI rate of this government and the fact that people were not getting those employment insurance premiums back , she could not afford to put her young son into hockey . 
that is the sort of thing that happens on a day to day basis across the country . 
it was not very long ago when the leader of the Reform Party brought a family from New Brunswick to Ottawa and explained what the Reform plan of reducing taxes would do for that family . 
about $ 3,000 would go back to that family . 
we actually gave them that money . 
what did they use it on ? 
they also used it to pay back an RRSP that they had to cash in to pay their tax bill . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it has become quite clear that the Liberal Party , the Government of Canada , is using a new code word for its favourite thing to do which is spending , and that word is investment . 
i would like my hon. colleague ' s comments on this word investment . 
could he tell us what that really means in terms of government spending ? 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
it tries to cover it up by calling it investment . 
frankly , it is obscene what it does with some of the money but a lot of it is just serious waste . 
that money could be used for things that the government claims it cares about . 
what is a higher priority , spending money on pornographic films or providing hospital beds ? 
or should it be used to provide tax relief for Canadian families who are struggling ? 
should we be giving grants to big business or should we be using that money to ensure that children in Canada have a proper education ? 
those are the sorts of things that are priorities , not grants to special interest groups , big business and ridiculous campaigns to impose certain cultural values on other Canadians using their tax money . 
it is time the government came clean and simply explained to people that really its intention is not to use that money wisely but to spend it frivolously in too many cases . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted to rise on debate on Her Excellency ' s Speech from the Throne . 
as the member for Parkdale - High Park said in her articulate defence of anti - Catholic government funded pornographic art , this budget was filled with all kinds of marvellous Liberal - style investments . 
it was a return to old fashioned liberalism , namely the arrogance of a tax and spend philosophy which believes that politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa know better how to spend a scarce dollar than do a homemaker , a small business person , an entrepreneur or a taxpayer . 
that is the philosophy of the Speech from the Throne which we heard earlier this week . 
the government devoted a couple of words in the speech to some token talk about tax relief , but it also said that the government has already cut taxes . 
we know we cannot believe the completely specious commitment to tax relief from the government given the fact that it has not yet delivered any tax relief . 
in fact what it has delivered are tax increases . 
it is tax grief for Canada , not tax relief . 
if the government has lowered taxes , then why is it bringing $ 40 billion more into the federal treasury than it was six years ago ? 
while virtually every other G - 7 economy lowered its personal income tax burden over the last 15 years , Canada ' s rose sharply , both as a percentage of GDP and of household income '' . 
but we do not have to quote the experts or look at the stats that the government ignores because we do not have to make this case to Canadians . 
they know when they get their paycheques . 
they know when they look at their pay stubs that they are going home with less than they did in 1993 when this government came into power with a pledge never to raise taxes . 
i remember the Prime Minister saying when he was asked if he would raise taxes , " Well , I can ' t rule it out , there might be a war or something '' . 
well there has been a war . 
it has been a war on Canadian taxpayers and they are paying more than they ever have before . 
that is the ultimate measurement by the international markets of the value of our economy , of our currency and it ultimately reflects the fiscal policy of the government . 
the Liberal government loves to bash the United States . 
the United States has its fair share of problems , but I do not think we should take pride in becoming poorer as they become richer . 
i do not think we should take pride in what the Minister of Industry said last February , that had Canadian productivity , competitiveness and growth kept pace with that of the United States over the past two decades the average family in Canada would be $ 28,000 a year better off . 
that is apparently the moral high ground that the government takes in its posturing and its bashing of an economy which is growing much faster than our own . 
i spent all four weeks of September in nine of the ten provinces and in nearly 30 communities speaking to business people , entrepreneurs , chambers of commerce and small business folks . 
i was on university campuses and in high schools . 
again and again in every region of the country I heard that we have a huge and growing drain of talent and entrepreneurialism out of this country , not just to the United States but to other more competitive , faster growing and lower tax jurisdictions . 
this summer the Conference Board of Canada released a major study wherein it indicated that the number of Canadians who are going to the United States increased from 17,000 in 1986 to over 98,000 in 1997 . 
the government denies it . 
the Liberals put their heads in the sand and say the problem does not exist . 
why then is it that nearly 70 % of our computer science graduates are now leaving this country ? 
these people will be creating untold future wealth and economic opportunity , and contributing to a tax base to finance health care , education and pensions . 
we want these people here , contributing to our tax base so that we can afford to pay down the debt , to grow the economy , to pay for health care and to pay for a civil society . 
we are literally eating away at the productive capacity of our economy . 
i was on a university campus this summer where 120 of the 130 kids who graduated from computer science last year took placements outside Canada because they could not find economic opportunities here . 
the capital was not here to invest and create new cutting edge , information technology businesses and economic opportunities for those kids . 
every one of those kids who has left the country represents the hopes and dreams of Canadian families who believed that if they worked hard , played by the rules , paid their taxes and invested in their children ' s education they would see their children and grandchildren raised happily and in prosperity in Canada . 
what do we have instead ? 
we have thousands and thousands of broken dreams because of the broken economy delivered by this government ' s high tax , high regulatory , high debt , high spending policies . 
that is our top priority . 
we want to relieve those people entirely of their tax obligations , which finance government investments like Bubbles Galore . 
reformers also believe it is critically important that we generate new investment and capital formation to create opportunities for those young people who are leaving today , as well as to cut the insidious tax on wealth creation called the capital gains tax . 
the United States is not going to stop there . 
the chairman of the federal reserve , the leading economic authority in the world today , has called on Congress twice publicly to eliminate the American capital gains taxes , as has been done in Ireland , Hong Kong and so many other jurisdictions . 
how can we believe that we can retain capital in this country to create wealth , jobs and quality of living as long as we have this enormous and growing differential ? 
the finance minister knows perfectly well that if he did not increase spending , as he plans to do , we would see surpluses of about $ 25 billion a year within five years . 
that is not all . 
every jurisdiction in the world that has cut tax rates has seen revenues grow . 
the United States cut its taxes in 1962 and in 1982 , its high marginal rates and capital gains rates . 
in both instances it saw an explosion in revenues from those sources . 
right here at home , of course , Mike Harris and his common sense revolution cut income taxes by 30 % and saw a massive growth in revenues from the income tax . 
the moral of the story is that tax cuts are necessary to grow the economy . 
the government says we have to wait for growth before we can cut taxes . 
we will never get to that kind of real growth if we wait to cut taxes . 
it is time that we got our priorities right . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to compliment the hon. member and the hon. member who spoke before him on their fine presentations . 
what they were stating is intrinsically true . 
those regimes which have low taxes have high growth and the chance to create growth and wealth . 
from 1992 to 1997 taxes have increased 15 % as a percentage of income for Canadian families , to the extent that they now spend more money on personal income taxes than they do on food , clothing or household operations . 
given that fact , if the government really wants to develop a children ' s agenda and it wants to invest in and enhance institutions that invest in the betterment of children , why does it not invest in the institution that has proven to be successful for children , that being the Canadian family ? 
if the government really wants to enhance the welfare of children in the country , why does it not provide the tax relief to Canadian families that they so earnestly deserve ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the hon. member ' s question . 
i can only assume that the answer is that the members of the Liberal government honestly believe , and I grant them that they believe this sincerely in their little red Liberal hearts , that they and their bureaucrats here in Ottawa know better how to spend an extra buck than a taxpayer in Fundy - Royal or Calgary Southeast . 
that is fundamentally what drives the philosophy of this throne speech and this government . 
it is a philosophy which has been abandoned by virtually every other government of the developed world . 
let us take again the case of Ireland . 
it had a subsidy drenched subsistence economy with the highest taxes in Europe , whose only major export was its young people . 
they could have kind of moped along and said " Oh , well , we politicians and bureaucrats are going to keep on subsidizing , raising taxes and intervening in the economy '' , but they had the courage to do something different . 
they took a risk . 
they cut their capital gains taxes . 
what they saw was a massive explosion in that economy , so that now 20 % of the direct investment in Europe is going to a country with only 1 % of Europe ' s population . 
they became the second largest software exporter in the world . 
Ireland ' s population is now growing for the first time in 150 years . 
i cannot hesitate to remind my colleague from Fundy - Royal that , unfortunately , it was his party ' s government which oversaw the largest decrease in after tax disposable income in modern Canadian economic history because of its 72 tax increases , but I will not mention that . 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York North , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted that the member opposite has raised the issue of the Tory tax increases that we all had to suffer through in the 1980 s . 
however , there was a group of Canadians who enjoyed some tax reductions . 
those are some of the wealthiest Canadians in this country . 
as someone who lives in the province of Ontario , I hear all this talk about the united alternative , uniting options on the right and tax cutters for the rich . 
the only thing they are interested in doing is cutting taxes for the rich . 
they do not care about the health and the well - being of families in this country . 
they do not care about the struggles of the lower income classes . 
it is a farce when they talk about cutting taxes . 
what they are really talking about is making more money available for their rich friends , whether their rich friends are in Calgary or in Fundy - Royal . 
i ask the member opposite if indeed he was willing to join in the hands of friendship and ideology with members of the Conservative Party as it slashed the taxes of the rich and made the poor continue to pay ? 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , this coming from a member whose government takes $ 6 billion a year from people earning under $ 20,000 a year . 
it is a government that gives billions of dollars of subsidies away to its big business friends like Bombardier . 
when I hear the millionaires who populate the front bench of the government talk about concern for the poor , whom they put on the tax rolls and from whom they extract billions of dollars , it is a little bit disingenuous . 
maybe it is time the millionaires on the front bench of the government paid their share . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am absolutely delighted to inform the House that I will be sharing my time with the Ciceronian orator from Mississauga West . 
i am privileged and pleased to stand in my place to speak on behalf of all constituents of the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke to make a reply to that carefully crafted , compassionate , caring 1999 throne speech . 
last night I had the privilege of having the Minister of Finance appear at a function in my riding . 
i might add that he braved rather stormy weather to make it up to the Petawawa Civic Centre . 
when he spoke , and he spoke very eloquently , he thanked the many people of the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , in the upper Ottawa valley , for everything they have done in the last 150 years to make Canada the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
i looked around the room to see some of the people who were participating in this rather auspicious event . 
there were 10 other members of parliament who attended . 
some of them are here in the House as we speak . 
as a matter of fact , some of them were from the opposition . 
i must say , unequivocally , that I agreed with the Minister of Finance that he had definitely hit the nail on the head . 
what the throne speech effectively did was tell the Canadian people that the government has done a great job . 
we hope that it continues to do so as we continue to build the country to greatness . 
i looked around the room and at a table was my 83 year old father , Hector Sr . , who has a grade four education . 
i know the hon. member for Calgary Southeast wanted to talk about people with money . 
i will be the first to admit that my father has money . 
i have nothing . 
i do not even have hair . 
at one time he had two lumber camps on the go with 125 men in each camp . 
he paid his dues . 
he is a good French Canadian Catholic married to an Irish lassie . 
at that same table sat the two aunts of our current finance minister . 
i will not divulge their ages but my father apparently took one of the finance minister ' s aunts out on a date many years ago . 
what is interesting to note is that our finance minister ' s father , the late Paul Martin Sr . , was born and raised in Pembroke . 
he went to school and launched his political career in Pembroke . 
the hon. members opposite can talk about being American wannabes , but what do the Americans cherish most about Canada ? 
they cherish our valued health care system , our medicare . 
Paul Martin Sr . was the genesis who promoted medicare back in the 1950 s and 1960 s . 
sitting at that same table was a man by the name of Roy Geisebreck , whom the finance minister will remember playing hockey with back in the 1950 s and 1960 s in Pembroke and Petawawa . 
the Geisebreck family is not only famous for their hockey playing talents . 
the member opposite spoke rather eloquently about small and medium sized businesses . 
the Geisebreck family has been one of the business mainstays in my riding for well over 70 years . 
there were seven brothers involved in the business started by their late dad , Charlie . 
now Roy Geisebreck , who is 82 , is the patriarch of that remarkable family . 
it is people like Roy Geisebreck and his family who have really built this county through hard work and determination . 
they did not skate around the issue like some of the hon. members from the Reform Party and some of the opposition . 
John Yakabuski was there from Barry ' s Bay . 
his father was a member of the provincial government for over 23 years , the provincial government that Premier Mike Harris currently leads . 
John has seen the light . 
he has seen that I am going to support the Liberal Party . 
he was there last night supporting a well known Liberal in my constituency . 
the hon. member opposite talks about tax cuts . 
they made tax cuts , no question about it , but with borrowed money . 
one should not make tax cuts with borrowed money . 
as a result of making those tax cuts with borrowed money , they had to do some closures . 
in my riding they closed the Civic Hospital in Pembroke , Ontario . 
John Yakabuski , as we speak , is on council in Barry ' s Bay . 
he has also taken over his dad ' s hardware business and is doing a remarkable job . 
again , I say to the member opposite , he is one of these people with a small and medium - sized business who is certainly promoting not only the quality of life for Canadians but also the Canadian culture . 
he was absolutely delighted last night with the throne speech that was brought down by Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson . 
Mr. Speaker , you are well aware of Renfrew , Ontario . 
i believe that you have a cottage up in Renfrew where on occasion you go canoeing and swim . 
you would know Mac Wilson from Renfrew . 
Mac Wilson was at this very auspicious event last night . 
Mac Wilson suffered some health problems about six or seven months ago . 
he was hospitalized in Ottawa because we have great medicare and he took advantage of the medicare system . 
Mac was on his back . 
what did he do ? 
did he give up ? 
no , he fought back . 
he is the industrial commissioner but not only that , as you well know , Mr. Speaker by knowing Mr. Wilson personally , he is one of the great entrepreneurial spirits in Renfrew , Ontario . 
we had big Len Shean there last night . 
he is the mayor of Arnprior . 
Len got up and asked the finance minister what we were going to do about the four - laning of Highway 17 . 
i completely agree with Mr. Shean , the big mayor . 
he said we should have more funding set aside for the four - laning of Highway 17 . 
the finance minister clearly indicated to him that we were looking favourably at it but that basically it was at the disposal of the provincial Conservative government . 
however , we will arm - twist and I am sure that we will get the job done . 
we had Tommy Donohue there from the farming community of Douglas . 
one singular characteristic that is endemic to all of these people I have spoken about , and not only to those people but to many people throughout Canada , is simply that they have taken personal responsibility for their lives . 
they do not want us , nor do we want as a government , to infringe upon their entrepreneurial spirit or their joie de vivre by saying that we are going to tell them what to do . 
these people take personal responsibility for their lives . 
they have the vision . 
they have the values of this party and , I am sure , of every colleague in the House . 
i am absolutely delighted to speak on this the last throne speech for the 20 th century and hopefully , if the voters from the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke see fit , I will be here for the first of many throne speeches delivered from this side of the House I might add , so that we will continue to charge on to greatness for this wonderful country called Canada . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise today in reply to my colleague on the throne speech . 
before I do that , I would just like to congratulate Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson on her appointment to the position of Governor General . 
what my colleague from the other side said is quite interesting . 
i would just like to remind him that he is in a federal parliament not in a provincial legislature talking about provincial issues . 
let me ask the member this question . 
it was quoted today in the paper by the Minister of Industry that a stronger focus is needed on tax cuts . 
it states here that he is wise enough to put on the record that tax reform is an important issue . 
the government is not taking this issue as seriously as its own industry minister . 
i would like the hon. member to comment on that point . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier : 
Mr. Speaker , here we go again . 
when the Reform Party first got elected their mantra for years and years was that we have to reduce the deficit . 
there was really no talk about tax cuts . 
its plan , fresh start , or no start , or behind start , or whatever it was , false start , kick start , clearly said to the Canadian public that we had to eradicate the deficit that was left behind by the Conservative government . 
i might add that probably 98 % of those members - and I just saw a former Liberal , who is in the Reform Party , leave - were probably Conservative supporters before they joined this other party . 
they were responsible for a $ 43 billion annual deficit . 
we eradicated that deficit . 
1155 
we are moving in a comprehensive manner . 
we will give further tax cuts . 
that is clearly in our red book agenda . 
i do not know where he is coming from . 
i might tell the hon. member opposite something which I said to the Civitan Club last week in Cobden , Ontario . 
one person got up and asked me if I liked paying taxes . 
i told him to get on the band wagon . 
i said that I do not like paying taxes but that they are a reality of life . 
if the hon. member opposite does not want to pay taxes he should move to some third world country where there are no taxes . 
however , my friend , there is also nothing else , no schools , no infrastructure , no security , no nothing . 
we will reduce and we have reduced taxes . 
it is egregious , it is polemic , it is downright stupid for the Reform Party to stand and say " cut taxes " when we have already done that . 
all their mantra was to get rid of the deficit and we have done that . 
let me get this straight . 
i hope that answers the hon. member . 
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch â teauguay , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the member speak about his family ' s history . 
it was interesting . 
however , after four months of inactivity , I was expecting to hear something about the throne speech . 
the purpose of a throne speech half way through a term of office is not the same as one at the beginning of a term of office . 
right now , there are problems . 
the focus of the member ' s speech could have been very specific . 
i would like the member to take a few moments to talk to us about the constitutional crisis , the fisheries crisis , the health and education crisis , the transportation crisis , the poverty crisis , the EI crisis and the millennium scholarship crisis . 
after four months of inactivity , I think it is time to deal with serious issues and leave family history aside . 
Mr. Hec Clouthier : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very very proud of my family . 
my father was a logger and a farmer , and I am proud of that . 
the hon. member says that the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke is always talking about people . 
but Canada is its people . 
i would tell my friend : " Stay in Canada because you know that this is the greatest country of them all . 
stay calm , my friend . 
you know very well that it is the country of all the people served by all the members of this House of Commons '' . 
i am very surprised that he feels education is not - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member but his time is up . 
the hon. member for Mississauga West . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , congratulations to you on the exalted position you have been returned to . 
how does one follow the oratorical splendour of the previous speaker ? 
he neglected to tell the House that the event he was talking about last evening was his 50 th birthday party . 
we should say happy birthday to our friend from Pembroke . 
we have a few other things in common . 
we are brothers . 
it appears we must be related . 
he talked about his father . 
the interesting thing about my situation is that my dad was a national labour leader . 
i often say that having 10 children , my mother and dad were the only couple I knew who were constantly in labour together . 
i find it interesting , though , returning to the issue at hand , to listen to what clearly amounts to nothing more than a feeding frenzy by the opposition . 
i thought about this place over the break this summer . 
i was shocked this morning , when I got back on my elevator to go upstairs in my apartment building , to see the member for Wild Rose coming down . 
my God , he is in my building and there goes the neighbourhood . 
property values are apparently in serious trouble . 
i will have to look for alternative accommodation . 
infighting occurred . 
expulsions into the back row or oblivion or right out of caucus appeared on the front page of every journal in the country on a regular basis . 
then when Reformers got tired of that they bashed poor Joe Clark . 
it seems that Mr. Clark has rejected their amorous attempts to bring them together in bed . 
all this internal combustion that has been taking place appears to be exploding . 
someone has lit a match under them , I guess , and it appears to be now exploding back into this place in parliament . 
as much as I really want to try to deal with the issues , it would be interesting if the opposition parties could try to do the same thing . 
what they are doing now is just simply , mindlessly , without any kind of proper research other than perhaps the National Post , casting aspersions . 
i talked to Canadians all summer . 
when they watch this stuff they get confused . 
they ask who is right and who they should believe . 
should they believe the Reform Party ? 
we are saying we will cut taxes . 
the Reform Party cannot take yes for an answer . 
Canadians look at it and wonder if they should believe these guys in the opposition or believe the government . 
i heard one thing this morning from the opposition that I agree with . 
unfortunately he then went off into a tirade of nonsensical nonsense , if there is such a thing , a double standard , and he lost a very good point . 
it is the people in Canada who indeed have worked hard , who have re - elected the government because they believed in the platform that we put forward . 
we put our cards on the table . 
we said that we would eliminate that $ 42 billion deficit . 
we said that we would reduce taxes . 
we have done that , regardless of what the opposition continues to say , by some $ 16 billion in the last budget . 
we will reduce taxes again in spite of what members opposite say . 
over 600,000 low income Canadians have been taken off the tax rolls altogether . 
have we done enough ? 
members opposite say we are worse off . 
the United Nations says this is the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
we know that . 
i find it interesting that one can say it is the greatest country in the world in which to live unless one lives here . 
people want to complain . 
i had an experience this summer when I went to Strasbourg , France , to the Council of Europe . 
i listened to the issues that were being debated . 
there were 41 countries from Europe that got together in Strasbourg at the Council of Europe , a 50 year old institution . 
i listened to issues they dealt with . 
they dealt with war , death , destruction of communities , ethnic cleansing and annihilation of entire races of people . 
i am not denigrating or putting down the problems we have in the country . 
some of them are extremely serious but let us take a look around the world . 
this country is a marvellous place . 
perhaps opposition members could at least concede that this country is a marvellous place and that Canadians are not boastful people as our Prime Minister said . 
we are quiet , industrious and hard working as a nation . 
we are known for that throughout the world . 
an hon. member : 
are you quiet ? 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
maybe not all of us are quiet , I would agree , but we are hard working and industrious . 
it cannot possibly be the doom and gloom we hear opposite . 
i give some credit to the member for Wild Rose for raising the very valid issue of the problems on our reserves . 
it puzzles me , when I hear a member from the opposite side talking about supporting the natives on our reserves and improving their quality of life , that they do not support the Nisga ' a treaty . 
that treaty has wide support in British Columbia yet they do not support it . 
i also heard them talk about people on the street . 
if there is one problem that is absolutely visible to people who come to this country from other parts of the world , it is the fact that we have a serious homelessness problem . 
we must do something about it . 
it is mentioned in the throne speech , but let me add that a throne speech is a visionary document . 
the work is yet to be done . 
members opposite know full well that those specifics will appear in a budget in February , a budget for which I am quite sure they already have their negative remarks prepared . 
it will lay it out in detail . 
i do not want to overdramatize the issue but we have seen an explosion in the youth in all of North America . 
it has even occurred in western Canada . 
there is a reason for it and we must address the reason . 
it cannot be fixed overnight . 
there have to be stronger families , stronger opportunities for parental care and supervision , and strong leadership within families . 
it is my view that a throne speech simply sets out the vision for that to occur . 
we want to do all these things and it is difficult to balance everything . 
we believe in tax cuts . 
we absolutely believe in reducing the debt which is a burden for future children of the country . 
it is a top priority . 
we believe in our children and in our youth and that the plan laid out in the throne speech has very strong merits to make us the country of the next millennium . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it hurts me to say this but I would like to compliment my two Liberal colleagues on their speeches . 
i do so because they spoke from the heart . 
while I fundamentally disagree with much of what they say , they have the ability to speak from their hearts rather than from a canned speech handed to them by somebody in the lobby . 
perhaps they could talk to their colleagues and give us a little more entertainment in this place . 
my colleague made a comment about whom people should trust or believe . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the compliments . 
that is probably all I need to say . 
i know what his question was - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
we will go now to the member for Churchill River . 
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the regional diversity of Canada is witnessed by everyone who travels the country , but the agricultural industry and the family farm are in crisis . 
time and time again everyone points to the throne speech and says that the family farm was not discussed . 
perhaps the member could respond at some point in time to the fact that part of our family has fallen into hard times . 
can he speak to this issue at all ? 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , not representing a farming community obviously puts me at some disadvantage , but as national politicians we must address all these issues . 
i thank the member for raising the issue . 
our government must continue to support GRIP . 
we have to find a way to make the family farm stronger . 
that is part of the overall goal . 
one does not exclude one segment of society simply because there may not be a specific reference . 
we are talking about tax cuts . 
i think they will help farmers . 
we are talking about new technology , investing in science , finding new ways to treat crops , new ways to cut costs for farmers and programs that are already in place . 
i agree with the member ' s concern and I am confident the government will help farmers . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a couple of comments . 
forty - eight per cent of the farming community in the areas we have been referring to are up for bankruptcy . 
quality of life is in jeopardy for these people , which is something the member would not know anything about because he thinks milk comes from a carton or that pork is manufactured in some plant . 
i wish the Liberal government could visit reserves to see the squalor that exists . 
the Nisga ' a agreement does not solve that but accountability does . 
when the government came to power in 1993 it announced that one million children were living in poverty and that something had to be done . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not consider child poverty to be a very funny issue at all . 
our government has announced that we have already increased the national child credit and that we are committed to doing more in that area . 
the most important thing we can do for the country is to ensure that all families , all Canadians , have equal access to opportunity ; that children go to school with full bellies in the morning ; and that they have proper supervision and someone to come home to at the end of the day . 
i have raised three boys and I have some understanding of where milk comes from , regardless of the member ' s denigrating remarks . 
we must and we will do something about child poverty . 
it will be action , not words , and not the negativity I hear coming from members opposite . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i would simply like to draw to your attention the fact that my colleague from Beauharnois - Salaberry will be sharing his time with my colleague for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , and that all colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois will be sharing time for the rest of the debate . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take the opportunity of my first speech of the second session of the 36 th legislature to greet the people of Beauharnois - Salaberry and to let them know that I intend to continue to represent them in this House with dignity and to behave in a manner that is fully respectful of Parliament and its members . 
i reiterate my commitment to continue to serve the public within this institution , a service which gives a deep and sincere meaning to my political commitment . 
i would also like to greet my landlady here in the federal capital region , Mrs. Anne Allard , who has honoured me today with her presence in the Opposition gallery . 
i was not much impressed by the Speech from the Throne , and even less impressed by the address in reply given yesterday by the Prime Minister . 
what I find objectionable in these speeches is not so much their ceremonious nature but , rather , their pretentiousness . 
there is something unhealthy about a speech in which the government keeps repeating that Canada is the best country , that it is the envy of the whole world and that others dream of a country like ours . 
the fact is that such pretentiousness cannot hide the insecurity that characterizes this country , that compels it to make an abusive use of its flag and symbols to create an identity that it is sorely lacking . 
such insecurity probably explains why the Prime Minister likes to refer to Canada as a multicultural , postnational society , while trying to present his government as a national government . 
it is not the first such paradox from the Prime Minister . 
this speech is indeed a paradox , given that a supposedly national government is opting for a way which , for Canada , is increasingly less respectful of federalism , an allegedly national government that is delivering , at least as regards Quebec , an increasingly less coherent speech . 
incidentally , is it not strange that , following the Mont - Tremblant conference on federalism and globalization - in which my colleagues and myself were , as can be expected , very pleased to participate - the word " federalism " is nowhere to be found in the throne speech , nor is the term " federation '' , and the adjective " federal " is used only four times ? 
by contrast , the speech refers to national will , national strategy , national program , national child benefit , national action plan on skills and learning , national health system , national accord with the voluntary sector , and so on . 
so , after the great federalist statements made in Mont - Tremblant , here we have the national ambitions in Ottawa . 
national ambitions may seem quite legitimate to Canadians who want the federal government to take on a greater role in the areas of family policy , education , health , or in the voluntary sector . 
as far as Quebecers are concerned , the jurisdiction of the National Assembly and of the Government of Quebec should not be limited by such intrusions and by such ambitions , because these ambitions become intrusions . 
each successive government in Quebec has challenged the federal government ' s right to invade Quebec ' s areas of jurisdiction , by using its exorbitant spending power . 
in this regard , the Speech from the Throne , like the latest budget speech , puts the framework agreement on social union at the centre of its national strategy , an agreement that incorporates the national will of the Liberal government . 
it should no doubt be mentioned that Quebec did not sign the agreement , because the Speech from the Throne does not mention Quebec ' s opposition and treats Quebec ' s objection as empty . 
but what does it matter , the framework agreement on social union , like the Constitution Act , 1982 , before it , which Quebecers objected to and continue to do so , is to structure Canada of tomorrow , to provide it with a national government , to focus on health care , post - secondary education and social services . 
the Bloc Quebecois will defend the interests of Quebecers here in the House of Commons , and will keep on reminding people that the framework agreement on social union , just like the 1982 Constitution , was adopted without the consent of Quebec and cannot be imposed upon it . 
the modest place reserved for national unity , an expression moreover that does not figure in the text of the 1999 throne speech , only thinly disguises how much the Liberal government is troubled by this question . 
the cause of this seems to be the continuing high level of support for sovereignty and the fact that Quebecers are keeping all of their options open as far as their political and constitutional future is concerned . 
moreover , it is aggravated by the fact that the commitment to an in - depth reform of federalism cannot be respected and that no concrete proposal for renewal has been formulated , as is clearly evident in the throne speech and the Prime Minister ' s address in reply , both of which indicate the total absence of a plan A , which we now realize will never see the light of day . 
it also explains the laconic nature of the throne speech , which contains two very general statements , one that suggests Quebecers do not want a third referendum , and another that invents a new principle of clarity . 
as far as this second point is concerned , the Government of Canada , which demands clarity from others , is hiding behind a principle of clarity that the supreme court has not ruled constitutional so as to hide its own intentions . 
it is leaving itself lots of leeway to interfere in Quebec ' s referendum process . 
will it resort to legislation , a motion , or a ministerial statement ? 
when it comes to clarity , we have seen better . 
and here is a clear message to all ministers responsible for clarity , truth , interference and guardianship : they will have to answer to the Bloc Quebecois , which will proclaim loud and clear that Quebec is a sovereign nation and that , when the time comes , it will oppose any plan designed to limit its freedom to choose its own destiny . 
in conclusion , I would like to quote from Jean de La Fontaine , who wrote in one of his fables : 
discussion is what many like . 
opinions in the court abound . 
but calls to action strike great fear . 
supporters then cannot be found . 
today , the government keeps talking about Plan B in an attempt to give it new life . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague ' s speech was very clear and no one asked for any clarification on his excellent analysis of the situation . 
before dealing directly with the throne speech , I want to convey the following message to all farming families in my riding , in Quebec , and even in Canada : the Bloc Quebecois will not let you down . 
the Bloc Quebecois will continue to demand additional resources to fight organized crime efficiently and to eliminate the terror that these families are subjected to year after year by cannabis producers . 
in the weeks or months to come , my colleagues from Berthier - Montcalm and Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert will propose legal measures to step up the fight against organized crime , particularly with regard to cannabis producers . 
we expect the government , which has a great responsibility in this regard , to take measures based on our proposals . 
that being said , I will now deal with the throne speech from a public finance perspective . 
first , I want to correct two major blunders found in the Speech from the Throne , which I am sure are accidental , but which have left a lot of people wondering . 
i am convinced these are mistakes . 
the two big blunders found in various parts of the throne speech are the references to tax reductions and to the government ' s determination to fight poverty . 
there appears to be two analytical and factual errors in the speech . 
i will take the next few minutes to set the record straight . 
first of all , I practically fell off my seat when I saw in the throne speech that the government had reduced taxes by $ 16 billion over three years . 
at this rate , if we are to believe the government , in about ten years ' time , Canadians will not be paying a cent in taxes . 
that is what the Minister of Finance is telling us . 
he talked about the cumulative tax cuts he has supposedly made over the years and added them up . 
if we took this to its logical conclusion , in ten years not a single Canadian would be paying any personal income taxes . 
it is well known that the Minister of Finance eliminates surpluses . 
the truth is that he has continued to cook the books . 
a look at the most recent Department of Finance publication shows that Quebecers and Canadians were paying $ 5.5 billion less in taxes in 1993 - 94 , before the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government took office , than they are today . 
in other words , by means of various hidden taxes , as well as tax tables and a fiscal structure in general that are completely unindexed , the government has increased the tax burden of Quebecers and Canadians by $ 5.5 billion since 1993 - 94 . 
undeniably , there have been tax cuts . 
the last four years have seen a number of such cuts . 
let us look at some examples of just what sort of cuts the Minister of Finance is offering . 
let us take the last budget . 
a significant measure in the last budget was the abolition of the 3 % individual surtax . 
yet when one looks at those who have really been the ones responsible for putting public finances on a sounder footing , that is the middle income earners , those with annual incomes of between $ 30,000 and $ 70,000 , they have saved approximately $ 160 in taxes this year . 
they are the ones who are being strangled by the lack of indexation and by other disguised taxes , and they are never the ones who get any recompense for their efforts . 
yes , there have been tax cuts . 
but cuts for the richest people in this country . 
those who have been most responsible for putting public finances on a sounder footing have been totally forgotten . 
i will offer two figures to illustrate this . 
families earning between $ 30,000 and $ 70,000 in Canada constitute 27 % of Canadian taxpayers . 
they are responsible for about 50 % of personal income taxes that flow into the federal government ' s coffers . 
do you see the imbalance ? 
these people make up a little over one quarter of all taxpayers , but they contribute half of all the taxes paid by individuals to Ottawa . 
it is for that group that the government must do something , not for those earning $ 250,000 or more , which include millionaire friends of the Minister of Finance . 
it is in that category that the government should have taken action , but did not . 
the fact is that , in net terms , Canadian individuals pay $ 5.5 billion more in taxes than they did before the Liberal government came to office , in 1993 . 
the other major blunder to which I referred earlier is the fight against poverty . 
i read on page 7 of the throne speech that the government intends to make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty . 
i believe there is a mistake here . 
i think the analyses were not presented properly and the government will make corrections . 
how can you break the cycle of poverty when you are the one that created it ? 
i can only conclude that excluding the unemployed from the employment insurance program , excluding people who are experiencing hard times because they lost their jobs has resulted in an increase in the number of people living in poverty . 
how can the cycle of poverty be broken when the government is the author of it and is not prepared to change the employment insurance plan . 
in some instances , problems have been deliberately incorporated in the plan . 
let us take , for example , the case of pregnant women , who must stop working because their health and the health of their child are at stake . 
because of the problems in the plan , weeks spent on the Quebec CCST are not included in the calculation of hours and weeks worked in order to be able to enjoy special employment insurance benefits subsequently . 
this is a serious problem . 
women are therefore going to think twice before taking precautionary time off work , thus putting their own health and the health of their child at risk . 
there are a lot of problems in the system . 
and why do all these problems exist ? 
why are most of the unemployed excluded ? 
in order to bring in a surplus of between $ 6 billion and $ 7 billion . 
this is despicable . 
finally , when we look at this government , we realize that it generates poverty . 
in conclusion , in examining this and having seen what the government proposed in the throne speech , we have no choice but to consider this government irresponsible . 
it is much better at making hollow formulae than at correcting inequality and fighting poverty with vigour . 
for all these reasons , we reject this throne speech , which is worth nothing more than the paper it is written on . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
as a member of the government side of the House and as a Canadian , I must say how proud I was of our Prime Minister yesterday . 
he gave a tremendous speech and allowed us to contemplate Canada today in the context of our past . 
the Prime Minister reminded us that we did not discover this land , that first nations and Inuit people were here first and welcomed newcomers so many years ago . 
he reminded us of our French heritage , of our British heritage . 
the Prime Minister allowed us to contemplate the fact that out of a need to downplay nationalistic tendencies , we now are a country that values quiet confidence and modesty . 
out of a need to share wealth , we in Canada now value the sharing of wealth and generosity not only between and among citizens and between and among regions of this great country , but between Canada and other countries around the world . 
we know that Canada out of a need to respect individual citizens and respect the importance of each one of us as Canadians is now a country that absolutely respects and values human rights and freedoms . 
out of the need to govern with compassion over the turbulent but wonderful history we call ours , we are now a country that values governance with compassion , governance with tolerance , governance with generosity . 
we indeed know that our country is a wonderful and unique federation . 
to many , Canada is an experiment , but to us , Canada is a logical , practical and principled society and we are always pushing at the edges of what we know to be civilization . 
i am convinced that as we move into the 21 st century we will continue to do that . 
but if we look at the nineties , our options to continue to improve this great country in which we live were limited . 
the decade of the nineties was a time of turbulence , of difficulties for citizens and for our country . 
we know that unemployment rates were extraordinarily high . 
we know that we were under very significant fiscal constraints . 
but with the leadership of our Prime Minister and with the extraordinary will of the Canadian people we are now back in a stable form . 
unemployment is at its lowest level in nine years at 7.5 % . 
there is an increasing respect and confidence in Canadian institutions . 
we know that we live in a great federation and we are continuing to appreciate that and to build on that . 
we got our fiscal house in order . 
we are governing in a balanced way . 
we are attacking our debt . 
as Liberals we have always said that we were not interested in making cuts for the sake of making cuts . 
getting our fiscal house in order was a challenge we set for ourselves so that we would allow ourselves the choices to continue to improve and build on our great federation . 
on the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister identified in his speech yesterday a number of areas that we set out as our priorities as we move into the 21 st century . 
we want to continue to build our strong federation . 
i would like elaborate on a couple of those aspects in my speech today . 
first , Canadians now know that the government has put a priority and a focus on our children . 
as we reflect on the work of our country in the past decades , we know that we have found ways to support Canadian seniors with programs like the old age security , guaranteed income supplement and our partnership with the provinces with the Canada pension plan . 
those are programs that Canadians know and appreciate and which seniors access . 
those programs have allowed us to significantly reduce poverty among Canadian seniors . 
we have programs in place to support working age Canadians , such as employment insurance and the provinces have income support . 
those programs are there . 
Canadians are familiar with them and use them if they have to . 
we have encouraged and supported our young people in finding that very important first job . 
we have encouraged them to continue with post - secondary education . 
we are finding ways as a country to support our youth . 
in the Speech from the Throne we identified continuing ways to support Canada ' s youth by ensuring that they have the opportunity to travel this great nation through exchanges to get to know each other . 
that is critically important in a country as large as ours . 
we know that at earlier ages young people are able to contribute and the notion of celebrating their first works is an important priority for our government . 
there is no question that remains paramount . 
it is parents who have the responsibility and the ability to raise healthy children . 
but times are changing . 
it is very expensive to raise children . 
yes , it is appropriate that we make tax cuts in support of families . 
the Reform Party would see that as being the only support we can provide to our children , but we know there is much more that is needed . 
research is telling us that the very early years of a child ' s life , zero to six , are critical . 
that research is now becoming more and more available to us . 
in the Speech from the Throne we have been directed to work together as governments , the Government of Canada with the provinces and territories , to explore this research , to understand it and to build some common values and principles as to how we can support parents and children through those very early times . 
that work has already begun . 
we have sat at the table with the provinces and territories . 
we have built a document , the national children ' s agenda , which is now being discussed in workshops around Canada . 
we will look for input from Canadians on that to assess the values and principles that should guide us as we build a stronger partnership with Canadian citizens , parents and children to support early childhood development . 
we intend to have that work completed and to present it to Canadians by December 2000 . 
there is more . 
we know there is a direct relationship between children at risk and the income of their families . 
provinces have supported families through income support measures and services for children . 
we know that the most important thing we can do is to find ways and means for all Canadians to have a job . 
that is the biggest thing we can do . 
when parents , men and women , move from welfare into a job , very often that job may be low paying . 
it is difficult for parents to contemplate leaving welfare , where services may also be part of their support for their children , to take a low paying job . 
we are changing that through the national child benefit . 
in this system the federal government provides money to families with children for income whether they are on income support or in low wage positions . 
the savings that the provinces gleaned from that additional money coming from the federal government are being reinvested in services for Canadian children , services that are available to them whether they are supported by families on income support or in low income jobs . 
we are making progress . 
these are the kinds of approaches that show a flexible relationship between the Government of Canada and the provinces is working . 
we know it to be a good platform and we want to build on that . 
in the Speech from the Throne we identified that we would make a significant additional investment in the national child benefit by July 2002 . 
of course everyone heard the Prime Minister yesterday . 
he identified this as being a priority and he has moved that date up to July 2001 . 
there is another aspect to this that is tremendously important . 
we are starting to really understand the changing relationship between the workplace and the family . 
seventy per cent of Canadian families are dual income families , mom and dad both working . 
of course that is changing the relationship between what they are able to do as parents in support of their children . 
that is where we step back and ask , recognizing that those early years are so important , is there not something more that we can do to help parents spend more time with their children and their infants in those very early years ? 
we have identified that indeed there is . 
the Prime Minister said that we would double the benefit , make it more flexible and more accessible . 
in terms of flexibility , we also appreciate that there are adoptive parents and that they too need to be home with their children in those early years . 
in terms of accessibility , we will know that we have made changes to the employment insurance program . 
wisely , we have put in place a monitoring and assessment system so that every year we receive information about how that system is working . 
i am looking forward to receiving this year ' s monitoring and assessment report to contemplate that trend , to see if indeed we have to do something to ensure there is accessibility . 
as the Prime Minister indicated , we want to ensure that there is accessibility to this incredible and significant new plan that was announced yesterday . 
with all this and a focus on children we are recognizing that it is wise for us to invest in the early years . 
if we focus on our children the dividends will be huge . 
out of a need to invest in our children I am convinced that we will come to value children as our most valuable resource . 
in the context of valuing people , let us turn to another aspect of the Speech from the Throne . 
the challenge for us as a country is to ensure that our citizens have the ability to participate in the knowledge based economy , to be able to continue to develop and benefit from a vastly and rapidly changing economy . 
we will do that . 
first and foremost we have to ensure that we build a tradition of lifelong learning in Canada . 
in the Speech from the Throne we identified that that will be a priority for us , to work with our partners , with the private sector and with the provinces to do what we can to make sure that from our very early years right through to our senior years we value and engage in lifelong learning . 
that means improving literacy , without question . 
we have a dynamic partnership with the provinces right across this country in focusing on upgrading the literacy of our citizens . 
we have also built strong partnerships with the provinces in the area of labour market development . 
the provinces now have active measures within the agreements that we have written with most provinces and they are using them to facilitate and stimulate the capacity development of their citizens so they can participate in the new Canadian economy . 
we need to do more . 
we need to appreciate that our economy is not a single economy , but is sectoral . 
there are different aspects and sectors to the diverse Canadian economy . 
we need to partner more effectively with the private sector and with unions to understand that , to encourage them to look at their industries , to look at the timeframes , to help smooth out the peaks and valleys , to identify their workforce requirements . 
we can do a better job in this regard . 
in fact , by doing so , instead of following the trends in the economy , we can lead the trends in the economy . 
another thing that is tremendously important is making sure that Canadians have the information they need to make decisions about employment opportunities and business opportunities . 
there was a recent forum for labour market ministers , attended by all provinces and territories , including Quebec , to talk about this . 
we agreed that it is wise for us to work together to create a platform of information that can be used locally at the community level , at the provincial level , at the national level and at the international level so that Canadians have the information they need to make the appropriate decisions for their lives and the lives of their families . 
without question , we have to reach out and engage others at the very beginning of the development of policies . 
we have to work with the private sector and with the voluntary sector . 
we cannot abrogate our responsibility to lead and to make important decisions , but we can find a modern way , a 21 st century way , of building sustainable policies and programs that speak to all Canadians . 
this is a fundamental issue . 
these are the challenges that we have set for ourselves . 
they are a reflection of our belief that we live in a wonderful country , that we have built a flexible federation , that we have something to work for , something to be proud of and something to build upon . 
the Speech from the Throne , as it was presented , gives us all these opportunities . 
i , as a member of this side of the House and a great team , am committed to doing what I can to continue to build a great Canada , to build a Canada which is where people want to be in the 21 st century , to build a Canada that we know will continue to be the greatest country in the world in which to live . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , having known this minister now for quite some time I realize that there is a lot of care and a lot of compassion in her heart . 
i can understand that . 
we have talked a lot over the years about the squalid conditions on reserves , the poverty that exists . 
the conditions , by the way , are not getting any better ; they are getting worse in many cases . 
i have continued to visit these reserves on a regular basis , right up until the time we returned to the House this month . 
it has also been brought to my attention that in 1993 members of the House said that we had to do something about the one million children living in poverty . 
it was also reported this morning that for every one million children who go to school , 166,000 of them go hungry . 
these are the problems that exist . 
they are worse today than they were in 1993 when the government took office . 
what has the government in mind to deal with these problems ? 
programs designed for the year 2001 are not going to make a lot of people happy . 
what is it going to do tomorrow to alleviate these problems ? 
what measures is it going to take to eliminate these serious problems ? 
where is the action ? 
i want to see it . 
hon. Jane Stewart : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the question . 
indeed , the issue of child poverty is an issue that the government takes very seriously . 
that is why we have already invested $ 1.7 billion extra per year in the national child benefit . 
it is that benefit that goes to children in low income families . 
it is that benefit that allows provinces to reinvest their savings in services for these children in the kinds of projects that the hon. member references , food , child support and all those sorts of things . 
that is why , recognizing this as being a priority , in the Speech from the Throne it was announced that we are going to invest another significant amount in the child benefit . 
despite all this , I bet that side of the House will vote against these measures . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a few weeks ago , the minister said that , in Canada , the rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer . 
this was what she told La Presse about two weeks ago . 
we were looking forward to some sort of corrective action in the throne speech . 
today , 40 % of elderly women living on their own are living below the poverty level . 
our old age pension system leaves 40 % of elderly women living below the poverty level , and the throne speech offered no solution . 
then there is EI , for which 40 % of unemployed workers qualify . 
today , all Canada ' s resource regions are facing terrible situations . 
we argued for a full year against the intensity rule for seasonal workers , among others . 
in resource regions , 80 % of workers are affected by this rule . 
i would have expected the new Minister of Human Resources Development to have won out over her more hardhearted Cabinet colleagues , but it seems not . 
that is true , but one must have a decent income . 
here in Canada we have the same situation developing , because we wanted to have an employment insurance system similar to the Americans ' . 
more and more people have work , the unemployment rate is dropping , but the bottom line is that overall family incomes have dropped . 
this is not an incentive to work , but a disincentive . 
it tells people " Even if you work , you will not qualify , or if you do qualify , we will not give you enough weeks of benefits '' . 
i will conclude with the matter of parental leave . 
if I have understood the minister correctly , she is going to wait for the third year report evaluating the employment insurance program before deciding whether she is going to make eligibility conditions easier for women . 
if she does indeed wait for the third year , I have just realized why the program would come into effect only in 2001 . 
there was also a 7 % drop in the amount paid out . 
cannot the minister commit today to stating that the rules for eligibility , which have nothing to do with extending the length of parental leave , could very easily take effect now ? 
hon. Jane Stewart : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member looks at the Speech from the Throne and the commitments of the Prime Minister to double parental benefits , he will see that significant changes to the employment insurance system have been announced . 
everything that he speaks about suggests that he will indeed support us in terms of the Speech from the Throne and the measures we introduced . 
as the economy has changed and increased , one thing that has become clear is that poverty has been stopped this time around . 
usually as the economy increases poverty returns . 
it ebbs . 
we must remember that governments have a role to play in supporting their citizens and in developing programs and policies that do not create have and have nots . 
if he looks at the items itemized in the Speech from the Throne and listened to the speech of the Prime Minister yesterday and the speeches from this side of the House over the course of this debate , the hon. member will see that we understand the role we must play in ensuring that we do not create have and have nots in Canada . 
one of the best ways of doing it is to focus on our children , and we are committed to doing that . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think all of us here want the federation to work , we want the sharing of powers between the provinces and the federal government to work properly . 
the problem is that everyone wants to be excessively visible . 
for instance , there is currently no issue more serious than health in our country . 
i want to ask the minister if she thinks - after cutting $ 17 billion in the social transfers to the provinces for health , education and help for the poor - that the government can do its utmost to ensure that people can get medical treatment in our country . 
especially in Quebec , there are very serious problems in the hospitals ' emergency services and some people have no choice but to get medical treatment outside Canada . 
in addition to the internal problems that we are faced with because of a lack of funding , the cuts made to transfer payments have been drastic . 
this is true for every sector , but I am asking the minister if there is any hope for the health sector . 
hon. Jane Stewart : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is specifically asking the Government of Canada to focus on the issue of health care . 
i remind him that indeed we have . 
some $ 11.5 billion were announced in the last budget to continue to support delivery of health services by the provinces . 
that is the kind of partnership we in Canada believe in . 
that is the kind of flexible federation we know works and that is the approach we are committed to continuing . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by announcing that I will be splitting my 20 minutes with the hon. member for Vancouver East . 
in the limited time I have available I would like to make a few comments on the Speech from the Throne and the state we find the government in . 
one thinks of the metaphor of a deer caught in the headlights . 
there is a long list of things for which the government stands condemned for a failure to act in a timely fashion , or in many cases a failure to act at all . 
the first one that comes to mind is the crisis in agriculture in the country and the fact that producers in Saskatchewan , Manitoba and many other places are facing an income crisis the like of which they have never experienced before . 
the government stands condemned in terms of its inaction with respect to agriculture . 
we hear the Prime Minister say it is a private matter . 
i cannot imagine that even 10 years ago , and particularly 15 or 20 years ago , the Prime Minister of Canada would have said that the future of the Canadian airline industry - Air Canada , Canadian Airlines and the structure of the Canadian air transportation system - was a private matter . 
yet that is the kind of thing the Prime Minister has said . 
we have a government that has stood idly by without taking the kind of action which might ensure that not only jobs and consumers are protected but that Canadian control is protected and we do not end up in a situation in the country like we now have with the railways where basically we are owned and controlled by American shareholders . 
on water exports , we have various provincial projects going ahead . 
the Gisborne Lake project in Newfoundland has received tentative forms of approval . 
instead of acting on a motion passed by the House of Commons back in February which called for a national ban on the export of bulk water , we have nothing except the ball being thrown back and forth between various provincial capitals and this government . 
there has been no action yet to ban bulk water exports and no promise of such legislation in the throne speech , not a mention of it . 
when it comes to the fishery on the east coast and the judgment of the supreme court with respect to the treaty rights of aboriginal people in that area , we have a government which appears to have been totally unable to have anticipated what that judgment might be or to have anticipated difference scenarios so that if the judgment came down in favour of treaty rights , as did happen , then it would have some plan in place . 
this is just elementary . 
yet it is almost as if the Liberals were caught completely by surprise and almost as if they did not even know the supreme court was considering it . 
this has been complicated . 
it arose in the first place because of an unwillingness on the part of the government to act on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples which said that these things should be negotiated and not left to the courts . 
were they negotiated ? 
was there action taken ? 
nothing . 
now we have an horrendous crisis on the east coast as a result of that inaction . 
on homelessness , winter is coming . 
perhaps the Liberals do not know this . 
perhaps so many of them go on winter holidays that they do not know that winter is coming and it gets cold in Canada . 
we have thousands , perhaps tens of thousands of people who are homeless . 
yet did we see any commitment to real money and real action in the throne speech with respect to homelessness ? 
we have a minister of housing but we do not have a minister who is willing to do anything about homelessness , or about housing for that matter . 
we have the crisis in the west coast with respect to the abuse of our refugee system and all the questions that raises . 
No. I do not know what the government is waiting for , and no one else seems to know . 
we have had for a long time now promises of legislation to deal with new reproductive technologies and all the tremendous choices , options and I would say potential evils and dangers that lurk in that array of technologies . 
silence . 
it will not be . 
we have to address these issues and more . 
ten years will have passed . 
will child poverty have been dealt with ? 
the list goes on and on . 
people know as a result of court decisions that our child pornography laws are inadequate . 
we can have a debate about how we should respond to that , whether we should use the notwithstanding clause , appeal the decision or whether we should bring the law back to parliament and write a better law if the law is inadequate . 
let us write a law that deals with that situation . 
do we have such a law before us ? 
do we have even the promise of such a law before us ? 
not a hint , not a sniff of action on any of these fronts . 
it is worth asking why there is this powerlessness , this impotence and this complete silence with respect to so many issues . 
if we look we will see that the underlying reality of all this is the way in which over the past 10 or 15 years , sometimes for good and well intentioned reasons and other times for less well intentioned reasons , this place , both parliament and government , has abdicated its responsibility in many ways to first the marketplace and in some other ways to the courts . 
the government reflects the powerlessness it has chosen by repeatedly signing agreements or adopting policies that make it incapable of dealing with a lot of the situations that we have before us . 
why in part do we have the crisis in agriculture ? 
because this government and governments before it have deliberately stripped the Canadian farmer of all the support systems that used to exist . 
why ? 
because we wanted to be the international Boy Scouts of the marketplace , with all due respect to the Boy Scouts because they sometimes get maligned by being associated with the government . 
the fact is the government has stripped Canadian farmers of the support systems they used to have . 
this started with the elimination of the Crow rate and went right on down . 
then they say there is a crisis in agriculture . 
no wonder . 
other countries have not left their producers abandoned to the marketplace in the way our country has . 
on airlines , what we have before us is the result of deregulation and privatization . 
i can remember when deregulation and privatization first came in . 
oh what a wonderful world it was to be with competition , healthy Canadian airlines competing with each other . 
it was to be a capitalist Nirvana . 
at that time we said that what is happening today would happen . 
we are sorry to be right but the fact is that we were right . 
what we predicted at that time is now happening . 
now we see a government so addicted to the bromides of the marketplace , to the idea that this is a private matter and who would want to interfere in the marketplace , that we stand on the brink of having our airline industry completely taken over by American interests . 
the list goes on . 
we cannot deal with water exports because of NAFTA . 
we cannot deal with poverty or homelessness because that would involve interfering in the marketplace . 
what do we have to do for homeless people ? 
build them houses , for God ' s sake . 
that is what they need , but there is no market for the kind of houses poor people can afford . 
we would have to do that with government money . 
we would have to do that outside the marketplace . 
what a heinous thing . 
what a blasphemous thing that would be because that is outside the political conversation now . 
they want the government to do something . 
if that means getting out of agreements , intervening in the marketplace and acting like governments used to act , then it is high time it did that . 
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have had the privilege of listening to the member for Winnipeg - Transcona for a number of years . 
philosophically there are a number of issues we are compatible on , but he was not putting out factually correct information on four specific issues related to my community in downtown Toronto . 
the first point is on the issue of homelessness . 
city councillor Jack Layton is having a heyday capitalizing on those 500 to 700 people who are living on the streets of Toronto which none of us like to see . 
the reality is that the issue is affordable shelter . 
yesterday the Prime Minister spoke very specifically about an infrastructure program . 
i think the member and I know the people of my community will be quite satisfied in the very near future as the whole issue of affordable shelter will be central to the infrastructure plan which is unfolding . 
the second issue is that of banning exports of water . 
the Minister of the Environment even before we had recessed for the summer break took very specific measures in the announcement banning exports of water . 
that is something the member obviously missed . 
another issue relates to the children ' s legacy . 
i do not think anyone in the House would deny the fact that the Prime Minister ' s remarks in the House last night went a long way toward moving the commitment to children forward . 
i think it is important that the member when he is criticizing also acknowledge some of the very specific initiatives that were taken . 
finally on the Onex deal where I have very strong views myself , we had assurances yesterday from the Minister of Transport , which I am sure the member read in the paper , that on the issue of air transportation in this country we will have a full and vigorous debate in the House . 
every member will have an opportunity to put his or her views forward and will be accountable . 
it is important when we are having this debate that we at least acknowledge those areas where the government has acted immediately . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Speaker , the member says the Prime Minister talked about affordable shelter . 
big deal . 
the government has been talking about affordable shelter for years now . 
we want to see affordable shelters , real objective things that people can live in and people can find shelter in . 
we do not want more fancy speeches from the member , the Prime Minister or anyone else when it comes to homelessness . 
we want real action . 
my complaint is that there has been no real action . 
no one else in the whole country is aware that there has been a national ban on bulk water exports except the hon. member for Broadview - Greenwood . 
to suggest that there has been flies in the face of reality . 
talk to Premier Tobin in Newfoundland . 
ask him if there has been a national ban on bulk water exports . 
he is calling for the federal government to either institute one or give him the freedom to act provincially , one way or the other . 
with respect to the children ' s legacy , I am not sure what the hon. member was talking about but the fact is that when it comes to child poverty , it is a lot worse . 
when it comes to the wonderful , tremendous increase in maternity benefits that the minister for human resources was bragging about not so long ago , it is not going to happen until January 1 , 2001 . 
good luck if a woman is pregnant now or is going to get pregnant in the next year . 
it does not increase her eligibility . 
all kinds of women who may be expecting between now and then still , even if they get pregnant in 2002 , will not be eligible because the eligibility will not have changed . 
with respect to Onex , we are going to have a vigorous debate and then we will get screwed . 
i have seen enough vigorous debates around here to know that they are meaningless unless there are real options on the table and a real commitment by the government because in the end the government will get its way . 
it will have the sham of a vigorous debate . 
it might even let a few Liberal backbenchers stand up and say they do not like what is going on to help the Liberals get re - elected in places like Winnipeg . 
Winnipeg is one of the places that stands to really get it in the ear if this thing goes through . 
we will have a nice vigorous debate and then we will have our airline industry taken over by the United States . 
some comfort . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am almost loath to interrupt the wonderful , enlightened flow of consciousness from the member for Winnipeg - Transcona . 
he has really hit the nail on the head in addressing the issues in the throne speech that concern us . 
i am very happy he has agreed to share his time with me so I can provide some feedback from my perspective and the perspective of our party with regard to the throne speech . 
i listened earlier to the new Minister of Human Resources Development . 
we hope to see some significant improvements to EI and the national children ' s agenda . 
hearing the minister ' s comments about living in a wonderful country with such tolerance and compassion conjures up the image of Liberals looking up at the blue sky with the clouds rolling by . 
many times we have heard the Prime Minister say how proud he is that Canada has been rated by the United Nations as the number one country in the world in which to live . 
but let it also be said that the same United Nations has condemned Canada for its failure to live up to international covenants , for its failure to deal with homelessness , to deal with equity and equality , to deal with the growing gap between people who are getting wealthier and people who are getting poorer . 
when I listened to the throne speech I wanted to hear on behalf of my constituents some clear realistic objectives and commitments that would see a government prepared to bring in a national children ' s agenda , to bring in program and income supports that would reverse this downward spiral , this race to the bottom that we are in . 
apparently the government does not care about this . 
i was disappointed by what I heard . 
i have received feedback from people in my riding , people who are really hard pressed , parents who are working at more than one job , part time jobs , struggling to find child care with their kids on waiting lists . 
these people are being threatened because their housing is going to be demolished or 30 % , 40 % , 50 % or in some cases 60 % of their income is going toward rent . 
these are the families I deal with . 
i know that not just in East Vancouver but in other communities hundreds of thousands of Canadians are facing this reality . 
i listened to the Leader of the Opposition and his response to the throne speech and his view of Canada . 
he has such a narrow definition of what a family is or what a family needs . 
i heard the Leader of the Opposition with his anti - government message that if we just put a few pennies in our pockets through a tax saving , somehow we will have solutions . 
we can see that the Reform Party is bankrupt in its ideas in terms of addressing the substantive issues in our society . 
when we look at the messages in the throne speech and the unfolding of the so - called national children ' s agenda we have to question why a national children ' s agenda exists but there is no child care program . 
why does a national children ' s agenda exist but there is no commitment that the poorest of the poor will have the benefit of the national child tax benefit ? 
why do we have a national children ' s agenda that supposedly speaks to the well - being of early childhood development and the well - being of Canadian families but it does not contain any substance to develop affordable housing , the most basic human right for all Canadian families and all people ? 
we have to be very clear . 
we cannot accept that a children ' s agenda will exist without a national child care strategy . 
for decades numerous groups in this country have advocated for the adoption of an early childhood development program , a national child care program . 
when we compare the government ' s commitments today with what was in the red book in 1993 , it seems to me that we are moving further and further away from any kind of program the government is committed to , to actually make child care a reality . 
in 1993 the Liberal Party promised 150,000 child care spaces . 
where are they ? 
six years have gone by . 
where are those child care spaces ? 
why are there tens of thousands of kids on waiting lists to get into child care ? 
less than 10 % of kids who need child care have access to the regulated spaces . 
the Liberal government has failed on that score . 
its national children ' s agenda is not worth anything more than the paper it is written on unless there is a substantive financial commitment by the government to work with the provinces to produce those child care spaces . 
i will touch on the issue of housing and homelessness . 
it is ironic that in the throne speech more time was devoted to the issue of endangered species than there was to the issue of people who are dying on our streets because of homelessness , or people who are living in totally inadequate housing . 
it is simply appalling that we have had a minister responsible for homelessness who has yet to produce a single unit of housing . 
it is appalling that in the throne speech there was not one specific commitment to say that the federal government will produce a national housing strategy . 
where is that commitment from the other side of the House ? 
where are the specifics ? 
where are the housing units that need to be developed ? 
when it comes to other members of society like students , again in the throne speech we heard platitudes and very lofty ideas about access to the Internet and the knowledge based economy . 
but what about the students who are trying to get through school ? 
what about the students who are suffering from a massive debt load ? 
has the Liberal government addressed that issue ? 
not one line in the throne speech has shown any understanding of the very harsh realities facing students who are trying to get through school . 
we were hoping to see a commitment to a national grants program , to a tuition freeze and to a recognition that post - secondary education should be accessible to all young people . 
that would be a real commitment to building our future , but instead we saw again the lofty ideas and the clouds passing by in the sky in terms of the Liberals ' ideas of what the future is . 
yes , we have had some announcement about parental leave but what about the eligibility requirements ? 
what are parents meant to do after that one year of leave ? 
where will the child care spaces be so that they can return to work ? 
after examining the throne speech and seeing exactly what is and is not there , then I would agree with my colleague for Winnipeg - Transcona that it is empty and vacuous . 
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , some 33 years ago I was a newcomer to this country . 
when I was growing up in Croatia I was poor . 
i came from a large family . 
i know what poverty is . 
listening to the speech today by the hon. member for Vancouver East I am a little confused . 
that is where poverty is , not in Canada . 
i am really surprised to hear the bashing of the Liberal government that it does not care about children and youth in Canada . 
i have four children . 
i did not expect any level of government to take care of them . 
i did not ask the government to provide me with early childhood benefits or whatnot . 
i had children with my wife because we wanted a family . 
we were and still are responsible parents . 
no one can deny that there are children who deserve and need support from governments . 
however , it is not at the level that the hon. member for Vancouver East was saying . 
the hon. member should not portray Canada as the worst place to live when she knows , as well as many of us in the House , that there are millions of people who would rather live here than in their own country . 
in the future , could the hon. member go across the country and see for herself how great the country really is ? 
Ms. Libby Davies : 
Mr. Speaker , I guess it is a matter of perspective of where we live and what our daily reality is as to whether or not this is a wonderful country . 
do not take it from me . 
i encourage the hon. member to read reports from organizations appointed by the government , such as the National Council on Welfare and the reports from the United Nations that have clearly condemned the Canadian government for its failure to address the abysmal conditions that aboriginal people live in . 
i have gone to reserves . 
i have gone to Metis communities . 
i have seen houses where people had no running water or no toilet . 
i do not think those people believe that they live in a wonderful country . 
they would like to have the same opportunities that maybe the member has had . 
when he says he did not expect the government to care for his children , I do not think any parent expects the government to care for his or her children . 
what Canadian families want to see are the kinds of community supports , programs and services , such as an early childhood development program and a national child care program , that will assist families in coping in what is increasingly a very difficult environment . 
i am frankly surprised to hear the member suggest that somehow we should not being doing that . 
to deny the reality that there are millions of Canadians who live below the poverty line , as described by Stats Canada , is simply to not deal with the truth of what goes on in our country . 
yes , there are people who are doing incredibly well and do not need any help whatsoever . 
however , there are very major issues of income distribution and of how wealth is distributed . 
if the member wants , I will take him to my riding and show him what happens when we leave people at the bottom , when we leave society to market forces and when the Liberal Party listens to the business elites and not to the real crowds . 
i will show him the evidence and the consequences of what that means on the streets . 
there are people without shelter and without adequate support . 
there are kids who are going hungry in school . 
the evidence is there and it is in every community in the country . 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Halton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to rise to address the throne speech and review briefly the six years of effort that have been put in by the government to bring our economy and the state of the country to where they are right now . 
i was particularly moved by the words of the hon. member for Cambridge who speaks from his heart about Canada and who , because of his life experience , is able to compare Canada with his country of origin . 
that says more about Canada today than any of the most eloquent speeches that could be made in the House . 
i was very interested that the Leader of Her Majesty ' s Loyal Opposition went on television after the throne speech and suggested that there were no specifics in the throne speech and therefore it was not acceptable . 
they are always speeches of vision . 
the specifics come afterward . 
the Prime Minister , in his response to the Speech from the Throne yesterday , began to put the specifics in place , but it was only the beginning . 
the next stage will be when the official budget comes out and that is due process . 
i hope that the hon. Leader of the Opposition over time and after gaining experience will realize that there are stages we go through . 
it has been six years that I have had the honour of serving in the House . 
we have now entered our third year of surplus budgeting and the deficit has been eliminated . 
that did not happen by accident or by magic . 
it happened with a very concerted effort and with the co - operation of Canadians from coast to coast . 
through the wisdom of our Minister of Finance , it also happened probably in the least painful way it could have . 
i must digress for a minute , Mr. Speaker , to advise you that I beg to share my time with the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra . 
i regret that I forgot to do so at the beginning of my speech . 
it is six years later and where are we today ? 
as the Prime Minister said , it is the first time in 50 years I believe that we have sustained a balanced budget or a budget that contains some surplus . 
we have been able to begin work on paying down the debt . 
we have made a commitment to never again allow the finances of the country to get into the state they were when we inherited them six years ago . 
personally , it has been a very challenging and satisfying time for me and I have been honoured to be here over this period . 
now we are in a new phase . 
it has been suggested that it is more difficult to govern with a surplus than it is with a deficit because once a surplus is seen then the demands come on to do certain things . 
we have made a choice on this side of the House which is to share the surplus by increasing the financial strength of the country and , at the same time , restoring those social efforts that have been a hallmark of Canada over the years . 
we will continue in that direction . 
it will not be sudden , but it will be measured and it will be responsible . 
tax reduction will be part of the strategy because it will put more money into consumers ' pockets . 
debt reduction will be part of the strategy because that allows for more tax reduction . 
the maintenance of a strong economy is essential if we are to move ahead with the restoration of those things which are very important to us , such as health care which is at the top of the agenda at the moment in people ' s minds in this country , and rightly so . 
with all of its warts and all of its weaknesses , it is still the best system . 
if we compare it first to the American system and see 40 million souls , greater than the whole population of Canada , without health care , or when we talk to some U.S. doctors , which I have had the pleasure of doing , and find out what it costs them to operate their health care system , we realize that we have never had it so good and that Canada has got something here . 
yes , it may be flawed , yes , it may be incomplete and yes , it needs improving , but it is there . 
i would remind those who would destroy our health care system of a very personal story about my mother who contracted pneumonia in 1941 and spent 14 weeks in the hospital , in the days before antibiotics I might add . 
my father spent the rest of his life paying off that debt . 
i suppose that is why I am considered to the right of centre in the Liberal caucus to a certain extent . 
however , I must tell the House that the health care system is paramount in the country . 
if we lost everything else , the health care system is a system we must maintain and continually improve . 
where are we going in the future ? 
we have an economy that is sustaining a surplus budget . 
we have a bottom line that is stronger than it has been in many years which has enabled us to move on . 
that is why we consider a children ' s agenda , for instance , to be of paramount importance . 
if we understand that early childhood development is a key to a successful life , then we in government must understand that whatever we can do to support that is positive to the future . 
i was also very impressed with our commitment to research and development . 
there will be 2,000 new chairs in universities to create centres of excellence which will allow Canada to express its brain power to an even greater extent than it does at the present time . 
as my friend from Cambridge said , Canada is the best country in the world . 
if anybody does not believe it , I suggest they go anywhere else . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that was quite an interesting speech . 
i would like to highlight a couple of points my hon. colleague made . 
it is the taxes that have been wrung out of individuals , to the tune of $ 6 billion from people making $ 20,000 a year or less , that have balanced the budget and reduced the deficit , not the Liberal government . 
the member also mentioned that Liberals are the defenders of health care . 
they are the slashers and burners of health care . 
how can he do that ? 
Mr. Julian Reed : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the hon. member must have missed what I said . 
i did point out that every Canadian participated in the recovery of this country . 
it was not painless . 
i can assure my hon. friend , who will probably never experience this , that hard decisions are hard decisions . 
however , they have been made and they work . 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to highlight something that was not mentioned in the member ' s presentation or in the throne speech and that is that there was very little about agriculture and what help needs to be given to that area . 
what was mentioned in the throne speech were two things that could very much threaten agriculture and add more burden to our farmers . 
one was to implement the Kyoto protocol , the proposed carbon tax and the increased input costs that would result for farmers . 
the other was endangered species protection legislation , something everybody believes we should have , but the approach the new environment minister has taken is a heavy handed approach that will not work and does not include the co - operation of all people . 
i would like the member to comment on those two aspects that could seriously further harm the agriculture sector in this country . 
Mr. Julian Reed : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to point out to the hon. member that the steps that have been taken by this government are helping the Kyoto protocol and agriculture at the same time . 
maybe the hon. member does not know that since the biomass - derived ethanol program has been put into place nearly $ 500,000 of private investment has taken place across Canada , and farmers produce the feedstock for that ethanol production . 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the 15 years that I have had the privilege to sit in the House of Commons I have listened to a few throne speeches and it seems to me that what we ought to be considering is putting an end to throne speeches . 
people expect everything to be put into a throne speech , that the government is to outline in great detail its plans for the future . 
in reality , most Canadians are completely tuned out to this whole debate because they realize it is laced with partisanship . 
i would like to ask the hon. member whether he believes that throne speeches are of any real value to Canadians from coast to coast . 
would he not agree that instead of beginning a new session of parliament with a throne speech that it would be far more advisable to begin a new session of parliament with a budget so that there would be a specific plan on the table in which Canadians could engage in a real debate about the future of Canada ? 
Mr. Julian Reed : 
Mr. Speaker , that is a very interesting proposition . 
however , I would like to point out , and I am sure my hon. friend would agree , that when the legislative process starts it has to start with something , the vision . 
the purpose of the throne speech , traditionally , has been to present that overall vision to the House and to the people of Canada . 
if we had started without that there would be no vision . 
we have been accused from time to time of having no vision at all . 
i would like the hon. member to remember what it would be like if we did have some vision . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I understand the impatience of some hon. members with antique customs . 
you sit in that very uncomfortable chair which you have inherited from many generations of people overgrown on roast beef and port wine and various other things . 
let us face it , there are traditions . 
the value of the speech from the throne today is simply that it gives a larger vision of a governmental program that necessarily will be computized when we have those financial figures , when we know how much of a surplus there is and the battle over the distribution of it can be carried down to the details . 
this could be upset , but it is generally agreed that if there is a surplus , and we think there will be a very considerable surplus , as a result , as hon. members might say on this side , of government policies , it will be split at a principle of 50 % for tax reductions and amortization of the external debt , and 50 % for social programs . 
this is something that my constituents have strongly favoured . 
they have also asked that tax reductions extend to the working middle class who are very capable of creating the jobs , more perhaps than any other section of the community . 
that is something I will be working on for my constituents . 
i think it is a necessary part of our program of creating jobs . 
the Speech from the Throne outlined the three main areas of our policies on the government side as we go into the new century . 
one is , as I say , the work on tax reduction and the amortization of the debt . 
the second is spending on health and social programs . 
the third , and I will say a few more words on this , is the investment in knowledge as the key to the next century . 
my first assignment as a member when I was elected was to get $ 167.5 million from the finance minister , who had just inherited in 1993 a $ 42.8 billion budget deficit . 
how does one make the argument ? 
i had to go to the rounds of my colleagues and ministers and explain that there was a thing called pure research , that it did not necessarily bring results tomorrow , but five or ten years down the line it opened jobs and industry . 
pure knowledge can be translated concretely into factories , into production and into the creation of skilled jobs . 
we won that particular battle . 
it was easier to do it than in relation to some of the things we are doing now because , of course , education , research in a strict sense , on old fashioned constitutional views , is outside federal power . 
education is our investment in the future . 
i take great pride in the achievements , in the centres for excellence , in the centres for innovation and in the culmination of scholarships for the 21 st century . 
of the professorships there will be 1,200 immediately and 2,000 afterward . 
the actual idea was put forward by the president of the University of British Columbia and by the recteur de l ' Universit é de Montr éal. 
the idea was " arrest the brain drain '' . 
in certain areas like biochemistry , particle physics , pharmacology , and I could go on , we lead North America . 
we have world standards , but we run the risk of losing our best and our brightest . 
these two university presidents put forward the idea of linking this to the centres for innovation that would be presided over by the former president of the University of British Columbia , Dr. Strangway . 
this is the idea . 
i would pay tribute to caucus , my own and those of opposition parties . 
i did an informal poll in the last parliament and found that 50 MPs had colleges or universities in their constituencies and 18 or 20 had been professors or teachers . 
that is a powerful lobby and a group that has brought this emphasis on knowledge , on the investment in knowledge as the key to the new century . 
the Speech from the Throne covers many things . 
i have highlighted the quest for knowledge and the investment in learning as the key to the next century . 
there are several other matters that I will touch on very briefly , such as hands across the border . 
we are moving more and more to removing that barrier with the United States , those irritating delays in customs and elsewhere for Canadian citizens . 
this in spite of some pressures put on us in terms of problems in controlling our own entry to Canada from elsewhere . 
the movement is there . 
we have built on the record in the difficult area of reconciling our tradition as a country that receives people who want a better life . 
there are the boat people we have taken in the past . 
there are the Vietnamese admitted by a decision of a Conservative government . 
that community is one of the best communities in terms of low rates of unemployment and investment in new job creation . 
i look at the Ismailis who came here in 1971 under Prime Minister Trudeau , and the people who came from Cyprus when it broke up . 
we have a commitment to receiving people who have the talent and the will to make a better life . 
there are aspects here that are in terms of our international obligations . 
there is nothing inhibiting the Canadian government under international law from applying appropriate controls to our immigration for speeding up the process of determination of refugee claimants . 
i ask all members to address that in the future . 
the Speaker : 
as it is 2 o ' clock , we will now proceed to Statements by Members . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
chancellor ROBERT S . K . WELCH 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to congratulate the chancellor of Brock University on a very special honour . 
on Saturday , October 16 , the Faculty of Education building will be named after the chancellor , Robert S . K . Welch , in recognition of his contribution to Brock University . 
chancellor Welch has a long history of public service and deep roots in the Niagara community . 
from his first years on the St. Catharines Board of Education , Chancellor Welch rose in provincial politics to head the education ministry and later to the position of deputy premier of Ontario . 
his many years of service were acknowledged when he was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada in 1994 . 
the naming of the faculty of education building is a way for Brock to honour a man who has given so much of his time and energy to the institution over the many years . 
i join with students , faculty and friends to honour the important work of Robert Welch and the dedication he has shown for education in Niagara and in Ontario . 
the Speaker : 
i very rarely add anything to statements made by members , but I know Mr. Welch and it is an honour well deserved . 
he is one of the truly great people of that part of the country . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we support that as well . 
this week , as most Canadians celebrated Thanksgiving Day , Canadian farmers had little to celebrate . 
devastated by conditions beyond their control , farmers have been hit by the worst farm income crisis in recent memory and they have been abandoned by this government . 
this year thanksgiving did not make it to the farm . 
what did make it to the farm were record high input costs , record low commodity prices , increasing U.S. protectionism resulting in unjust tariffs against Canadian producers , bankruptcies that are erasing the next generation of family farms , and misguided and inadequate Liberal government contracts . 
it is time to reform aid programs to deliver assistance to farmers in need . 
it is time to give farmers the freedom to market their products as they choose . 
it is time for a government that will stand up for the farmers at the international trade table . 
* * * 
hazardous WASTE 
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , over the past five years hazardous waste imports from the United States into Ontario have nearly tripled . 
such imports include explosive chemicals , solvents , arsenic , mercury , benzene and other substances that can pose a threat to public health and the environment . 
regulations in Ontario are such that United States companies find it cheaper to ship their hazardous waste to Ontario rather than dispose of it at home . 
the federal government has signed the Basel convention and therefore has a responsibility for the safe disposal of hazardous waste coming across the border . 
therefore I urge the Government of Canada to exercise its authority under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and set strict conditions on the imports of hazardous waste into Canada so as to ensure an environmentally safe disposal . 
* * * 
the LATE ROSS HALL 
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Stoney Creek , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with regret that I rise to inform the House of the passing of Ross Hall , a talented leader who died October 11 at West Lincoln Memorial Hospital in Grimsby . 
he led by example and treated all with a sense of respect and understanding . 
our community has truly lost a model citizen . 
he will be missed . 
i ask hon. colleagues to please join with me in offering our sympathy to Ross ' wife Alison and his family at this very difficult time . 
* * * 
the LATE WILLIAM KAYE LAMB 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to commemorate the passing of William Kaye Lamb , librarian extraordinaire , who organized our nation ' s history as founder of the National Library of Canada . 
born on May 11 , 1904 in New Westminster , British Columbia , he died August 24 , 1999 in Vancouver at 95 years . 
prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1948 appointed him dominion archivist . 
lamb then created the National Library and drafted the National Library Act of 1952 . 
he proposed Canada ' s National Library and Archives which opened in 1967 . 
before retiring from the National Library in 1969 , he oversaw the first computerized library catalogue in the country . 
in his last days , a chief joy was sending out his trademark typewritten memos to fellow scholars . 
though work took him all over the world , a piece of him will always be in Ottawa . 
he will be remembered as a British Columbian who was a great builder of Canada . 
* * * 
auto PACT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the World Trade Organization issued an interim ruling ordering Canada to scrap the auto pact , the latest casualty of the Liberal government ' s liberalization at any cost trade policy . 
the auto pact is a model of fair managed trade providing auto manufacturers with duty free access to Canadian markets on the condition that they make significant investments in Canadian jobs and communities . 
the auto pact has played a key role in the creation of family supporting jobs in the manufacturing sector . 
auto companies working within the rules of the auto pact employ eight times as many workers in Canada as those who do not . 
the Liberals say they care about the auto pact but it was these same Liberals who negotiated the rules which the WTO is now using to kill the auto pact . 
it was these same Liberals who assured Canadians that the auto pact would be safeguarded . 
it is incumbent on the Liberals now to find a way to uphold the principles of the auto pact and support Canadian jobs . 
it must appeal the WTO ruling , rethink its uncritical and simplistic commitment to free trade , and failing all this , develop equivalent policies that reward auto manufacturers for investing in Canadian jobs and communities . 
* * * 
arts AND CULTURE 
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased that Canadian culture figures so prominently in the Speech from the Throne . 
the throne speech set out a global strategy to build a better quality of life for all Canadians and to implement policies that make a difference in the lives of individual Canadians . 
writers , singers , actors , filmmakers and artists breathe life into our culture while others record our history and protect our cultural heritage . 
this reaffirms the government ' s commitment to culture , linking 1,000 institutions across the country to form a virtual museum , putting collections on line , increasing support for the production of Canadian stories and images in print , theatre , music and video . 
* * * 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week , Quebec lost one of its greatest artists , actor Jean - Louis Millette , who had raised his art to the heights of intensity . 
everything Jean - Louis Millette undertook grew to significant proportions reflecting his talent . 
he approached each work with integrity , generosity and humanity . 
humble and simple , he served the author , charmed the public , and was respected by his colleagues . 
his talent universally acclaimed , he moved us in the theatre , on television and in film . 
the emotion he left us will survive him . 
the emotion he shared with children , through his Paillasson character , is forever in our hearts . 
while an actor ' s work is essentially ephemeral , Jean - Louis Millette ' s interpretations remain . 
we thank you , Jean - Louis Millette , for all the joy you brought us . 
* * * 
OKTOBERFEST 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , during this past weekend Kitchener - Waterloo welcomed thousands of visitors from across the continent to kick off the 31 st annual Oktoberfest celebrations . 
in fact members of this House came to Kitchener to join in the great German tradition . 
this nine day festival is the largest Bavarian celebration in North America with the greatest Thanksgiving Day parade in Canada . 
Oktoberfest has become an important cultural event for our nation . 
it symbolizes what it is like to live in a multicultural nation . 
i congratulate the over 400 volunteers who make Oktoberfest such a great success each year . 
in particular I recognize the hard work of Oktoberfest president Auggie Sherban . 
he should be commended for his outstanding commitment and dedication to this important cultural event . 
* * * 
children 
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) : 
in short , our vision and focus is our children . 
imagine the legacy . 
we will ensure an increase in the quality of life for our children . 
sadly , not everyone agrees with this vision of investing in our children . 
for reasons which I suspect are for political gain , the leader of the Reform Party suggests this is nothing more than fluff , no real substance , I think he said . 
let me inform the leader of the Reform Party that my children are not mere fluff . 
we can only assume his comments will continue to be damaging to himself and to our children . 
* * * 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , three years ago Reform ' s finance critic at the time , Herb Grubel , told me that the best primer on economics was a book called Man and Economics by Robert Mundell . 
believe it or not , I checked all the major bookstores in Canada and could not find it . 
finally by a happy coincidence I found Mr. Mundell ' s book in the discard bin in the public library in the little town where I live . 
and yes it is a wonderful lucid book . 
Robert Mundell was a man in advance of his age . 
he was a prophet without honour in his own country until yesterday . 
yesterday Robert Mundell , born in Kingston , Ontario and raised in the interior of B.C. , was awarded the Nobel prize for economics . 
today governments around the world are applying his supply side tax cut ideas and their economies are booming and providing their citizens with jobs and prosperity , including right here in Ontario . 
on behalf of the official opposition , we extend hearty congratulations to Canada ' s Robert Mundell . 
finally I would like to offer a copy of the book to the finance minister , as long as he will read it and give it back to me . 
* * * 
community CARE WORKER WEEK 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to remind the House and all Canadians that the week of October 11 to 17 is Community Care Worker Week . 
the professionals , paraprofessionals and volunteers who provide health care in the community are an integral part of our health care system . 
they are the front line workers providing home care , long term institutional care , meal distribution services and community support programs . 
to acknowledge the invaluable contribution workers make to the health of Canadians , the Canadian Association for Community Care together with Lifeline Systems Canada has initiated the Community Care Worker Award which is presented every year during Community Care Worker Week . 
i invite you to join me in thanking community care workers throughout Canada for their contribution to the health of Canadians . 
* * * 
world DAY FOR THE REFUSAL OF MISERY 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October 17 has been proclaimed World Day for the refusal of misery by the United Nations . 
this day will stress the exclusion and isolation experienced on a daily basis by an increasing number of women , men and children , while also urging us to take a hard look at our way of doing things , so as to eliminate this wall of shame for our society . 
beyond any statistical consideration , poverty means being excluded from any form of full participation as a citizen ; it means that one cannot participate in the benefits of economic growth and it also suppresses the fundamental right to work . 
poverty means the outright withdrawal of freedom of speech for those who are affected by it . 
tackling poverty is an enormous challenge . 
we must do so with determination , with our heads high , and we must not be afraid of telling things as they are , while being receptive to those who live in poverty . 
* * * 
liberal GOVERNMENT 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as we begin this new session , let us take a look at the parties in the House of Commons . 
as for the Bloquistes , they have yet to find a reason to exist except , perhaps , their pensions , unlike the Liberal government , which knows exactly where it is headed . 
the Liberals are governing according to the priorities of Canadians , so as to provide them with a better economic , social and political future . 
congratulations to the Liberal government . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the supreme court ruling on the hunting and fishing rights of native Canadians , a crisis has grown in the lobster fishery on the east coast . 
parliament must act immediately to demonstrate the leadership that the federal government has failed to provide . 
i urgently request the agreement of all parties to facilitate the immediate reinstatement of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans . 
the committee should immediately go first to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia where tensions are tearing traditionally peaceful communities apart along racial lines . 
let us hear directly from those involved , accept the responsibility entrusted to us and seek to establish a constructive environment for agreement . 
we all want a peaceful solution . 
the PC Party of Canada is prepared to take this action . 
i call on all my caucus colleagues and all members of the House to join us in - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Saanich - Gulf Islands . 
* * * 
WILLIAM HEAD INSTITUTION 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , convicted wife killer , Patrick Lees , has just begun his sentence at William Head prison in Victoria . 
inmates refer to William Head as Club Fed. 
why ? 
the inmates reside in condominiums , no steel bars , no locks on the doors , many of the bedrooms have TVs and VCRs and each condo has its own living room , dining room and kitchen . 
let us not forget its waterfront location equipped with golf course , fishing pier and much more . 
spousal abuse is a huge problem in our society . 
Patrick Lees violently murdered his wife , left two young children without a mom and now we see this wife killer sent to Club Fed. 
there is a place in the system for institutions where inmates must learn to care for themselves . 
however , prisoners must earn the right to transfer to these institutions . 
i am working on a private member ' s bill where an inmate would not be eligible for this type of institution until they have completed at least 50 % of their time . 
i urge all members to work with me to change the system . 
* * * 
presence IN GALLERY 
the Speaker : 
colleagues , I am going to change things just a little bit for today . 
i want to draw to your attention the presence in the gallery of Her Excellency Libuse Benesova , President of the Senate of the Czech Republic , and her parliamentary delegation . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
fisheries 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
thirty years ago when the Prime Minister was minister of Indian affairs he professed to believe that assigning rights to different people based on their race would only lead to further discrimination , recrimination and the kinds of violence that we see now in New Brunswick . 
why has the prime minister and his government abandoned that position ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I said in the House of Commons that treaties were signed by the government of the day , by Her Majesty the Queen of England at that time . 
we have an obligation to respect the treaty that was entered into by previous governments , particularly with the natives . 
these agreements were signed . 
the supreme court passed a judgment and we have to respect that within the confines of the judgment that gave collective rights . 
we have the right to impose measures to maintain the conservation that is needed so that stocks can be there for years to come . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
what the supreme court should have been doing in the Marshall case is balancing these rights not just affirming one side . 
why does the Prime Minister not take control of this situation , ask the supreme court to stay its decision and return to a fisheries policy that is based on equality under the law and conservation not race ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the treaties were signed with the natives of the day . 
it is an obligation of the government and of the nation to respect the obligation that we have taken with them . 
there was a judgment by the supreme court that said that it is a collective right that has to be managed within the need for conservation . 
this is exactly what the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is working on at this moment . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is not listening to what is being said . 
no one is denying the fact of aboriginal rights . 
however , the government , under its constitutional authority for the fishery , has also granted rights to others to fish . 
that is what a fishing licence is . 
what we are looking for is some leadership from the government in balancing these rights . 
i ask the Prime Minister again , why does he not ask the supreme court for a stay of this judgment and why does he not come up with a fishery policy that recognizes equality under the law not special entitlement simply based on race ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , these rights have been confirmed by the court . 
the Leader of the Opposition takes pleasure in saying that he respects the rights but does not want the judgment implemented . 
that is like having your cake and eating it at the same time . 
some licences have been granted for a long time , but this judgment adds new fishermen to the business . 
this has to be worked out in conjunction with those who were there before and those who have new authority from the supreme court to use their fishing rights . 
we have to get the two parties together . 
to have your cake and eat it all the time like the leader - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Delta - South Richmond . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the purpose of asking for a stay of judgment is to ask the court to clarify its decision . 
the month long window to petition the court to stay this decision and clarify it is up in three days . 
so far the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Prime Minister have opted to allow chaos and violence to determine the course of events . 
is the Prime Minister now so comfortable with a race based fisheries policy that he will not even ask the supreme court to clarify its decision ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , every time there is a conclusion by the courts that the natives of Canada were here before , they always refer to it as a racist situation . 
they were here before we were . 
the king of the day told the settlers who were coming to Canada to make treaties with them . 
it is our obligation to respect the words of Her Majesty the Queen of those days . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me give the Prime Minister examples . 
it is unclear what the supreme court means by a modest living or whether non - status natives will enjoy this preferential right to fish that is allowed by the Marshall decision . 
flawed as it is , this decision needs clarification to establish the place of non - aboriginal fishermen in this fishery , fishermen whose families have been fishing these waters for 200 and 300 years . 
why is the government refusing to return court for clarification of this irresponsible and unrealistic decision ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the judgment has been rendered . 
we have to live with the judgment . 
we are obliged to respect judgments . 
we can ask for a stay to gain some time to plan a proper regime . 
however , whenever some rights are recognized for the first people of the land , the Reform Party always attacks them as racist . 
it is absolutely not Canadian .

GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Minister of Industry called Quebec Minister Landry irresponsible for putting forward a plan to save the only automobile plant in Quebec , the GM plant in Boisbriand and , with it , thousands of jobs in the region , when there are 14 such plants in Ontario . 
how can the minister make such statements ? 
and when he does , is he not behaving more like Ontario ' s Minister of Industry than the federal Minister of Industry ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting that the Bloc Quebecois is so in favour of an offer for a company such as this , which has made phenomenal profits . 
in Montreal , La Presse asked the question of the day , that is : " Quebec is prepared to put up $ 360 million to save GM in Boisbriand . 
do you think it should ? " 
and 19 % said yes , while 81 % said no . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is not much of an answer . 
it does show , however , that the Liberals are well organized when it comes to contacting La Presse . 
this morning , I spoke to Luc Desnoyers , Quebec ' s delegate to the CAW . 
i also spoke with the president of the union at the GM plant in Boisbriand . 
both said that the minister was dragging his feet , that he had done nothing for the cause , and that he was doing nothing to defend Quebec ' s workers . 
i ask the Prime Minister , who talks to us about collaboration , partnership and understanding , how he can stand by and watch his minister do absolutely nothing to help save the Boisbriand plant . 
it is a disgrace . 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is not true that we are not doing anything . 
in fact , it was the Government of Canada that first sat down with the Boisbriand workers . 
we were the ones who funded the project to put together a presentation for GM officials . 
we were the ones who carried the case forward with the GM officials in Detroit . 
i personally arranged a meeting with the president of GM in the United States , in Detroit , and invited Premier Bouchard to attend , just as Mr. Harris had gone to Seattle a few months ago to talk with Boeing . 
Mr. Bouchard sent Mr. Landry . 
together , we discussed the future of the Boisbriand project with GMr . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we learned from this morning ' s La Presse that the automotive manufacturers are being offered some extremely attractive incentives to stay in the U.S. or to develop new plants there . 
we learned also that Bernard Landry has made an interesting proposal as part of the efforts being made on the North American continent to save the Montreal plant . 
does the Minister of Industry seriously think he is going to be believed when he says he has done everything to save GM , when he has in fact stood back with his arms crossed , to all intents and purposes , for some time ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , does the hon. member seriously think that offering a lot of money before any demands are even made is a good negotiating approach ? 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , like the rest of Canada , Quebec has to compete internationally , and we need to be proactive when it comes to saving jobs . 
Bernard Landry was proactive . 
he sought a way of saving the plant . 
it would be nice to be able to say the same of the minister . 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is absolutely false , because we , the Government of Canada , are the ones who tried to help GM find solutions for Boisbriand . 
he does not understand that the problem is not a financial one . 
it is not a problem that could be solved with a donation from the taxpayers to a highly profitable company . 
it is a matter of finding a model , a future for a project . 
why has GM invested money in Ontario without getting any federal funds , as have other automobile manufacturers ? 
why ?

agriculture 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister . 
the federal government ' s response to the farm income crisis has been a disaster . 
for Saskatchewan and Manitoba farmers AIDA has been a disaster . 
less than half of those needing help qualify , and for those who do the payments are too low . 
most provincial ministers of agriculture are in Ottawa today . 
will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to admit that AIDA has been a disaster and announce a plan that will work for prairie farmers ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I met with the ministers of agriculture from two western provinces today . 
i reminded them of the money that has been put into the AIDA program . 
we made changes to crop insurance . 
we made changes to the NISA program . 
we made changes to the AIDA program and we continue to look for all the resources we possibly can . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
now the Prime Minister ducks the question . 
i think we heard that from a previous Liberal prime minister as well . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am following the situation very closely . 
that is why we are working with the ministers . 
it is the crisis that is a problem . 
long before the leader of the party was aware of the problem money was already on the table to solve the crisis .

fisheries 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stated in the House " We have a solution in place and we have a plan '' . 
he was referring to the fishery . 
while he was saying that , the aboriginal leaders were meeting in Moncton , New Brunswick . 
last night when I informed the minister that the chiefs had decided to shut down the moratorium , he stated that he had not been contacted by the chiefs . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
given that the chiefs have now stated that they have no trust in the minister of fisheries , will the Prime Minister personally accept responsibility for this situation and step in immediately to resolve it ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is important to look at the facts . 
the moratorium was on a voluntary basis by the chiefs . 
what has happened now is they have said that they will leave it up to the individual chiefs . 
i talked to Chief Sark today from Lennox Island and he said he would continue with the moratorium . 
it is left up to the individual chiefs to decide on their own . 
we have a plan for the short term and the long term . 
it is working and I will continue with it . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week when the minister of fisheries went to Halifax to try to negotiate a settlement for the crisis in the fishery , the minister could not get an agreement . 
in fact the agreement came from the chiefs themselves . 
today , because of the actions of the minister ' s department , the voluntary moratorium which restored peace to our communities back east has now collapsed . 
native leaders now say they simply cannot trust the minister , and that was their quote . 
my question is for the Prime Minister . 
does the Prime Minister understand that the number one barrier to a negotiated solution to this issue is his own minister ? 
i am begging the Prime Minister to step into this situation and deal with it . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we should make sure we understand the facts . 
i met with the processors . 
i was there to listen to them , to make sure we had a dialogue . 
as a result of the discussions the chiefs decided on their own that they wanted to have a voluntary moratorium . 
it is always hard to get 35 chiefs to agree to a unanimous decision . 
they have decided now that they will leave it up to individual chiefs . 
some chiefs will continue with it .

agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with all the agriculture minister says that he has done for farmers , why are thousands of dirt poor farmers still getting nothing , no cash ? 
to date the government has done nothing to address the crisis in any serious way . 
AIDA does not work and there is no replacement in sight . 
families are losing their farms right now , not tomorrow , and the government sits idly by . 
why is the Prime Minister allowing our farmers to head into winter with no hope and no cash ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I find these comments very interesting , coming from an hon. member who stood in the public a year ago and said farmers should stop their crying . 
the government knew that farmers needed help . 
we have put $ 900 million there . 
we have made changes to the net income stabilization program that enabled the withdrawal of more than $ 120 million in that program . 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Selkirk - Interlake . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the agriculture minister is a liar . 
i did not say - 
some hon. members : 
withdraw , withdraw . 
the Speaker : 
i ask the hon. member to please withdraw that statement . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
Yes. 
i recognize , Mr. Speaker , that is not an appropriate statement .

GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , whatever the Minister of Industry may say or do , he is not helping matters with his attitude and his remarks . 
my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
given his attitude , are we not totally justified in asking whether he does not intend to sacrifice the Boisbriand plant in favour of plants in Ontario , his home province ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that question is totally strange , because , as I said , we worked with GM to save jobs at Boisbriand . 
in fact , another car model needs to be found for manufacture at Boisbriand . 
i told him that significant investments have been made in the Canadian automobile industry in the past five or six years . 
there has never been a need for the federal government to invest because we are very competitive . 
at Boisbriand , the employees are top quality and highly trained and could compete with - 
the Speaker : 
the member for T é miscamingue . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in its throne speech , the government mentions partnership a lot . 
we did not think there would be an example so soon . 
i would like the Prime Minister to say whether he does not consider the example and the attitude of his minister with regard Boisbriand do not reveal the essence of the word partnership . 
is that what partnership means ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
he did a very good job , but , as he has said , the problem right now is that major changes are being made in the whole of the GM organization throughout North America , and Boisbriand is in competition with the others . 
investments have been made in Canada , and at no time in the automobile industry in recent years have we - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. leader of the Reform Party . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government ' s response to the western farm crisis is an absolute insult to western Canada . 
the realized net income for all farmers in Manitoba and Saskatchewan collectively will be down by 98 % for the four year average . 
does the Prime Minister understand that 98 % means down from $ 916 million a year to $ 16 million ? 
the government ' s response to date has been pathetic : an aid program that does not work , an income stabilization program that does not work , and no high level attack on the European subsidies which are at the root of the problem . 
when will the Prime Minister take some personal interest and show some personal leadership - 
the Speaker : 
the Right Hon. Prime Minister . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
that is what they say to gain votes . 
now that we have put money on the table they just flip - flop completely and want us to spend money when - 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
i would ask both the questioners and those who answer to please keep their questions within 35 seconds . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister should have kept on reading from that statement because the next sentences talked about Reform ' s proposal for a trade distortion program that would have solved this problem . 
incidentally the member who proposed that program is now just about five seats away from becoming the premier of Saskatchewan . This is not just about statistics . 
this is not a statistical problem . 
it is families that are suffering not just the loss of their livelihoods but their farms - 
the Speaker : 
if the Prime Minister wants to address himself to the preamble , I would invite him to do so . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will reply in 90 seconds and not in 90 minutes . 
before the last budget the government put $ 900 million on the table and the provinces put $ 600 million directed toward this problem . 
why does the Reform Party complain all the time when we spend money ? 
now he wants to cut money and have a new program . 
he cannot have it that way .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Onex issue , the Minister of Transport is now prepared , after having suspended application of the Competition Act and after having refused to let the transport committee sit during the summer , to set aside the 10 % ownership rule . 
is the strange behaviour of the minister in this matter dictated by the cozy relationship that exists between Onex and his government ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said yesterday , it became quite evident over the last few months that Canadian Airlines was in trouble . 
it either needed a cash injection from the government , in other words a bailout , or we had to let it slide into insolvency or we had to find another way to solve the problem . 
we invoked section 47 which allows us to find market driven solutions but which also allows the government and parliament to pronounce upon any agreement that comes forward with shareholders and to set conditions in the public interest . 
i have enunciated five principles . 
i said them yesterday and I could say them again , but the government will do what is in the best interest of Canadians . 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the president of Onex , Mr. Schwartz , also said that the delays imposed by the Competition Bureau would , in his opinion , be too long . 
can the minister tell us whether or not , and regardless of the opinion of the president of Onex , this transaction will be reviewed by the Competition Bureau ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , under section 47 , which we use , the Competition Bureau is engaged . 
in fact it is giving us advice on restructuring and that advice will be made available within the next couple of weeks and certainly will be made public . 
the fact is that the Competition Bureau ' s role is one that has been underlined . 
it is still there and it will still be involved in any consideration . 
as to any specific agreement , I do not believe that it is my role to talk about any proposal that is now before the shareholders of a private company . 
when that company decides , when the shareholders decide , then the government will act in the public interest . 
* * * 
government CONTRACTS 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Claude Gauthier , owner of Transelec , donated $ 10,000 to the Prime Minister ' s campaign after winning a CIDA contract . 
he then bought a $ 500,000 piece of land from a company in which the Prime Minister has a financial interest and the bidding for that was , shall we say , suspicious . 
it turns out that Transelec is not quite doing the job and the government has been worried about being on the hook ever since . 
why is the Prime Minister putting his political interest ahead of the public interest ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first , CIDA does not hold the contract with Transelec . 
the contract is held between the government of the African Republic of Mali and Transelec . 
second , CIDA funds the project and pays the bills according to the Mali government , as they are submitted . 
third , this company ' s bid was 30 % lower than the next lowest bid . 
the project will be finished in the near future and it will be done at no additional cost . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
what a steal of a deal , Mr. Speaker . 
that is great comfort . 
let me paint a clearer picture for the Prime Minister himself . 
the minister talks about the awarding process and the process for bidding . 
it was certainly suspicious at the very least . 
it is a process for a pal . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
i would urge members on both sides to be very judicious in their choice of words . 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
i would just say that when somebody makes a bid 30 % lower than the others , when it is the lowest bid , $ 3 million lower than the others , I think the government of Mali did pretty well in giving the contract to that contractor .

parental LEAVE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one of the most popular measures mentioned in the throne speech is the proposal to double the length of parental leave . 
this is good news . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te : 
it is good news , and we all agree on that , but why will this measure come into effect in 2001 and not now ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , recognizing the changing relationship between the workforce and Canadian families , this government knows that it is appropriate for parents to be at home in the early years with their children . 
yesterday the Prime Minister announced a doubling of parental benefits for Canadian families . 
that is a significant investment in our children and in our families , and are we ever proud . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food . 
yesterday the WTO issued a ruling on Canada ' s imports and exports of milk . 
can the minister tell us whether this in any way threatens our excellent system of supply management for dairies ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
we were very pleased with the tariff rate quotas for fluid milk . 
the appellant body overthrew the ruling of the panel on that in Canada ' s favour . 
a little portion of the export of dairy products from Canada will be affected by the ruling , but the dairy industry itself has said that it is all right , they can adjust to that little portion , which does not affect supply management in Canada . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when the Prime Minister took office he failed to disclose under conflict of interest guidelines a $ 200,000 asset owed to his numbered company . 
his same company later happened to benefit from a land sale to the lucky winner of a huge CIDA contract , land enriched by a government grant to a nearby hotel . 
what was the Prime Minister trying to hide by not disclosing the $ 200,000 asset ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , everybody knows about it . 
i have been informed that the person who owed the money has paid it all . 
there is no debt any more . 
i filed the form as it was presented to me and there was no such request . 
but if we have to declare when we deposit $ 5 in the bank that the bank owes us $ 5 , probably we would have to write it in the form the next time . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
it was an asset which he did not disclose under his own conflict of interest guidelines . 
the Prime Minister must know how important it is to the Canadian public that they have confidence in his ethical standards . 
if his behaviour is above reproach , why has he refused to table the documents which will lay all of these questions to rest ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the trustee is managing this problem . 
the government has given a clear indication that there was no such request from anybody . 
my trustee was given all the assets and managed them . 
i pray to God that when I am not Prime Minister 10 years from now there will still be some assets that I can get . 
* * * 
child CARE 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech passed over Canadian children rather quickly by neglecting to mention any concrete plans for national child care . 
Canadian children need good quality care , not just in the first year of life but in all of their pre - school years . 
will the minister commit today to a national child care program that her government promised six years ago ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
it was part of our program . 
we wanted to do that , but all the provinces , including the NDP governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan , refused to have a joint program on day care . 
we found another way to help families and we were successful . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is trying to get off the hook . 
the fact is that when it comes to kids the government is full of bafflegab . 
let us try to get a clear answer . 
does the Prime Minister understand that a so - called children ' s agenda is worthless unless it includes child care ? 
will the minister and the Prime Minister remember that children have to be included in a children ' s agenda ? 
when are we going to see the national child care program ? 
exactly where are the 150,000 spaces that were promised ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just explained that the NDP governments of the land rejected the offer we made to them . 
with the refusal of the so - called left governments , which are to the right of the Liberal Party , we found other ways , through tax exemptions and other tax incentives , to help families because we were more preoccupied about child care than the NDP governments .

fisheries 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is the minister ' s record up to now in the east coast lobster crisis : no moratorium , homes burned , businesses destroyed , neighbour fighting neighbour , and 200 years of harmony between natives and non - natives jeopardized . 
the fear and uncertainty in this free - for - all continues . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that hon. members recognize the difficult situation . 
that is why we have to be careful not to inflame the situation . 
we have set forward a short term plan as well as a long term plan . 
i think what we have to do now is work toward ensuring that the aboriginal community can exercise that treaty right toward a long term plan . 
that is exactly what we are doing . 
i am encouraged by all of the co - operation that is happening at the community level . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just cited the minister ' s record on the short term plan . 
it is a disaster . 
we have eighth generation fishermen whose livelihood is threatened . 
there is a crisis in the community and the minister talks about a plan that does not exist . 
if the minister does have a plan , can he show us what that plan is ? 
the only plan the minister has now is a plan for continued chaos . 
will the minister act , and act quickly ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , we are already acting . 
my colleagues and I are working as a government to make sure that we have a dialogue , we have co - operation and we bring people together . 
the real solutions are at the community base , where people start talking to people , coming up with real solutions for the long term . 
that is exactly what we are doing .

child CARE 
Mr. John O ' Reilly ( Haliburton - Victoria - Brock , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in light of the recent announcement by the Prime Minister that parental leave will be extended from six months to one full year , can the Minister of Human Resources Development tell this House what effect this decision will have on working Canadians ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the daily Le Devoir writes " After some difficult years , Ottawa wants to take advantage of its sound fiscal position to improve parental leave . 
bravo '' . 
Mr. Speaker , we deliver .

employment 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
why has the minister ' s department not put in place a strategy to assure Canada ' s auto workers that their jobs are safe , knowing the likely result of this ruling ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the member of my full confidence in the automobile industry of this country . 
it is a strong and very healthy industry . 
yesterday we received a confidential interim report , which could be seen in the Globe and Mail this morning as well as a number of others papers . 
it is a 400 page report . 
we are looking into it . 
we are analyzing it . 
we will continue to have very close consultations with the stakeholders and with the provinces as well .

native PEOPLES 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
yesterday , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced that 33 out of 35 band councils had agreed to the moratorium . 
today , the number is zero . 
we are in troubled waters and the one voice we do not hear is that of the new Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs . 
i give him an opportunity to explain . 
since his government and the supreme court have confirmed the right of native peoples to a regulated fishery , why is the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs not negotiating his own moratorium with them and offering them compensation ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday we will be having a meeting with all the partners . 
the partners , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I are working on a long term plan and I hope to announce it next week . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I should remind the government that there is no lobster fishery going on in the Rideau Canal . 
this is day 27 after the Marshall decision and there is still no leadership from this government . 
the Prime Minister himself said the parties have to get together . 
instead of hiding behind government bureaucrats in Ottawa , why are the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans not down in the maritime region right now dealing with the stakeholders ? 
why are they not committing the necessary resources to meet the negotiations before something comes up that we cannot handle ? 
will the minister commit today to go down to the maritime region ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am here answering his question . 
the answer to it is they will be coming here on Monday .

fisheries 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the rejection of the 30 day moratorium on fishing in the Atlantic region shows clearly that the minister is continuing to ignore the seriousness of the situation . 
this government has shown the people most directly concerned that it has absolutely no leadership . 
through its clumsy handling of the situation , the government has struck fear into the hearts of fishers in towns and villages throughout Atlantic Canada . 
what has the government done and what does it intend to do to restore a feeling of security and peace of mind to people in native and non - native communities ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious the member was not listening to the answer just given a few minutes ago . 
we are working on a long term plan . 
we are meeting with the aboriginal community . 
i think the hon. member will be able to check that what we said earlier answers the question pretty clearly .

business OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is great that I get a question . 
at least once a week I am assured of this . 
i would like to ask the government House leader , who has all of this wisdom about what is coming up in the House of Commons , what the nature of the legislation is for the remainder of this week and next week . 
i would also like to know whether or not the government is going to stop the legislation coming forth on the Nisga ' a agreement because as you know , Mr. Speaker , we are prepared to fight , fight , fight on that issue . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am equally pleased to answer the question because it is once a week when I get to answer a question . 
today , tomorrow and Monday we will continue with the address debate . 
there will be votes at the end of the day today , as well as at the end of the day on Monday on the main amendment to the throne speech . 
on Tuesday morning we will have the debate on my motion to refer Bill C - 2 , the elections legislation , to committee before second reading . 
this debate may last up to three hours . 
once it is completed , we will consider the electronic commerce bill that will be reintroduced tomorrow . 
in the last session that bill was Bill C - 54 . 
i expect the debate on this bill will carry us through the rest of the day on Tuesday and possibly as late as next Wednesday . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the government House leader with respect to government business and the legislative agenda . 
the government House leader will recall that the government made a commitment in the last session of parliament to bring in legislation with respect to a national ban on the bulk export of water . 
there was no mention of this in the throne speech but it had at one time or another been indicated that it might be part of the legislative calendar . 
i wonder if the government House leader can tell us , will there be such legislation and when will it be forthcoming ? 
the Speaker : 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as I know it is still the plan of the government to introduce such legislation in the fall sitting of this parliament . 
as to an exact date , there are ongoing consultations between House leaders . 
i will inform my colleagues as soon as possible . 
at the present time it is still part of the fall legislative agenda . 
the Speaker : 
before I recognize the member for York South - Weston , I would simply remind him that this has to do with legislation being put forth by the government for the House to consider in the next week . 
with that in mind , I turn the floor over to the member for York South - Weston . 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister indicated that it is the plan of the government to send the elections bill to committee before second reading . 
that is an unusual procedure to follow . 
there are established rules in the House that require a second reading debate before a bill is referred to committee . 
could the minister explain why he is taking this unusual route with this bill ? 
the Speaker : 
this is part of our body of rules right now . 
it is my understanding the minister will make known his reasons . 
when he introduces the bill he will be the first speaker . 
it is part of our body of rules and as I understand it has been since 1997 . 
an hon. member : 
since 1993 . 
the Speaker : 
i will check into it . 
i was told it was 1997 .

privilege 
CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to make what I consider to be a very serious question of privilege . 
this question of privilege arises from a lawsuit that was launched against me in 1996 but does not pertain to the actions of the individual who filed the lawsuit . 
rather it concerns the activities and conduct of a government agency , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , during the course of this lawsuit . 
to begin , I want to say that I do not question the established precedent that prevents a member from using privilege to guard against the lawsuit for what is said outside of the House . 
this question of privilege has absolutely nothing to do with that . 
instead , I will provide prima facie evidence to the Chair that demonstrates how the conduct and activities of CSIS regarding this case form what I believe to be a new and disturbing method of intimidation of a member of parliament . 
i will show that CSIS improperly collected information and then subsequently disclosed that information in clear violation of CSIS policy to a third party . 
i will show that CSIS abandoned the traditional non - partisan role of the public service by taking an active role in the preparation of a lawsuit against an opposition member of parliament , including having its legal counsel provide the plaintiff and the plaintiff ' s lawyer with advice . 
finally , I will show that CSIS misused its extraordinary authority to protect national security , was twice sanctioned for misconduct and deliberately misled the court to frustrate my ability to resolve the lawsuit . 
thus the gist of my question of privilege is the deliberate effort of CSIS to intimidate me from speaking freely in the House of Commons and from performing my role as official opposition critic . 
i raise this issue today because this is the first opportunity to do so since the completion of my court case . 
although the standing orders state that the sub judice convention only applies in a civil lawsuit during the trial days of the proceedings , I undertook an agreement with the Board of Internal Economy not to utilize this lawsuit for political purposes . 
at the time I entered into that agreement , I was unaware of the role that CSIS had played in the case up to that time , nor could I possibly have envisioned the role that CSIS would subsequently take in this case . 
i have lived up to my obligation with the BOIE and have bided my time until today , my opportunity to raise this issue . 
as I previously mentioned , this form of intimidation is unprecedented . 
however in Erskine May , 21 st edition , page 115 states that an offence for contempt " may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence . 
on October 29 , 1980 , a Speaker of this House had this to say : 
- the dimension of contempt of parliament is such that the House will not be constrained in finding a breach of privilege of members , or of the House . 
this is precisely the reason that , while our privileges are defined , contempt of the House has no limits . 
let me provide this brief summary of the evidence in the documents that I have before me that confirms their efforts to intimidate me . 
i am prepared to read it all but would prefer just to provide it to you , Mr. Speaker . 
almost all the information contained in the plaintiff ' s statement of claim originated from CSIS . 
in fact the statement of claim contains a copy of my press release which bears the fax identification of the former solicitor general which was sent to CSIS . 
the plaintiff ' s affidavit of documents consists of 107 documents which included some of my press releases , as well as newspaper clippings , radio and television transcripts from media outlets across the country . 
every one of them came from CSIS , some of them before and some of them after the commencement of the lawsuit . 
the plaintiff also included four video tapes of media reports , all of which were recorded by CSIS and forwarded to the plaintiff . 
in a discovery of the plaintiff conducted on February 17 , 1998 , the plaintiff admitted in regard to the video tapes that " they were provided to me without my asking '' . 
both the plaintiff and his lawyer admitted during the proceedings that CSIS assisted the plaintiff in the preparation of his lawsuit . 
in a letter dated July 20 , 1998 , from the plaintiff ' s lawyer to my lawyer the following passage is included : " certain members of CSIS have co - operated with the plaintiff in preparation of his case '' . 
at a discovery of the plaintiff at the federal court on November 3 , 1998 , the plaintiff acknowledged that part of the reason he had contacted a senior manager at CSIS was to discuss the means by which he would proceed with his lawsuit . 
as well , at that same discovery the lawyer for the plaintiff admitted that " the legal counsel for CSIS had spoken with me from time to time , and I am sure with the plaintiff from time to time , trying to give us advice '' . 
thus it is clear from these comments that CSIS played a role in the preparation and conduct of the lawsuit against me . 
what is of particular concern is the fact that throughout the discoveries it was confirmed that it was Mr. Tom Bradley who played the key role in providing all this information to the plaintiff . 
this is of concern because Tom Bradley is , or was until recently , a senior member of the CSIS secretariat . 
on the CSIS organizational chart the secretariat answers directly to the director of CSIS and among their duties was liaison between CSIS and the solicitor general ' s office . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
this is a question of privilege . 
it does affect all of us . 
i invite members , if they have other meetings , to please carry them on in the lobby . 
i am sure that I as well as many others want to hear what the member is saying . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , the CSIS Act clearly limits what information CSIS can collect , generally restricting it to information that may on reasonable grounds be suspected of constituting threats to the security of Canada . 
i would suggest that the CSIS collection of all this information was improper . 
as limiting as the laws are restricting the ability of CSIS to collect information , they are equally restrictive with regard to the ability of the service to disclose any information collected . 
section 19 of the CSIS Act severely restricts the information it may disclose and nowhere in this section does it permit the disclosure of information to a private individual to assist his lawsuit against a member of parliament . 
in addition to the CSIS Act , section 3 . ( 7 ) of the human resources policy manual states that employees must not support or oppose any person , organization or product by using information obtained through their employment by the service except when authorized by the director . 
it is quite clear that the disclosure of this information to the plaintiff was in violation of the service ' s own policy . 
unfortunately CSIS was not satisfied with the role in assisting with the preparation of the lawsuit against me . 
immediately following the court ' s granting of the aforementioned order , counsel for CSIS filed a certificate of objection signed by Jim Corcoran , CSIS deputy director of operations , with Madam Justice MacLeod pursuant to sections 37 and 38 of the Canada Evidence Act . 
in that certificate Mr. Corcoran claimed that disclosure of the information requested in 32 of the 38 questions which were ordered to be answered would be " injurious to the national security of Canada '' . 
the remaining six questions were considered personal . 
in July , I was forced to challenge the validity of that certificate through a notice of application filed in the federal court . 
on October 5 , Mr. Justice Teitelbaum ruled that CSIS must make Denofsky available for cross - examination and costs were awarded against CSIS . 
my lawyer filed a notice of motion requiring CSIS to produce Mr. Denofsky for further cross - examination , requiring him to answer the questions he had previously refused . 
the day before the federal court hearing on January 14 , almost 11 weeks after Mr. Denofsky ' s cross - examination , CSIS provided responses to 39 of the 51 questions they previously had refused to answer . 
on January 15 , 1999 , the hearing before Mr. Teitelbaum took place and Mr. Justice Teitelbaum ruled on March 5 . 
he ordered CSIS to answer an additional three questions , which meant out of the original 51 questions that CSIS had refused to answer only nine of them , less than 20 % , were deemed to be valid objections . 
once again costs were awarded against CSIS . 
it is clear from the behaviour of CSIS that its main objective was to drag out the proceedings and deny me the opportunity of having this case heard in court . 
however the delaying tactics of CSIS were only part of the process . 
the content of its responses was even more troubling , which I have included in the documentation . 
in answering a question about the information the service passed to the plaintiff they neglected to mention the 107 press releases . 
CSIS also stated that it had passed the video tapes to the plaintiff in response to a request from him . 
however , as I have mentioned before , the plaintiff in discovery said that they were provided to him without his asking . 
in addition it mentioned that only one CSIS policy document was passed to the plaintiff . 
yet the very affidavit that this discovery was about lists five different CSIS policy documents . 
in other words , of the three points that CSIS made in this answer all three of them were incorrect . 
i cannot imagine , after making inquiries , that any member of a professional intelligence agency would be so incompetent that they could possibly inadvertently overlook all of this information , including the very affidavit that was being reviewed . 
the last piece of evidence that I will mention concerns the very certificate of objection that CSIS filed . 
when CSIS filed the certificate on July 7 , 1998 , the deputy director of operations , Jim Corcoran , certified that he had carefully reviewed and considered all the questions set out in that statement . 
he then certified that " the information sought by this motion , either by confirmation or denial of the said information , would be contrary to the public interest as it would be injurious to the national security of Canada '' . 
one such question was where the plaintiff refused to state during discovery whether or not it was normal that a full scale security investigation be done for people getting their security clearance renewed . 
despite the claim of CSIS that the answer to this question would be injurious to the national security of Canada , I have obtained the answer to this question from the Treasury Board ' s public website , listed under personal security standards . 
in conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I believe that I have provided you with sufficient evidence to find that there is a prima facie case of contempt against the Canadian Security Intelligence Service . 
as an opposition critic who has previously been critical of CSIS , its role in this case has effectively prevented me from raising concerns about it for three and a half years . 
in addition , CSIS has sent me and all members of the House a clear message that it is keeping track of us , watching what we do and listening to everything we say , and that it is prepared to pounce if it objects to the way in which we conduct ourselves . 
it has also shown that it is prepared to misuse the extraordinary authority that parliament has given to it to put us in an unwinnable situation . 
the premier of Quebec launched an inquiry when officials in his government improperly released information about a federal member of parliament . 
while not raised in a question of privilege it was considered wrong and an inquiry was ordered . 
the National Assembly of Quebec chose to take action against this activity , and this parliament should do the same in the case concerning CSIS . 
in my case CSIS conducted certain activities and utilized significant resources against me . 
the evidence shows that CSIS certainly took a role in orchestrating the lawsuit against me . 
as I have shown , CSIS improperly collected information and then subsequently disclosed that information to a third party in clear violation of CSIS policy . 
finally , I have shown that CSIS has misused its extraordinary authority to protect national security , that it was twice sanctioned by the federal court for misconduct , and that it deliberately misled the court to frustrate my ability to resolve the lawsuit . 
one of the basic tenets of democracy is that opposition politicians have the ability to oppose the government without fear of intimidation . 
i suggest that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has tried to introduce intimidation into Canadian politics . 
i believe it is vital that this form of intimidation is stopped immediately . 
opposition critics need to know that they can fulfil their function of criticizing a government department without fear that the department will retaliate by orchestrating a lawsuit against them . 
i therefore encourage you , Mr. Speaker , to make a precedent in this case by finding the behaviour of CSIS in this case in contempt of the House . 
i will provide the document I have here to support this claim . 
if you find that there is a prima facie case of privilege , I will move that this issue be sent to the appropriate committee for consideration . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank you for entertaining what I think is a very important question of privilege . 
what I think it comes down to is this , and it is a very important thing . 
there are a couple of important things to remember about this question of privilege . 
first , as has already been detailed by the hon. member , the question of contempt is an open - ended one . 
i can think of another very troubling case that was settled some time ago involving former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney over the airbus incident . 
i do not want to cast any idea of who is right or wrong , but what was interesting was that the government eventually had to settle for over $ 2 million to pay for the legal bills that Mr. Mulroney , because he is a wealthy man , was able to put forward in his own defence . 
how many members of parliament could have ever done that ? 
if he had been an ordinary member of parliament without those kind of deep pockets , I think Mr. Mulroney would be hanging on the ropes today instead of free and clear of that issue because he was able to fund that defence . 
that is why I think it is important that a government agency versus an ordinary member of parliament is an unequal fight and a contempt of parliament and we should see it that way . 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the solicitor general critic for the official opposition , I draw to your attention a meeting of our standing committee on May 25 with Director Alcock of CSIS . 
Mr. Speaker , if you have an opportunity to review the committee report of that session , you will find that the director exhibited the kind of culture and characteristics that have been spoken about by my colleague . 
as my colleague has pointed out , it is very important that parliamentarians are free from any sense of intimidation , in particular in the case of the meeting on May 25 . 
it was so troubling to all members of parliament , government members and all opposition members , that we subsequently held a second meeting to find out what our remedies would be in trying to get instruction to a very reluctant witness . 
in this particular case it was Director Alcock who just basically refused to respect the questions from the people in the Chamber . 
i draw that to your attention , Mr. Speaker , because I think it adds something to the picture that we are looking at here . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened with attention to the initial presentation made by the hon. member and the subsequent statements that were made . 
i do not know what they do to the seriousness of this issue . 
i am prepared to acknowledge that the accusations themselves are obviously quite serious . 
it has been alleged that CSIS offered assistance to a former employee in a civil case involving a member of parliament . 
it is alleged that this action then constitutes a question of privilege or possibly contempt or both . 
if I understood what the hon. member requested , it is that this case should be brought to the attention of a parliamentary committee for review . 
given the seriousness of these accusations , I want to remove the other materials stated by other members of parliament . 
i do not think some of them had anything to do with this issue . 
i would ask Mr. Speaker for a stay on the ruling he intends to give , whether this constitutes a prima facie case of privilege . 
i would ask that I be given a little time , and possibly other members might want to contribute toward what has been alleged today . 
in a few short hours we will have a Hansard or at least a fast version of Hansard giving us the details of what the hon. member has said . 
if I understand correctly , she has offered to table some documents with Mr. Speaker . 
if some of us could perhaps have those documents made available to us we could further contribute before Mr. Speaker makes his initial determination as to whether this constitutes a prima facie case of privilege . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
Mr. Speaker , I am prepared to table this information . 
the Speaker : 
these allegations are indeed serious if the allegations are true and if I decide that we will go ahead with a prima facie case . 
i want it understood that it is not just for opposition members for whom we are talking . 
we are talking about the rights of Canadian parliamentarians specifically . 
i of course invite the hon. member to submit to me any and all documents . 
seeing that there are no more interventions at this time , I intend to review everything that has been said and everything that has been written about this particular point and I am going to give this latitude . 
i am not going to stand here on splitting a hair . 
it may be privilege or it may be contempt . 
i will decide that after I have it all laid out in front of me . 
the hon. government House leader has asked that I stay my decision . 
i have said that I would do that . 
i would entertain information if it pertains directly to what was said by the hon. member here in the House or what is in the documents which she is going to provide to me . 
i will take this information under consideration now and I will get back to the House with a decision on this case . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
at the time that the debate was interrupted the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra had five minutes remaining for questions and comments . 
there were two minutes left in the presentation and then five minutes questions and comments . 
would the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra like to proceed directly to questions and comments or take the two minutes to sum up ? 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I had essentially completed my remarks which were on the knowledge century in the new millennium , the 21 st century professorships . 
i had also made some brief remarks on several other matters . 
i think we could take questions at this stage if there are any questions from hon. members . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
if we do not do that , we are not going to get the opportunity to have as many members participate . 
if there is only one member standing then we will have much more latitude for the question , comment or response . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with my colleague for Brandon - Souris and I will be splitting it equally . 
there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed . 
a lot of people were waiting for this wonderful vision for the millennium and thought that was exactly what they were going to get . 
they thought that they would see things that would turn things around throughout Canada , from the east coast to the west coast . 
a lot of people were very disappointed after the throne speech came out . 
we know that the good book says , " where there is no vision the people perish '' . 
that has been the situation in Canada under the government because so many people are hurting . 
i heard one MP say that she was so pleased with the throne speech that she was going to dance in the streets . 
i have not found anyone else that wants to be her partner while she is dancing . 
she is going to dance all by herself . 
the lack of vision was truly sad . 
the one good thing that came out of the throne speech was the infrastructure program . 
having been a mayor , and many of us in the House of Commons were mayors before , I know how we fought for that infrastructure program . 
the government is saying it is going to continue the program . 
i have talked to the people from FCM and they are very pleased about that . 
i am also pleased about that . 
however , we should have been back here September 1 , not the middle of October . 
let us look at what is happening with our airline service . 
we are not sure where it is going . 
in my city of Saint John , New Brunswick , we are not sure what is going to happen . 
if we do not have airline service then what happens to the economy ? 
what happens to the people ? 
let us take a look at the other issues , the immigration issue and the illegal immigrants coming into Canada . 
no one has dealt with that very serious situation . 
let us take a look at the fishery . 
i asked those questions today in the House . 
the fisheries is a serious situation and violence can and will occur unless the Prime Minister of Canada himself steps in . 
the Prime Minister has to go to the table . 
i had aboriginal people in my office at nine o ' clock this morning . 
these are not people that live on the reserves , but the minister of fisheries has refused to meet with them . 
he and the Prime Minister have to meet and talk with them . 
i want to make sure there is a strong foundation for my two little grandchildren . 
i feel very strongly about families . 
i feel very strongly that we have to help them . 
we have to make sure that there is a strong foundation to continue to build on and assist the family unit . 
it is very important that we reduce personal income tax . 
we should be putting money back into the pockets of those parents . 
it is also very important that the transfer payments be increased so that we can have health care back where it should be . 
one would not believe the horror stories in my riding office that have happened through health care . 
we have lost in our part of Canada many of our specialists . 
we just lost another one . 
it is a major concern . 
we have to reduce our massive national debt . 
when I took over as mayor the city was in a very poor financial position , just like the country is in a very poor financial position , and I wanted to get us into a borrowing debt free position . 
i asked the commissioner of finance to give me three programs to look at to try to get us into a borrowing debt free position . 
when he put those programs before me it just so happened that on my council I had a professor at the time . 
that professor said to me " Elsie , come here to the window '' . 
i went to the window and I looked . 
we do not want to slash , burn and cut to the point that he has no way to feed his family '' . 
we did it in a very responsible way . 
this has to happen again at the federal level . 
of those men who were here on a hunger strike , one of them has been in the hospital for two operations since he went back . 
it is truly sad when we take a look at how the Liberals have cut the defence budget to the point that our troops that have to go to Croatia , Kosovo and East Timor do not have the equipment they should have . 
they must have been hurt . 
they are no longer there and the seniors are having a difficult time . 
the government needs to raise the basic income tax exemption to $ 10,000 . 
this could eliminate a lot of people from the tax rolls , more than two million lower income workers . 
the solutions rest in the strengthening of the family unit with lower taxes , with better co - operation among Ottawa , the provinces , the territories and our communities . 
we have to look at the quality of life . 
since the government came into power in 1993 it has increased personal income taxes by 15 % . 
in five years it did that . 
in five years a lot of middle income Canadians are worse off today than they have ever been . 
i know that myself . 
my daughter - in - law said to me " Mom , I find it hard these days to make ends meet '' . 
i said " I know , dear , because you are paying more in taxes than ever before '' . 
i have to say right now that things have to change , that things have to turn around . 
however , there had better be a better vision than what was contained in that throne speech if we want to turn Canada around . 
if we want to do what is right for families , if we want to do what is right for all Canadians from coast to coast , there is a lot more that needs to be done . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened closely to the member for Saint John and I think she gave a fine speech . 
i also see that she has the same health problems in her riding as we have in Quebec . 
the present federal government , led by the Liberals , has always given us to understand that only Quebec had problems with its health system , because of its sovereignist government . 
its sidekick in Quebec , the Liberal Party , has said the same thing . 
i am therefore happy to note that the member for Saint John has the same problems in her region . 
but , given the Canada - wide problems the member pointed out , I would like to know what this government , which has helped itself to provincial transfer payments , should have done right away in the throne speech , instead of promising action for 2001 or 2002 . 
i would like the member for Saint John to tell us what she would have liked to see in the throne speech that would have solved health problems in Canada . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne : 
Mr. Speaker , I would have liked to have seen money injected immediately into our health care , our educational system and transfer payments for both , along with social programs , and not in the year 2001 . 
that is two years down the road . 
we are suffering now and steps have to be taken now to correct it . 
we have to push the government to make sure that it puts that money in there before the year 2001 . 
Mr. Ren é Canuel ( Matap é dia - Matane , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have also listened to my colleague . 
she said that there was absolutely nothing for seniors . 
i say that this is scandalous , when we are in the International Year of Older Persons . 
there are other equally honourable people who cannot get on TV and they are forgotten . 
why are only a few people shown on television while others without a cent to their name are forgotten ? 
there are many seniors living in almost dire straits . 
i will let the hon. member respond to that shortly . 
reference is made to youth and children . 
in 1988 , the House of Commons voted unanimously for there to be no more poor children by the year 2000 . 
there were a million of them at that time , and today there are 1.5 million . 
that is shocking . 
a policy has been announced . 
i am not saying it is not helpful , but it is not applicable until the year 2001 . 
i am asking what the hon. member for Saint John thinks of this . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne : 
it also put carpenters , electricians and cabinetmakers to work . 
it created a good economy for us , but there is nothing for these people now . 
i have 1,000 families in Saint John , New Brunswick , that are in need of housing and there is no program at all . 
they do not want to tell me that the year 2001 is good . 
it has to be done now . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is always difficult to follow the member for Saint John . 
i will try my best to liven it up , but as I said it is somewhat difficult to match that enthusiasm . 
i am very pleased to be able to respond to the Speech from the Throne as presented by the new governor general . 
we all congratulate and welcome Adrienne Clarkson to her new post as governor general . 
i am pleased to stand in this august House to represent my constituents of Brandon - Souris . 
i certainly thank them for giving me the opportunity to represent them . 
i assure them that I will do my best to represent them to the best of my capacity . 
i will certainly pass on their concerns to the government . 
as one of the members of the government said , the throne speech was not supposed to have any substance to it but was supposed to show the vision of the government going into 21 st century . 
by the way , the government succeeded in not having any substance in that speech , but it did not succeed very well in showing the vision of the government going into the 21 st century . 
my colleague from Saint John talked about a specific area that was neglected in the throne speech , that of housing . 
i will touch on a couple of others . 
the Liberals succeeded in putting forward a very warm and fuzzy Speech from the Throne . 
that is very good and very positive . 
they touched on health care but they talked about the research requirements in health care . 
they did not really talk about where health care would be going in the next 10 , 15 or 20 years , or about what Canadians would like to see as their health care system unfolds into the 21 st century . 
this is not something that we can say is status quo . 
we have to look to the future . 
they talked about children and youth , a very important aspect of our society . 
the children we bring into this world and this country are obviously a resource and we have to look after them . 
unfortunately they did not go far enough with respect to children and youth in our society . 
the problem with Canadians today in listening to the throne speech is that they have a tendency not to believe governments any longer , in particular this government . 
the government has a history of perhaps saying things Canadians would like to hear but of perhaps not implementing them in the way Canadians feel they should be implemented . 
i do not have to go very far . 
i have to look at the scrapping of the GST which did not come to fruition . 
they were going to rip up the agreement , which is one of the major reasons the budget is now balanced . 
it is the reason the Liberal government can now take credit for something that was put into place by a government that had vision , that could look 10 and 15 years down the road and say that what is right for Canadians now is a free trade agreement so that we are a partner in the globalized trading world of today . 
if it were a Liberal government that had to put that into place , we would still be hewers of wood and drawers of water . 
the Liberals have not fulfilled any of their promises . 
Canadians today will be somewhat skeptical when they look at the throne speech that was presented two days ago . 
the Liberals talk about taxes that will be reduced . 
Canadians do not believe them because right now taxes are taking a larger portion of their pay packets than what they did previous to 1993 . 
the Liberals talked about health care and they talked about the research components of health care . 
we are going backward , not forward . 
the Liberals hold it up as being a centrepiece of their platform . 
the fact is they do not know where they are heading with health care and Canadians are concerned about that . 
i think Canadians wanted to have a good feeling as to where this government wanted to head in the future with respect to the retirement of our debt . 
our debt did not come to us immediately . 
as a matter of fact it came to us over a number of years inclusive of the Liberal government and Mr. Trudeau and inclusive of other governments . 
but there was none of that . 
what was in the throne speech was that yes , they will deal with it if they possibly can . 
that is not a plan . 
the throne speech did not talk about an area that is very close and dear to my heart and my constituency of Brandon - Souris , which by the way I think reflects society in general , an urban rural area . 
we have people who are rich and poor . 
we have people who are young and old . 
agriculture is the backbone of this country and always has been . 
i am frustrated and disappointed . 
we did not have to come up with the solutions . 
what we needed was the vision . 
a government member said " we do not deal with substance , we deal with vision '' . 
where are we going with agriculture ? 
there is no support . 
we are not supported against the Europeans and the Americans right now . 
all the government had to say is that philosophically agriculture is a very important component to this society , that it believes in a very strong , domestic supply of food for our country . 
that is all the government had to say . 
it had to say that the environment is very important and agriculture is an important part of the environment . 
it had to say that with the endangered species legislation the government talked about , it is important that we deal with agriculture and producers to make sure the endangered species legislation works . 
the government never said that . 
it never tied into it . 
that is vision and that is what is lacking in the throne speech . 
that is where we had to head with vision and that is what I did not see . 
we talk about the seniors . 
what about vision with respect to the baby boomers that are now among the seniors ? 
why do we not talk about retirement in 2010 or 2020 ? 
that is vision . 
this is a reactive government , not a proactive government . 
there was none of that . 
what was there ? 
there is no vision . 
that was lacking in the throne speech . 
a pet peeve and a soap box I like to get on is the world of work . 
work is changing all around us . 
there is contract work . 
people are now doing work in their own homes . 
there are people who are part time employees , whether they want to be or not . 
that is the vision . 
the Liberals have to put a plan in place to accommodate those people in 2000 , 2010 and 2020 . 
i am disappointed . 
what we got were warm fuzzies with no substance . 
yes , that is what the Liberals attempted to do and that is what they achieved . 
first , we do not believe the Liberals will do anything that they said they would do . 
second , it did not go far enough . 
if this is the vision of this government , if this is the direction in which this government wants to take us after January 1 , 2000 , then I am very concerned . 
our citizens are concerned . 
for the government not to have said a word about it is absolutely disgusting . 
Canadians from coast to coast needed some assurances and confidence . 
they got nothing in the throne speech and I am very concerned about our direction in the next century . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened carefully to the speech by the hon. member for Brandon - Souris . 
i would have liked him to have said what he thinks about the measure on parental leave . 
the government tells us that we need to help young families to have children , but then it organizes things in such a way that parental leave will only take effect in the year 2001 , and takes the money from the employment insurance fund . 
i would like to hear the hon. member address this point . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
Mr. Speaker , I left the parental leave to my colleague from Saint John and I thought she handled it very well . 
i have two children . 
i believe very strongly that children should have access to their parents during their formative years , particularly between one and three years of age . 
i am very proud of the way we had our children grow up and develop . 
at that time we did not have many supports from the federal government . 
if those supports are available , we will encourage it absolutely . 
we have to make sure that our children are taken care of because that is the resource we are going to depend on over the next number of years . 
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member has a vested interest in the agricultural industry and the family farm crisis being experienced throughout Canada , especially in the prairie provinces . 
he is very close to the industry in the Brandon area . 
what does the hon. member think about the concentrated control of our food and drug industry in North America and the world ? 
a handful of multinationals control the food input and output costs of the farmers and the farmers are vulnerable . 
the farmers want to be as independent as they can be , but they are at the whim of the multinationals with commodity prices , input prices , herbicides , drugs , pesticides and seed costs . 
the Liberal government seems to be very proud of this biotech division , but the farmers are being led through an evolutionary change on the family farm . 
i would like to hear the hon. member ' s comments about that . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik : 
i go back to my comments about having an understanding as to where we want to go in agriculture . 
do we want Canadians to have a reliable domestic food supply ? 
i think that if we asked Canadians , they would say yes . 
Canadians would say yes to an affordable food supply . 
we have to talk about the multifunctionality of agriculture with respect to the environment . 
i think Canadians would say it is an important factor . 
do we want to have an independence in that sector and that industry ? 
i think Canadians would say yes . 
those are the questions the government did not ask . 
if Canadians say yes to all of those , then we have to put a philosophy together that says we will make sure that agriculture is going to exist in our country in the next 20 years and that it is going to be in family farms , as the hon. member has said . 
we have to be flexible enough to recognize that there is an evolution in agriculture , but we have to make sure that there is still an independent ownership of that agriculture , of the people who live in our communities and who want to continue to grow crops in those communities . 
we have to protect them against some of the issues the hon. member just mentioned . 
we have to protect them against some of this intrusion into their flexibility and independence . 
Mr. George Proud ( Hillsborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Guelph - Wellington . 
it is an honour for me to speak today to show my confidence in the government and the programs set out in the Governor General ' s Speech from the Throne . 
i would like to offer my humble thanks to Her Excellency Madam Clarkson for the gracious speech which she addressed to both Houses of Parliament and to all Canadians . 
there is much to talk about the millennium and what the next century holds . 
after hearing the Speech from the Throne I am certain we will enjoy a fruitful millennium , one which the Canada we know today will continue on its course of greatness in the next century and beyond , the Canada we know which looks after all citizens and creates a positive environment allowing them to maximize their potential as individuals and as collectivities . 
i could go on for days describing the wonderful state in which we live , but I am here today to show my support for our government and its plans for the coming years , its plan that will lay the foundations for generations inhabiting this great land . 
i see the Speech from the Throne as a symbol of the incredible progress we have made over the last six years . 
it is by far one of the most promising and well thought out programs I have had the pleasure to be part of . 
i would like to commend the government on its foresight . 
we are honoured to be part of a plan that takes into consideration not only the needs of middle class Canadians , but also recognizes those Canadians who may be in a less fortunate position . 
we see before us a government that is ready to commit to children and youth , to rebuilding communities , strengthening the environment , increasing disposable income through tax relief and improving our place in the world . 
we should be proud of our commitment to Canada and proud we are . 
i am also greatly pleased that so much of what our program entails is going to directly benefit my home province of Prince Edward Island . 
children are going to enter the millennium with a better education , better standard of living and a better future than has ever been seen in our history as a nation . 
new parents are going to have an edge over my generation . 
mothers and fathers alike will be able to raise a family without having to worry about the future . 
i remember a time not so long ago when the thought of raising a family in the 21 st century concerned a lot of people . 
it concerned us because under the last government we were headed toward a society where families would have been ignored . 
today we can look forward with hope . 
we can be hopeful because we are taking steps to invest in the future . 
children are the future of our nation . 
without them our liberal democratic tradition will not continue . 
they represent our legacy . 
this government will help parents spend more time caring for young children while ensuring that they have the resources to meet their children ' s needs . 
our plan will do this by reducing income taxes for families , extending employment insurance parental leave benefits and adding an additional $ 1.7 billion a year to the national child benefit making it easier for low income families to break the cycle of poverty . 
we must also invest in today ' s youth . 
they are acquiring knowledge and skills at an earlier age . 
they are at home in the wired world using tools that are rapidly changing the way we think . 
we are experiencing a technological revolution . 
when I was younger we used to use our two feet to look for a job . 
now our young adults can use the Internet to look for employment . 
they can also shop , trade stocks , say hello to a relative , all with the flick of a mouse . 
it has changed the way in which we work . 
these youth need to be given the tools to succeed under these conditions . 
our plan will give Canadian youth an edge as the technological revolution continues so that we will surpass all other nations in the world when dealing with technology ' s challenges . 
our plan will help Canada ' s youth realize their potential as leaders . 
the government will help them learn about their country and its citizens , use their skills to help others and use their creativity to contribute to Canada ' s culture . 
this will be achieved by drawing on the expertise of young Canadians to help connect rural and urban communities to the information highway by hiring our youth to put in place additional Internet access sites for public use . 
this will increase the participation of rural Canadians on the Internet while giving our youth valuable work experience . 
we will also give 100,000 young Canadians every year a chance to learn about another part of the country through exchanges Canada . 
this will solidify our youth as knowledgeable Canadians while increasing their awareness of regional issues . 
clearly technology investment is a thoughtful investment for the future of a strong Canadian federation and a strong Canadian youth . 
but all of this investment in youth , in family and children which I just spoke about is worthless if we do not have safe strong communities , communities that are free of crime , and a strong voluntary sector to tie them together . 
strong communities rely on the participation of all members . 
our government is committed to strengthen this partnership with communities and the voluntary organizations which contribute to them . 
if I may take this a step further , our investment in communities is part and parcel of our long term economic and social well - being . 
our investment in children and families is also a long term investment . 
we are however at a loss if we do not include the environment in our long term goal to enter the millennium with force . 
a clean and healthy environment is central to our quality of life and as time progresses the demands that are made on mother nature will become even more severe . 
the government recognizes this and will continue to build partnerships at home and abroad which focus on sustainable development and improve the quality of the environment in our communities . 
we will set and enforce tough pollution standards , reduce greenhouse gases , clean up contaminated sites on federal lands and support innovative clean - up technologies . 
canada has always symbolized a nation that appreciates the environment . 
as we enter the 21 st century we will continue this tradition of environmental preservation by extending Canada ' s national parks system . 
the financial stability of Canadians is also very important as we enter a new century . 
financial freedom allows Canadians to maximize their potential , gives them the freedom to grow and to put something back into the country . 
having said this , I cannot stress how important it is that we receive tax relief . 
this is the best way to give our economy a kickstart and to give the children of the future a solid foundation on which to grow . 
we cannot just provide children with a positive learning environment ; we must also give them the financial support in which to flourish . 
to give our families more disposable income so they can provide their children with the foundation to grow will certainly make Canada the place to be in the 21 st century . 
over 80 % of the responses I have received so far demand that the tax burden be reduced . 
it is clear that we must give Canadians an incentive to build . 
i look forward to our government ' s response to the overwhelming demand that exists for tax relief . 
in the Speech from the Throne Her Excellency the Governor General addressed tax relief issues . 
our government will put more dollars in the hands of families with children . 
our government will also continue to create a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden , initiating more tax cuts and making strategic investments . 
the economic spinoff from a tax cut will add to the economy . 
people who have more money at their disposal will stimulate the demand for goods and in turn will create more jobs . 
it is a win - win situation . 
i would like to join the millions of Canadians who have embraced our program . 
may we enjoy its benefits and grow as a nation as we enter the 21 st century . 
the Speech from the Throne is an ingenious formula for success . 
it contains measures that will strengthen elements of society so that as we enter the millennium we will be the best country in the world . 
let me explain this . 
our families need a dynamic economy in which to raise their children . 
we are giving them this through tax relief . 
our children need strong , safe communities in which to learn successfully . 
our government is giving them this . 
to learn successfully children need a strong health care system and our government is giving them this . 
each of these realms promotes individual development . 
our plan promotes the maximization of individuals ' potential , young and old . 
once we achieve success in every realm of individual maximization our quality of life as Canadians will improve and in turn our place in the world will improve . 
it is quite clear that we are responding positively to the daunting task of preparing Canada for the new millennium ; and yes , we are prepared . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what is amazing with this government is that it has a lot of money . 
what is even more amazing , however , is that it does not have money for this year or for the year 2000 . 
this government is suffering from the wait and see disease . 
we have to wait . 
and what about people who are waiting for the government to do something ? 
i ask my colleague opposite if he could make representations within the Liberal caucus to get the government to bring forward the implementation dates with regard to both parental leave and the infrastructure program . 
this is another ambiguous issue . 
the government says that studies will be conducted between now and the end of the year 2000 and that maybe , in the 2001 budget , it will be able to respond to the request made by municipalities . 
i ask my colleague opposite to be clearer and more precise than the Prime Minister of Canada was yesterday . 
Mr. George Proud : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for the question . 
the government has laid out a plan for the future and the next budget in February will lay out the details on the tax cuts and other issues that have been raised . 
he asked me if I would intervene . 
i am always intervening on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of all Canadians to make sure that the government does things as quickly as it can , but there are rules it has to go by and it is going by those rules . 
however , I am sure , as I have read in the headlines of the papers over the past few days , that the people in Canada are very pleased with the throne speech . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have always had a lot of respect for the hon. member for Hillsborough . 
i know he is here for the right reasons , to do the right things on behalf of his constituents . 
however , I have to admit that his speech was fairly wishy - washy , if I can use that term and it can be translated properly . 
it gives the impression of warm and fuzzy . 
i wonder if he saw the headlines about transportation , which was not mentioned in his speech , with respect to a potential monopoly situation in the air . 
i wonder if he saw the headlines with respect to the fisheries , where people are actually committing violence against one another . 
is that the type of Canada that he sees , or does he not see that through his rose coloured glasses ? 
does he not believe that it is the responsibility of his government to try to come up with solutions to those issues ? 
Mr. George Proud : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his questions . 
yes , I have seen those headlines . 
i happen to live in an area where some of those problems are taking place . 
i have confidence that the government , as it has always done , will take care of those problems . 
the member heard in question period today the question on agriculture . 
that has been taken care of . 
the question of the native and non - native fishery is a very volatile problem and I hope that cooler heads will prevail and that the government , the native fishermen and the non - native fishermen can get together to work out a solution . 
i said that we live in a great country and that things are great . 
things have never been so good , but there are still a lot of people suffering . 
that is why the government has come forward with programs to help these people , with tax cuts , with child tax benefits and with all of the things that will happen over the next couple of years . 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in today ' s debate . 
it is an important one . 
this week ' s Speech from the Throne was great news for my riding of Guelph - Wellington , and for all of Canada , quite frankly . 
it outlined a commitment to protect and improve the social programs we all hold very dear while not abandoning our commitment to fiscal responsibility . 
they said no , that the Conservatives were not on the right track . 
we refused to let this era of deficit spending continue . 
by 1998 , just five short years later , we had not only balanced the budget , we had posted a surplus of $ 3.5 billion . 
that is an improvement of $ 45.5 billion . 
it is an accomplishment of which every one of us can be proud because each Canadian helped to do that . 
obviously our balanced plan is working and we will continue to pursue that plan because it is working . 
the Speech from the Throne renews our commitment to fiscal restraint . 
we have renewed our commitment to ensuring that the nation ' s finances never get out of control again . 
we have renewed our commitment to ensuring that the debt to GDP ratio remains on a downward track . 
we have renewed our commitment to continue cutting taxes while making strategic investments in this country ' s future . 
the Speech from the Throne contains a promise to further reduce taxes . 
people in my own riding as well as many Canadians across Canada have asked for that . 
we will put more money back into the pockets of all Canadians . 
the next budget will also lay out a multi - year plan for tax reduction . 
targeted tax cuts and broad based tax cuts are both priorities in my riding . 
i have done a survey in Guelph - Wellington and that is what my constituents have told me . 
however , I also want to stress that Guelph - Wellington believes , and I know many Canadians across our great country agree , that we must not cut taxes at the expense of our valued social programs . 
that would be a serious mistake . 
when asked where new spending should be directed , my constituents identified post - secondary education as a priority . 
i am pleased to report that our government is committed to ensuring that Canada has a strong infrastructure to improve our skills , promote innovation and conduct research . 
that is great news for the University of Guelph . 
the University of Guelph is a world class , world renowned institution located in the heart of the golden technology triangle . 
it is an important part of the academic community and of our local community . 
consequently , we are all very pleased with the federal government ' s promise to increase support for granting councils , enabling them to forge new partnerships with universities and to attract more of the best research minds in the world . 
this will be done through an innovative program called 21 st century chairs for research excellence . 
we will invest $ 60 million in the first year , $ 120 million in the second year , $ 180 million in the third year . 
the program will be ongoing , with the goal of creating 12,000 positions in three years and 2,000 in the very near future . 
it is fantastic . 
the federal government also will foster greater international research collaboration by Canadian universities , and research institutes will help to expand Canadian scientific expertise in a variety of areas . 
the federal government will also work with our provincial partners to develop an action plan that sets out common principles , objectives and a funding framework for all governments to increase their resources dedicated to post - secondary education . 
together we will find ways to ensure that skills development keeps pace with the evolving economy and makes it easier to finance lifelong learning . 
for anybody who has worked in a community , we all know that lifelong learning is absolutely paramount in this economy . 
it is very important . 
the survey that I did also indicated that health care is very important and on people ' s minds . 
people want access to quality universal health care , and the factor really is a very high quality of life . 
people want that . 
our health care system represents our society ' s belief in compassion and in caring . 
many times we hear the Reform Party talk about the United States and how wonderful the United States is . 
over the next two years we will support our partners in testing innovations in home care and pharmacare and integrated service delivery , then consider what further significant investments need to be made . 
we will also build a modern health system to make health information more accessible , not only to health professionals but also to citizens like you , Mr. Speaker , and I. 
more and more we are learning that the quality of our health is affected by the state of our environment . 
Canadians have long recognized that a clean and healthy environment is essential to maintaining and enhancing our quality of life . 
Guelph - Wellington is known for its environmentally friendly practices , such as its state of the art wet and dry recycling facility . 
just recently we had five members of parliament in attendance at an event held at the recycling plant . 
this was really a great show of support from the government for recycling and environmental issues . 
i believe other communities can and will learn from our example , especially given the federal government ' s commitment to further developing and adopting green technology . 
a clean and healthy environment is a wonderful legacy for our children . 
children are our future and Guelph - Wellington believes that they deserve the best possible start in life . 
on this issue once again the Speech from the Throne reflects the priorities of my constituents . 
the 1999 throne speech includes the commitment to help families by cutting taxes and leaving more money in their pockets . 
the federal government will also increase funding for the national child benefit by 2002 , further helping parents to provide for their children . 
we will lengthen employment insurance benefits for parental leave . 
children always come first with the government . 
in a recent survey my people identified health care , post - secondary education , tax cuts , the environment and the future of our children . 
the throne speech has all of these elements . 
the Prime Minister of Canada has listened to the people of Guelph - Wellington again . 
the throne speech lays out our path as we enter a new century and a new millennium . 
the initiatives it outlines will help us to maintain a dynamic economy , strengthen our communities and further advance Canada ' s place in the world . 
i know that the future holds many wonderful things for Canada . 
with the guidance of the federal government , we will work together and achieve our goals . 
the world has seen the future and it is Canada '' . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
since the government took office , the environment has gone from the sixth largest department to the twenty - first largest department in government . 
this is also a government that waited six years to pass its first environmental piece of legislation since taking office , the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , Bill C - 32 , which was not exactly a watershed bill . 
as the House knows , the environmental members of the Liberal caucus , those very learned members in terms of the members for Lac - Saint - Louis and York North , all expressed concerns on that piece of legislation . 
my question is very simple . 
does the hon. member think one piece of legislation passed in six years is a watershed leadership on environmental legislation ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
many communities have studied our recycling wet - dry facility and many areas are following our example . 
the federal government has just put a huge amount of money into that so that all communities can learn . 
the government has been doing this consistently . 
it has been going across Canada and putting money into projects that really do work and really make a difference in all of our lives on a daily basis . 
in the end this will benefit all of us and will leave a legacy for our children that we can all be proud of . 
Mr. Ren é Canuel ( Matap é dia - Matane , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member would have us believe that there are no problems in Canada or almost none . 
he keeps repeating that like a parrot . 
it is not necessarily true . 
how is it that the government is offering so little , and nothing before the year 2001 ? 
between now and then , what is it offering children ? 
what is it offering the many teenagers across Canada who take their own lives because there are problems ? 
we must not bury our heads in the sand . 
the truth must be told . 
there are a lot of problems in Canada but the government prefers not to see them , because that is less painful . 
what will be done between now and the year 2001 since most programs will kick in only after 2001 ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member from Quebec said that we need to spell out the truth . 
he is indeed quite right . 
we do need to spell out the truth . 
we have a party across the way , the Bloc Quebecois , that wants to break this beautiful country up . 
it is disgraceful because the reality is that we do live in the best country in the world . 
we have been named six times as the best country in the world . 
as President Clinton said when he was here , I do not know of any country where people can get along better by being on their own and breaking a country up . 
when Quebec needed help who helped it ? 
every province from across Canada helped Quebec and it was happy to take that help . 
the Bloc members should be ashamed of themselves . 
do they want to hear the truth ? 
they should be proud Canadians and proud to live in this great land of ours . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wanted to rebut the $ 42 billion but I will pass on that . 
the member for Guelph - Wellington mentioned that she had five Liberal MPs in her riding recently . 
why could she not bring her colleagues down to see that in her rosy little world ? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
Mr. Speaker , I will invite my colleagues to go to my hon. colleague ' s riding . 
i know there are serious problems in Canada , but there is no question that we live in the greatest country in the world , bar none . 
the reality is that the Liberal government will continue on a path of trying very hard to make sure social problems are addressed and that we are financially and fiscally responsible . 
we pledge to that . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
the reason I want to address that issue again is that the intentions of my suggestion have been repeatedly misinterpreted not only by the government but also by opposition members on this side of the House , both Conservative and NDP . 
it is sad that has happened because the reality is that if we do not go back to the court , if we continue on the path that the minister has taken , the minister will be sitting at the table with no cards in his hands and no chips on the table . 
the fact is that the decision by the court has taken away the minister ' s bargaining position . 
he has nothing to negotiate . 
the court has very clearly allowed a native preference and a native priority to fish as a result of this Marshall decision . 
the court has very clearly stated that . 
it has also not imposed any limits on it . 
the court has again said that natives have the right to fish and earn a moderate living . 
the minister has in fact made matters worse by suggesting that he will allow that right and recognize it as a communal right . 
the reality is then that rather than a fisher going out and earning a moderate living from that fishery , it could very well be expected that moderate living could apply to all the Mi ' kmaq in the maritimes , all 12,000 and some - odd of them . 
if one out of four of those Mi ' kmaq decides to exercise the right that the court has granted , there will be no room at all for anyone else in that fishery . 
that is the pure , hard , cold facts of the matter . 
the disappointment I had with the debate last night was that nobody seemed to be speaking for the current participants in this fishery . 
nobody in the House was addressing a concern about those people . 
an hon. member : 
you did . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
my colleague says I did . 
yes , I did , but it seemed that I was a voice in the wilderness in this place . 
it is going to take more than just saying so . 
it is going to take convincing the minister to go back to the court to seek a stay of judgment . 
the reason for that is quite simple . 
if he goes back and seeks that stay of judgment , it is going to give him some bargaining chips . 
he will have something on the table in front of him that will allow him to negotiate from a position of strength . 
as it is now , he has nothing . 
the courts have given the proverbial ranch away . 
the question is : how outrageous is this request to seek a stay of judgment ? 
is it somehow trying to avoid the decision ? 
is it somehow trying to work around the decision and avoid it ? 
no , it is not . 
the stay of judgment is asking the court to back off to allow for a cooling off period . 
it is asking the court to define its intentions with regard to , for example , a moderate livelihood , and to define or clarify whether non - status natives are going to be covered by this decision . 
this would give some guidelines for the minister to take to the negotiating table . 
this would allow the minister to bargain from a position of knowledge . 
if no effort is made to define the rights of non - status natives , if there is no effort made to define whether or not the courts were including them as people to be covered by this treaty , it is best to know that now because as sure as the Lord made little green apples that matter will end up in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
if it is not done now at the request of the minister , it will be done two or three years from now . It will be there . 
we could have two or three years of negotiation with the Mi ' kmaq people to try to find a place for non - aboriginal fishermen in the newly mandated fishery , and after two or three years of debate find all of that tossed out the window because all of a sudden we have about another some 36,000 non - status natives at the table as well saying that they too have a priority right to fish as a result of this treaty . 
it is critical that a decision is made to go back to the court . 
that decision has to be made within the next three days , because the government had 30 days from the time the decision came down to ask for a stay of proceedings and for this redefinition . 
if the government allows that time to go by without making application , it has lost it . 
there is nothing on the table . 
the minister has given it up . 
he has walked away . 
he has turned his back on fishermen in the maritimes . 
it is as simple as that . 
why my request would be denied by the NDP and by the Conservatives is beyond me . 
why they would deny strengthening the minister ' s hand so he could clarify the situation that is before us , so he could determine the level of participation of non - aboriginal fishermen in this fishery , is beyond me . 
why would they deny guaranteeing non - aboriginal fishermen access to this fishery ? 
as I said , there is no guarantee now that there will be room for non - aboriginal fishermen if this decision goes unchallenged . 
clearly the Mi ' kmaq could use up the total access that we now have to the resource . 
there is no question at all that they have a priority right to that fish and could very well utilize the total allowable catch we now have . 
i would like to apply that consideration to the decision the supreme court reached in the Marshall case . 
that information should be presented to the court when we ask for this stay , because I do not think it was the intention of the court to create this separate but equal fishery . 
if we look at the Gladstone decision of the Supreme Court of Canada , that decision gave the Heiltsuk band of the central coast of British Columbia the right to fish herring roe on kelp . 
it said they had an inherent right to fish herring roe on kelp , but at the same time it acknowledged that others had also acquired rights . 
if the government went back to the court it would acknowledge that others have rights . 
i would advise the government to seek that balance and perhaps some give some guidance on how that balance could be achieved . 
unless the government seeks the stay , I do not think we will have the benefit of that advice from the courts . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the remarks of the member because I too am deeply troubled by the supreme court decision in the Marshall case . 
i do not agree with him however that we should seek a stay and go back to the courts for interpretation . 
i suggest to the hon. member that the courts have already done enough damage with their decisions . 
to leave it to the courts to determine what a moderate livelihood is would be like a game of Russian roulette . 
i am afraid parliament and both sides of the dispute will be the ones who will suffer from it . 
i address my remark to the member . 
my own feeling is that surely the better way to approach this problem is for parliament , through its elected government and through the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , to put his own interpretation on moderate livelihood and apply that interpretation . 
that court decision is so vague . 
as somebody who has spent my life in words , I find that the judges have actually put words into a treaty that did not exist and used that as a basis for an interpretation . 
it really reduces this place to insignificance when courts can apply judgments to laws that we have not created , as they have done in this case with the British treaty of 1760 . 
i ask the member , if it were a choice , is it not better for the government to act swiftly and unilaterally and do its own interpretation ? 
Mr. John Cummins : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments of the member opposite . 
yes , it would be beneficial if the government could act unilaterally and fix this problem . 
unfortunately it cannot . 
the supreme court has stated what the law of the land is , and the law of the land gives the Mi ' kmaq a priority right to commercial fish . 
the only right the minister has to interfere is the right to interfere in the interest of conservation . 
that is the only way he can interfere in this matter . 
the court looked at the current regulations in place and struck them down . 
it said that those regulations interfered with the treaty right and therefore they had no place . 
what is interesting is that we arrived at this situation not unwittingly . 
the information that we present to the court enables the court to make decisions . 
it will make a decision in our favour against it , if we want to look at in those terms , but if we do not give the court the information we are at its mercy . 
not only must we give them the information , but we have to be careful if we make any concessions . 
the government made two critical concessions when it argued this case before the supreme court . 
in the first one the crown ' s expert witness described the prohibition on Mi ' kmaq trading with others and the restriction that they only trade at truck houses . 
the crown ' s expert witness allowed that that could be interpreted by the courts as somehow a right to trade . 
it was anything but a right to trade . 
it was a restriction on a trading right , but the crown allowed that restriction on a trading right could be interpreted as a right to trade . 
the second mistake the crown made was that this treaty did not mention fish as a trading item . 
fish had no value as a trading item and was readily available to anybody . 
yet the crown allowed and the government allowed that fish could be included as a trading commodity . 
from a restriction on trading , from a treaty in which fish was not mentioned at all , we arrived at a place where preferential right to fish has been given . 
we have a very difficult situation . 
it is easy to criticize the supreme court and I have done it because it deserves to give this situation the sober second thought that it did not get by the government . 
there are other issues the government did not mention that are worth mentioning . 
since the signing of the Magna Carta in British common law there has existed something called the public right to fish . 
that public right to fish was in operation at the time this treaty was signed . 
this treaty ignored that public right . 
that should have been brought to the attention of the government because there was nothing done when this treaty was signed to revoke the public right . 
the government should have brought that to the court ' s attention . 
it did not and that has been allowed to stand since that time . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak in response to the throne speech on the issue of immigration . 
immigration issues were some of the issues that were in the forefront . 
certainly they were issues that were most important to Canadians over this past summer . 
there was not even a broad statement in the throne speech on what the government intends to do with immigration . 
twenty per cent of Canadians see immigration as the most important issue to them , up from 3 % in the last poll that Angus Reid did . 
i believe the reason for this is that Canadians have recognized the government ' s bungling in terms of dealing with the issue of illegal migrants over this past summer , in particular illegal migrants coming by boat , although certainly at the airports and borders as well . 
only 5 % to 10 % of all people who come illegally to our country come by boat . 
the rest come through the airports or across the borders . 
Canadians have finally recognized that our government losing control over people coming into the county is a real threat to national security . 
it is a true threat to national security . 
i believe this issue has moved up to occupy second place when it comes to issues of importance to Canadians . 
if we look at cities like Vancouver and Toronto , immigration right now is by far the most important issue to people in those cities . 
it is an issue which the government completely ignored despite having 41 of 43 seats in the greater Toronto area and having seats in the Vancouver area . 
i think it is really shameful neglect . 
our immigration system today is dysfunctional , not only in terms of dealing with people coming into the country illegally but also in terms of dealing with those that we want to attract through our immigration system the people who are designated as people Canada wants to attract by the immigration department . 
our system is completely dysfunctional when it comes to those people we want to attract and that is what I intend to talk about today . 
i want to start with the government ' s handling of the whole issue of illegal migration over the summer . 
with this summer ' s arrival of illegal migrants by boat , about 600 , which represents only 5 % to 10 % of illegal migration , what was the government ' s response ? 
after prodding from the official opposition and from Canadians across the country the minister said " I am going to expedite the system . 
i am going to make it so that the people coming by boat illegally will have a hearing within six to seven months rather than the eleven month average we have now '' . 
that is only the initial hearing . 
it has nothing to do with appeals . 
we have seen appeals lasting for years and years . 
it is not that uncommon any more . 
the government ' s response was to expedite the process . 
that process has been expedited so much that as of last week out of the roughly 600 people who came by boat only 4 have gone through the process . 
i am talking about just the initial hearing . 
we have had no appeals so far . 
what is the significance of this system taking so long ? 
the significance is certainly high to Canadians generally , and to those who have had their lives put into limbo through this process that is so dreadfully slow . 
we have people who have come to this country believing in many cases that they are coming to establish a new life . 
certainly they know that they are using illegal means to get here in most cases , but they do not understand that they will be led into a life of servitude , that they will be a part of a virtual slave trade , the new slave trade . 
for this to be happening is shameful . 
we will look back in history 30 or 40 years from now and wonder how Canada could have been so negligent in handling this situation . 
the people who have come will have their lives put on hold for months and years , and then many will be deported back to their countries of origin . 
what will be left for them two or three years down the road ? 
i would suggest very little . 
in the meantime , what about Canadian taxpayers ? 
they are footing the bill for this system that is not functioning well at all . 
they are paying millions and millions of dollars because the process is so slow and so flawed . 
it is shameful . 
by ignoring this in the throne speech the government has demonstrated that it is just not willing to deal with tough issues such as this . 
i think we need a government that will show some leadership . 
what we proposed over the summer , and in fact over the past six years , is that first we should detain all people coming to this country until their hearings , but that the hearings be held within days or weeks rather than months or years as is now commonly the case . 
then , once a determination has been made , it should be acted upon . 
that is what we have called for . 
yesterday in the House the minister said that Canada has some of the toughest laws on this issue . 
i do not know what she was comparing us with , because in fact we have extremely weak laws in terms of dealing with people smugglers when compared with the United States , Australia or other countries . 
not only that , the maximum 10 year sentence has never been implemented . 
the maximum sentence that has ever been imposed on someone involved in people smuggling in this country is somewhere around three years . 
that is completely unacceptable and it clearly demonstrates a lack of leadership by this government . 
i would like to speak next about this system not working for the people for whom it is intended to work . 
there are three streams of immigration . 
the first stream is the independent category , which is made up of people who come because they have special education or special skills , or because they are going to invest in a business or operate a business . 
the second stream is the refugee stream . 
most experts would suggest that through our refugee stream probably 60 % are bogus refugees . 
they are not legitimate refugees as laid out in the UN convention on refugees . 
the third stream is family reunification of both of these previous groups . 
i would ask if any member of the House could honestly say that they do not have a huge problem in their constituency when it comes to processing people whom we desperately need in this country , those people who bring a special skill or education , or reuniting them with their families from their countries of origin , or reuniting a Canadian with someone they have recently married . 
i know that not one member of the House would say honestly that the system is not so badly broken that it is not working for these very people for whom it is intended to work . 
not only is the system not working for those it is intended to work for , it has been a disaster in terms of screening people for whom it is not intended to work . 
it should be clear to Canadians that we need leadership on this issue . 
we are not getting it from the government . 
i implore the government to deal with this issue . 
if it will not , and I assume it will not - it has shown no will to do that - then we will when we form the government in two years . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to reassure the member for Lakeland that there are those on this side of the House who share some of the views he has just expressed about the urgency of coming to grips with the problem of the migrants on the west coast . 
in my six years in the House I think I have only once heard a suggestion from the Reform Party that I fully agreed with and that was the suggestion that the migrants should be detained until their cases are disposed of and it is determined whether they are refugees or not . 
this seems like a harsh thing to do . 
we are actually keeping people confined , as they would be in any kind of detention , which is a type of jail . 
the alternative is too much to even contemplate . 
what we are really dealing with is trafficking in human beings . 
so long as these people are released back into the community - and I know the Department of Immigration has already experienced this - they are immediately drawn into absolute slavery . 
the condition of their passage is to work it off in one manner or another . 
in that sense I think the hon. member is entirely correct , even though the prospect of detaining people is very unpalatable to anyone who wants to give people the benefit of the doubt and freedom in the process thereof . 
i wonder if the member would comment on that . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit : 
Mr. Speaker , the member has hit on a key point . 
the Singh decision and other decisions have said that those who arrive at our borders or even in territorial waters are entitled to the full set of rights that a citizen would be entitled to . 
i believe that decision does have and impact on this situation . 
however , I believe that even with those restrictions in place , this government , if it had the will , could speed up the process to the point that it could process people coming illegally in days or weeks rather than months or years as is now the case . 
then detention is not such a big issue . 
people then are detained for days or weeks . 
if they choose to appeal it could be longer , but we could speed up the appeals process rather than detaining them for months or years . 
therefore we deal with both problems . 
we also deal with sending the message to those involved in people smuggling that if they want to make money smuggling people into Canada they are no longer going to be able to do it because , by gosh , Canada deals with these situations quickly , firmly and we act on the hearings while still respecting the UN convention on refugees . 
i believe we can respect the UN convention on refugees fully . 
i believe we can get around the Singh decision , which I believe was a very bad decision , and the other decisions and speed up the process to the point that it will work quite well . 
let us give control over policy issues back to the government . 
the government could take it back . 
it would be rare that it would involve invoking the notwithstanding clause . 
it just takes the will on the part of government . 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a great pleasure to see you in the chair . 
the new session has started well with you gracing our presence . 
i am also happy to have the opportunity to take part in the debate on the Speech from the Throne , a speech which was read by our new Governor General , Her Excellency Madam Clarkson , on Tuesday . 
i join with all members of the House , and of course with yourself , Mr. Speaker , in congratulating her on her new role and in wishing her the very best in the years ahead as Her Majesty ' s representative in Canada . 
since I have also been given a new role in the federal cabinet , I am pleased to take part in this debate and to have the chance to talk about an issue that I have been connected with all my life , that of protecting the environment . 
as we heard in the throne speech , Canadians understand very well that the high quality of life we enjoy in this country , as well as our health and the health of future generations , depends on a clean and safe environment . 
Canadians also understand that the quality of our environment is closely linked to that of the world environment . 
they understand clearly that any progress in this area requires initiatives to be taken on both the national and the international level . 
the Liberal government intends to make environmental issues central to Canadian public life in coming weeks and months . 
to that end , we are going to take action on a number of different fronts , and to step up our environmental protection measures . 
as I am sure hon. members fully appreciate , the Government of Canada does not have jurisdiction over all environmental and species protection issues in this country . 
that is why we will be working in close , harmonious partnership with provincial governments , municipalities , first nations , the academic community , the business community , environmental groups and , of course , individual Canadians who are concerned . 
we no longer have the luxury of pretending that environmental questions amount to a zero sum game of jurisdictional tradeoffs , a game where a win for the environment is somehow a loss for business , or a win for business is a loss for the environment , or a win for the provinces is a loss for the federal government and so on . 
we must reinforce the fact that a clean environment , human health and a strong economy go hand in hand and that we must work together to achieve those common goals . 
therefore , I will be working closely with my provincial counterparts because in many areas we share responsibility for protecting the environment . 
i believe that provincial action can be influenced by the federal government even in situations beyond our strict constitutional jurisdiction . 
with respect to species protection , for example , there is a long history of co - operation among the federal , provincial and territorial governments through such things as the designation of protected areas , implementing international wildlife agreements and a commitment to biodiversity . 
in 1996 , some three years ago , wildlife ministers agreed to the accord for the protection of species at risk . 
i am pleased , in fact I am delighted , that all governments in this country have agreed that any species protection legislation must include provisions for the protection of the critical habitat of endangered species . 
this is absolutely fundamental : no habitat , no species . 
we are now working under that accord with our provincial colleagues to develop stewardship programs and other collaborative and voluntary measures to protect species at risk . 
one such program is the Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Foundation which is close to my home on Vancouver Island . 
environment Canada is working with the B.C. Ministry of the Environment , Lands and Parks , B.C. Hydro , MacMillan Bloedel , the forestry company , the World Wildlife Fund , the Toronto and Calgary zoos and many others to try to save one of this country ' s most endangered species from extinction . 
i believe the Vancouver Island marmot is North America ' s most endangered mammal . 
the federal legislation to protect species at risk mentioned in the Speech from the Throne will complement and strengthen provincial legislation with programs and voluntary initiatives . 
the federal approach aims to build on the excellent efforts to protect endangered species which are already being made and measures already being taken by so many individuals and groups . 
i salute them . 
the only sustainable way to preserve species and their habitats is to ensure that appropriate incentives and knowledge are available to encourage each Canadian to do the right and responsible thing . 
we expect this to work in the vast majority of cases but when it does not , prohibitions must be available to prevent extinction and critical habitat destruction . 
we are also working to protect our water resources . 
protecting Canada ' s fresh water is not a question of economics or trade ; it is a question of ecology . 
water is vital to human health , for our ecosystems , agriculture and industry . 
canada ' s sovereignty over its water resources is total . 
water in its natural state is not a commodity , and therefore not covered by NAFTA . 
in order to ensure an enforceable Canada wide solution using an ecosystem approach , we are working jointly on an agreement under the terms of which each jurisdictional area would establish laws , regulations or policies prohibiting the removal of large quantities of water from Canadian water basins , including for export . 
that includes federal legislative measures through amendments to the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act . 
they will be introduced this fall and will give the federal government the legislative authority to prohibit the removal of large quantities of water from bodies of boundaries water , such as the Great Lakes . 
we have also made a request with the United States to have the International Joint Commission study how water consumption removals and diversions could affect our Great Lakes . 
our objective here is not to plan for removal but to provide a basis for ensuring a consistent management regime for water shared with the United States . 
Mr. Speaker , I know that your riding is at the end of the Great Lakes and the beginning of the St. Lawrence River . 
i am pleased to report to you that the interim report of the commission which was released in August supports our strategy and agrees that removals are harmful to the ecosystems that they support . 
the report recommends an immediate moratorium on bulk water removals until the full report is completed , which we expect to be early next year . 
the commission is consulting widely with Great Lakes communities through public meetings which are currently under way . 
Canadians are especially concerned about air quality . 
residents in many areas are subjected to unacceptable air pollution caused by ground level ozone and airborne particles which combine with other air pollutants to produce smog . 
that is particularly so in our urban centres . 
we have taken several measures to reduce smog over the last few years but I have to say a great deal remains to be done . 
for example , measures are now being taken to reduce the level of sulphur in gasoline . 
we want to reduce those levels by 90 % by 2005 . 
why ? 
because the health benefits alone will be of enormous benefit to Canadians . 
an independent panel of health and environmental experts predicts that a reduction to that level would prevent some 2,100 premature deaths , 92,000 incidents of bronchitis in children , five million other health related incidents such as asthma attacks , and eleven million acute respiratory symptoms , such as severe coughs and new cases of pneumonia and croup . 
that would be over a 20 year period . 
with those figures I wonder whether anyone could argue that those steps should not be taken to protect the health of Canadians . 
i do not think many would . 
it also gives me satisfaction to be able to note that the government is determined to work with provincial governments and other levels of government to improve the country ' s physical infrastructure in the coming century . 
we must ensure that our increased trade and our improved economy are matched by an increased capacity to move people and things in complete safety . 
in order to maintain the quality of life in our cities and rural communities , we must ensure our air and water are clean . 
this agreement will set out shared principles , objectives and fiscal parameters for all partners to increase their resources directed toward infrastructure , with a particular focus on the environment , as well as health and safety , transportation , tourism , telecommunications and culture . 
i would like to describe this program that we will be developing as a green infrastructure program because I am sure that when we examine the needs of this country that in fact is the way it will be . 
i would like to say a word about contaminated sites . 
we will be dealing with the clean - up of contaminated sites and how we can improve our performance in that area . 
that again was mentioned in Her Excellency ' s speech . 
i must warn Canadians that this will be a long term program . 
we have had , as reported by the environment commissioner , starts and stops before . 
i want to see a clear outline , a program , to achieve substantial clean - up of our contaminated sites over the next 20 years . 
recently we have committed some $ 38 million to the clean - up of the Sydney tar ponds which is Canada ' s most contaminated site . 
of course more will be required on the financial side and more will have to be done . 
there are literally thousands of contaminated sites which are under federal jurisdiction , thousands more under provincial jurisdiction and many which we describe as orphan sites where there is an abandoned mine and there is no possibility of finding an organization which will pick up the clean - up costs . 
the tar ponds remind us of why we must change our approach to the environment . 
we need to prevent pollution before it occurs rather than paying the enormous costs which sometimes result from clean - up after the fact . 
that is why we must be more diligent in conducting our environmental assessments . 
it is why we have made pollution prevention the cornerstone of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , or CEPA . 
the renewed CEPA provides the government with stronger powers to protect the environment and therefore human health . 
essentially it marks a shift from after the fact clean - up to proactive prevention . 
after investing a very lengthy period of more than five years in renewing this legislation , I believe we can now move forward on implementing stronger environmental protection to give Canadians the cleaner environment that they deserve . 
i announced two or three weeks ago that $ 72 million would be put forward in new funding to strengthen our scientific and enforcement capacity under the new CEPA . 
this is in addition to the $ 40 million that was announced earlier this year to conduct scientific research into toxic substances that harm human health and the environment , including endocrine disrupters , the so - called gender benders and toxics that may have serious effects on all species , including the human species . 
under the act , all substances currently used in Canada will be examined for their level of toxicity . 
as well , the act provides firm deadlines for the control of toxic products and requires the virtual elimination of the most dangerous ones . 
the act gives Environment Canada officials significant new powers to act with respect to a polluter breaking the law . 
it will also help Canada honour a number of international environmental commitments and enable people to initiate proceedings if the federal government does not ensure compliance with the law . 
the act includes new provisions for regulating vehicles and fuels and new abilities to regulate less traditional sources of air pollution such as lawn mowers and off - road vehicles . 
the government has already begun discussions with manufacturers of these devices so as to reduce toxic emissions and greenhouse gases . 
we are committed to clean air . 
we are prepared to take the action necessary to prevent the build - up of greenhouse gases that are responsible in part for climate change . 
this may eventually mean some changes in lifestyle choices for many Canadians , but I am confident that Canadians understand there will be even greater adverse lifestyle changes if we do not take action at the present time on this problem . 
on climate change , in 1997 Canada joined with 160 other nations in negotiating the Kyoto protocol on climate change . 
we set a target of reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to 6 % below the 1990 levels . 
the fact that other countries have agreed to comparable reduction targets does not make the 6 % reduction any less ambitious or challenging for an energy dependent country such as Canada . 
to meet these targets , given the projected growth in our economy and population , we will have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 25 % below the business as usual projected levels for 2010 . 
those targets cannot be reached without significant changes to the way our economy functions and to our lives as individuals . 
the most credible evidence that we have available tells us that climate change due to human activity is a reality . 
i could give more on climate change . 
i have many pages in my speech explaining the problem and giving examples of it . 
i will simply say that I will be happy to discuss this with the member over lunch some time . 
i am sure the member agrees it is important to make sure we have a system that is acceptable to Canadians which achieves the goals in question . 
many opportunities will be provided by our environmental programs such as developing new environmental technologies . 
the opportunities for export , et cetera , are there . 
therefore we have many provisions which again could be mentioned , but I will pass over them quickly and simply say that we will find economic opportunities which will flow from our efforts to improve the environment in Canada . 
in conclusion , Canadians understand the linkages between the environment and health and between environment and economic growth . 
they understand that we need to have development and growth . 
that has to be sustainable in the future . 
they also understand that we must act decisively or in essence we will be guilty of robbing our children and grandchildren of a safe , secure and prosperous future . 
i am sure all members of the House will actively support our actions in this regard . 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this minister and his B.C. Liberal sidekicks have shown very little regard for the problems and rights of the vast majority of B.C. citizens . 
first , there is the expropriation of the provincial land at Nanoose Bay in the face of incredible opposition , something never done before in Canadian history . 
second , there is the lack of protection of B.C. ' s children by their appalling inaction on the court ' s decision on child pornography . 
third , and I address this to the former minister of fisheries , over a period of time they have failed to effectively solve the problem of the preservation of the salmon stocks on the west coast and have downsized the fleet so that hundreds of fishermen and their families are bankrupt . 
fourth , there has been inaction on closing the loopholes on Canada ' s immigration laws that saw hundreds of illegal immigrants come to the shores of Vancouver Island this summer . 
fifth , there is a total lack of compassion for non - native residents on Musqueam lands who will soon be kicked out of there homes . 
i can go on and on , but I think that is enough . 
why should the people of B.C. have any confidence in the Liberal promises made in the throne speech when they have that appalling record before them ? 
hon. David Anderson : 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the hon. member that in poll after poll the Liberal Party in British Columbia receives double the support of his party . 
if these issues are so important to the people of British Columbia as he has described them , he should recognize the people of British Columbia recognized that the balanced approach of the government to improve expenditures on health care and on the social side , the reduction in taxes and in debt , is the appropriate way for Canada to go , and that this is very beneficial to British Columbia . 
were he correct , his party might perhaps have more support than it currently does . 
he is a member of a party whose own leader thinks the party should disintegrate and disappear . 
poll after poll in the last many months have shown our support to be double that of Reform . 
clearly he is continuing to put the Reform Party ahead of the interests of British Columbia . 
that is why he and his friends are so consistently rejected by the people of British Columbia . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened very closely to the new Minister of the Environment . 
for his part , the minister says he is going to consult so as not to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction . 
the minister also tells us he is going to take action immediately . 
right now , Canada is flying in the face of everything other countries are doing . 
it wants to put more energy into getting nuclear power plants to burn plutonium . 
i would like to know where the Minister of the Environment stands on this , and if all Canadians and parliamentarians will have a say before Canada makes a decision on this issue . 
hon. David Anderson : 
Mr. Speaker , first I thank the hon. member for Jonqui è re for her questions . 
her first question was about co - operation between the federal and provincial governments . 
i can assure the hon. member that I have already had meetings with provincial ministers . 
we have had very productive discussions on endangered species . 
we all shared the same views , as I mentioned in my speech . 
we set the objectives three years ago . 
the purpose of the meetings held a few weeks ago was to discuss ways to achieve the goals that we set together . 
there is truly a great deal of co - operation between the various levels of government , because we know that Canadians want us to take action . 
the second thing that she mentioned was the issue of the very small amount of weapons grade plutonium , the MOx which is to be burned in the Chalk River reactor . 
the reason this is important is that the world has literally tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that are rusting in former soviet union territories and need to be disposed of , to be eliminated . 
we have to take risks . 
it is true that she is correct . 
there can be very minor risks related to transportation , but if we are not willing to take the small risk to achieve a much greater gain for society our children and grandchildren will know that we have failed because we simply are delaying a problem to them . 
this is a very important issue . 
it is truly an example of the biblical injunction to beat the swords into ploughshares , to destroy weapons for good . 
can we think of anything more symbolic of turning evil into good than turning these weapons of mass destruction into light and power for human use ? 
is there anything more symbolic of the type of thing we should be doing ? 
yes , I admit to the member that there are risks , but I challenge her to think also of the risks of doing nothing . 
the worst thing we can commit as legislators is to simply say there is a problem and do nothing , leave it alone , ignore it , let our children have the problem and inherit something much worse than if we dealt with it now . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
i know he referred to this in his speech but perhaps he could clarify it . 
just what is the government ' s intention with respect to how it plans to live up to the motion passed in the House in February this year having to do with the government placing an immediate moratorium on the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers and , according to the motion , introducing legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater exports and interbasin transfers ? 
the motion that was passed called for a national ban on the bulk export of water . 
i asked the government House leader today under House business whether there was legislation forthcoming . 
he said as far as he knew there was . 
i would like to ask the minister if he could clarify just what we can expect in this regard by way of national legislation , a national ban , because as he knows the provinces , particularly Newfoundland of late - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt . 
the hon. the minister will have about a minute to respond . 
hon. David Anderson : 
Mr. Speaker , once again I thank the hon. member for an excellent question . 
i will go a lot further than he proposes . 
we will be having a meeting of provincial ministers and myself , because as I mentioned to the hon. member for Jonqui è re we believe in the importance of co - operation in this regard and many aspects of control of water are provincial . 
we will move together with them through the accord . 
as the hon. member has correctly mentioned , in the last few days Newfoundland has come on board of the accord concept for the elimination of exports . 
we are delighted with that . 
in addition , I am going further by discussing with them not just the elimination of exports of bulk water . 
i should distinguish between bulk water exports and containers of water , which are a different matter . 
in addition , we do not believe there should be any major diversions from watershed to watershed whether or not they cross international boundaries . 
we will be discussing with the provinces an accord which essentially lives up to the International Joint Commission report of the Great Lakes area but in addition deals with the issue of interbasin transfers for water beyond just exports . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
it is seldom that we are able to have some time to question a minister regarding some of these issues . 
as incompetent as some of them are , I am sure that all of us would agree to another 10 minutes of questioning of the minister with agreement from the House . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. the member for Wild Rose has requested the unanimous consent of the House to extend the period provided for questions and comments by 10 minutes . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a good thing that we have an opportunity to discuss the throne speech delivered earlier this week and entitled " Building a higher quality of life for all Canadians '' . 
when I look at that title , certain questions come to mind . 
of course , since I take a particular interest in the agri - food sector , I must tell you that I have the distinct feeling that agriculture was completely left out in this speech . 
one would need a magnifying glass or would have to be an expert at criscross puzzles to find something that applies directly to agriculture . 
these difficulties are also caused by a drop in prices , which are unstable or low for agricultural commodities , both animal and vegetable , as well as by natural disasters . 
this brings me to the issue of the crisis Canadian agriculture is facing today . 
one just has to look at the numerous releases that were sent to us over the last year to understand what I am talking about . 
we saw all kinds of changes being made to the program , all kinds of adjustments to try to make it acceptable to farmers . 
but I wonder if government officials sat down with a farm family to see how these people can fill out these kinds of forms . 
some of the farmers who spoke to me of their distress told me that filling out the form can cost them $ 1,000 or so in accountants ' fees , because an accountant is needed . 
the farm ' s taxation year is not the year in which the products are sold . 
there are therefore two kinds of figures and generally a person who is very busy and used to doing farm work is not going to be an accountant as well . 
there is one delay after another . 
why so ? 
people do not enrol in this program because the forms are too hard to fill out and the results are very questionable . 
yet when this program was implemented , there was a national revenue advisory committee , which asked that there to be no payment ceilings for farmers , that asked for use of negative margins , and for no linking to NISA , the Net Income Stabilization Account . 
all that was forgotten . 
yet the people consulted knew their business and could have been of great service to the agricultural sector . 
so here we are facing a crisis that is far more acute in the west than it is in the rest of the country , and which is reflected accurately in the letters children write to the Prime Minister or the Minister of Agriculture . 
these children write that : 
" they need more than one job to survive on the farm '' . 
basically , they are complaining that their mother and father have to hold down two or three jobs in order to make ends meet until the end of the month , if not the end of the day or week . 
another child , Terryl Drisdale , wrote : 
" farmers are a unique type of people . 
i am very sure that you personally don ' t work the hours annually that the farmers do for the pay that they have at year end '' . 
it is moving , because these are sixth grade children writing the Prime Minister or the Minister of Agriculture . 
it is like a cry of dismay at that point in social terms . 
how will they cope with this crisis ? 
not with what they currently have at their disposal . 
suppliers waiting to be paid for 1998 commodities have been very patient again in 1999 . Will they continue to be ? 
when things are not going well in one sector of society , the wolf is at the door . 
so too there are people waiting to buy dirt cheap the land that is often family heritage and has been cleared and maintained by dint of hard work . 
yet , the government believes in rural life and in the diversification of farms , but all these fine principles the government states in public do not come about in a single day . 
there is also income security . 
but here we realize that the program changes every three or four years . 
how can events be followed over the long term if the programs change ? 
there were references in the throne speech to research and development . 
it mentioned increased funding for research and development . 
and it is high time , because nothing has changed since 1993 , despite the efforts in the last budget . 
what is important , and needs to be mentioned , is the need for those doing basic research to be independent . 
the programs now in place often involve partnerships . 
sometimes not much is said about the partner , but when its involvement runs to 90 % , as it does with certain large corporations , the large corporation picks the research topics and they do not include basic research to help the public . 
all these partnerships inhibit research . 
there is also the issue of genetically engineered organisms , one in which I have a great interest . 
yesterday , we heard the Prime Minister begin his speech by stating that the next century will be the century of the Pacific . 
but , if we do not resolve firmly to label genetically engineered products , we will not get very far selling to the Pacific . 
are we prepared to lose Asian markets ? 
this is a very good question which must be asked and which has a major impact on the country ' s farmers . 
i would like to conclude - I could go on at great length about genetically engineered organisms , but I will address the matter at another time - by referring members to page 19 of the throne speech , which reads as follows : 
the Government will protect the health of Canadians by strengthening Canada ' s food safety program , by taking further action on environmental health issues , [ - ] pesticides [ - ] 
this sounds like the bill that died when Parliament was prorogued , but it is reminiscent of the premises of Bill C - 80 , a superstructure with no accountability , where failures in the health system make us fear the worst . 
we cannot add all this to the work of Health Canada when we already know that the brain drain has left it unable to evaluate all the services the government should provide . 
so I have some major concerns . 
despite its lofty title , the throne speech leaves me , as agriculture critic , very puzzled . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
we are faced with a rather pathetic if not immoral situation in Canada . 
there are also individuals who are getting poorer because of the very heavy tax burden . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie : 
Mr. Speaker , that question is virtually a whole program itself . 
there is something interesting in what my colleague has said : each province that has capitulated to the federal government is experiencing delays with the transfer of assets . 
expand this situation and their jurisdiction has been totally lost just to get what they need . 
we have seen how this happened with social affairs . 
everything was turned over to the feds to solve the problem . 
now there is a heavy price to pay . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak in the debate on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
this partisan document once again follows along the main thrusts of the September 1997 throne speech . 
there is continuity here : it is a document continuing centralization and non - respect of Quebec ' s jurisdiction . 
the Prime Minister and his so - called strategists have taken each of the themes of 1997 , changed their titles and added paragraphs . 
a fine makeover , with the maple leaf in the background . 
the editorial of Le Devoir of October 13 provides in this regard : " It would be good news for once to hear that the federal government wanted to honour the principle underlying all federal regimes , which is the sharing of jobs and jurisdictions and proposed to its partners that the provinces come up with a consensus on joint policy . 
new real desire remains to be proven , however , especially since the speech includes a number of projects that could rapidly become irritants '' . 
this centralizing recipe now includes a social union sauce , which could well further spoil relations between Ottawa and Quebec City . 
i smile at the thought of Liberal ministers and members talking partnerships , agreements with their partners . 
how could we be expected to believe such a philosophy when the government itself cannot respect jurisdictions and is continually encroaching on their jurisdiction ? 
examples include the case of the national plan on skills and learning for the 21 st century , future health research institutes and the five year infrastructure program . 
on this issue , the federal government has made a commitment , but we will have to wait until the end of the year 2000 , not the end of the current year . 
yet , during the prebudget consultations , all the municipalities of the electoral district of Lotbini è re asked me to urge the federal government to take immediate action . 
another vague promise , with no specific funding , and we will have to wait for the 2001 budget to know the specific commitments of the federal government . 
i have made a diagnosis of this government . 
it makes a promise now , but only for 12 , 15 or 24 months from now . In the meantime , those who need the money suffer . 
let us now go back to employment insurance . 
considering that 60 % of the unemployed currently do not qualify for benefits , what do we find in the throne speech to give some hope to these people ? 
not much . 
yet , when the federal government talks about fighting poverty , it should give priority to the employment insurance program , which is one of the causes of poverty and one of the main reasons why people are leaving the regions of Quebec . 
what have the Liberals done to help regional development ? 
they have come up with minor partisan measures and they made a big deal about some small subsidies , as they did last month when they sent a delegation of five federal ministers headed by the new minister of patronage , assisted by the new secretary of state for professional sport - I mean amateur sport , but given his recent statements , I am more and more convinced that his job is geared primarily to helping professional sports . 
but let us go back to unemployment and regional employment insurance rates . 
this is an absurd situation which jeopardizes the very foundation of the employment insurance program . 
in my riding of Lotbini è re , the regional rate set for the regional county municipality of Lotbini è re is very detrimental to the people there , compared to the riding ' s other RCMs . 
having two regional rates create two classes of unemployed in the riding . 
people constantly contact my offices to condemn this social injustice . 
the Corporation de d é fense des droits sociaux de Lotbini è re , social and economic stakeholders and the unemployed will mobilize in early November to convince the new Minister of Human Resources Development to correct the mistakes made by her predecessor . 
once again , I would like to explain this administrative nightmare . 
the rate , which is determined arbitrarily by Statistics Canada and considered to be realistic , means that one must work 630 hours to be eligible for benefits for a period ranging from 17 to 40 weeks . 
in the other RCMs in my riding , the regional rate is 11.2 % and the number of hours required is 490 to be eligible for benefits for a period ranging from a minimum of 23 weeks to a maximum of 45 weeks . 
it is a gross injustice for the RCM of Lotbini è re , since the socio - economic profile is the same for the whole riding . 
therefore , setting a single employment insurance rate for the whole riding that is in line with our true socio - economic profile is of the utmost importance . 
businesses are also penalized by this regional rate , since they do not have access to the same federal subsidy programs as businesses from other areas in my riding . 
in the Speech from the Throne , the federal government expressed its intention to make the Internet accessible to everybody . 
first of all , a lot of parents cannot even afford to buy a computer . 
second , in our opinion , the CRTC should ensure that all Canadians have access to an individual telephone line so that they can connect with the Internet . 
right here at home on the eve of the third millennium , certain regions in Quebec and in the rest of the country still do not even have the basic services necessary to access the Internet . 
this government is completely cut off from the daily lives of people in our society . 
but it is in a big rush to get its hands on our money . 
the budget surpluses belong to all taxpayers , not just the Minister of Finance , who fiddles with the books and conceals the real state of the country ' s finances . 
the Minister of Finance already has the necessary leeway to announce immediate tax cuts for middle income taxpayers , those whose hard - earned money paid down the federal deficit , unemployed workers , youth , the sick and the poor . 
in short , my conclusion is very simple : the federal government has money to spend in fields of provincial jurisdiction , but not a cent when it comes to problems for which it is accountable . 
that is the Canadian way of the Liberal government as I see it . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member for Lotbini è re on his excellent speech . 
i think he is very close to his constituents . 
he has shown us that the Speech from the Throne truly has nothing to do with the real concerns of the people . 
the federal government has chosen to spend in sectors that are not its responsibility and not to make appropriate decisions in those that are , such as employment insurance . 
i would like the member for Lotbini è re to explain the whole question of the map used to determine how employment insurance will apply in a given area , a problem he mentioned in his speech , which is being experienced where he comes from especially . 
it is an important matter for the unemployed that are concerned , but it is also a problem throughout Canada , because in this case as in others , the federal government is refusing to revisit the current employment insurance legislation . 
all sorts of situations are getting worse , and I would like him to tell us more about those concerning the map that governs the rates of unemployment and that defines the number of weeks that people need in order to receive benefits . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as the regions are concerned , this is again an invention by this government , an invention for interference , differing regional rates , so as to penalize all of the unemployed . 
now that I am regional development critic , I must say that this is a situation that is greatly harmful to regional development . 
here is an example . 
i am in my office and someone comes in to tell me " I am 10 hours short of eligibility for employment insurance '' . 
so I explain the legislation to the person , who goes away . 
he then meets a neighbour who lives 20 kilometres from him , and that person is getting employment insurance . 
how is an MP who wants to be fair , and wants to see all his constituents treated justly , to explain such a crazy situation ? 
apart from that there is not a single public servant in my riding , which has a population of 70,000 . 
this is abnormal , and once again it is the outcome of the famous employment insurance reform , which penalizes everyone in Quebec . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not hear an emphasis with respect to tax reduction in terms of what this country clearly needs . 
this country needs broad based tax reduction . 
a number of speeches have been made in this House that have focused on the necessity to have broad based tax reduction . 
we have seen growth in those jurisdictions . 
we have seen it in Ireland . 
we have seen it in the province of Ontario . 
does the hon. member believe that the government ' s rhetoric in the throne speech with respect to tax reduction is just that , or is the government capable of providing tax reductions that Canadian families need so desperately ? 
Mr. Odina Desrochers : 
Mr. Speaker , my answer to the Progressive Conservative member is this : let him find one single line that is clear in the Speech from the Throne . 
it is a bunch of vague promises , with no real commitments . 
an hon. member : 
like abolishing the GST . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers : 
how do Canadians and Quebecers react to such a document ? 
the 1997 speech was just as vague in terms of commitments . 
two years later , nothing has changed . 
the plight of Quebec ' s unemployed is glaring . 
we are faced with a crisis in the fishery . 
the government is trying to pass legislation to intrude into provincial jurisdictions , and is using this document to try to make us believe that this is the Canadian way . 
this sure bodes well for the future . 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour as the member for Essex to speak to the throne speech which was so eloquently delivered by Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson whom I would like to congratulate on her appointment as Governor General . 
i know that she will bring respect , integrity and enthusiasm to her new position and will serve the Canadian people both gracefully and honourably . 
today I would like to reaffirm my thanks to the constituents of Essex for giving me the privilege and opportunity to represent them in the House of Commons over the past six years . 
as many members know , my riding of Essex is situated in southwestern Ontario , the southernmost part of Canada and consists of the newly amalgamated towns of Amherstburg , Essex , Kingsville , Lakeshore , LaSalle , part of the town of Tecumseh and all of Pelee Island . 
Windsor and Essex county has been the core of Canada ' s automotive sector and industry since 1925 . 
Daimler Chrysler Canada ' s operations are headquartered here , along with major facilities for both Ford and General Motors . 
since 1991 their combined investment has totalled over $ 6 billion . 
their presence has attracted over 500 manufacturers of auto related parts , supplying state of the art machinery , machine tools , moulds , stampings , dies and automation transfer equipment . 
with less than 2 % of Canada ' s population , our region is home to 20 % of all tool and die makers , 50 % of industrial mould manufacturers and 80 % of the automation transfer machine companies operating in Canada . 
our workforce is diversified , dependable and disciplined with old - fashioned work ethics . 
keeping our workforce in tune with technology is a top priority among our manufacturers and educational institutions . 
the University of Windsor has established itself as one of Canada ' s foremost research universities . 
in partnership with government and industry , it has initiated programs pioneering the development and deployment of advanced technologies . 
in addition , the Chrysler Canada University of Windsor Automotive Research and Development Centre , a joint venture , brings together the best business and educational minds to create both company driven and research oriented solutions . 
as well , St. Clair College of Applied Arts and Technology concentrates on management productivity , trends and skills development and manufacturing technologies in tool and die and mould making . 
we are responsive to the industry ' s needs where training is carried out on the factory floor where students gain access to the latest in technology . 
as chair of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry in the last session of parliament , and as the member for Essex with such a vibrant technology based community , I was pleased to hear the Governor General outline the steps that we will take to improve our infrastructure of skills innovation and research . 
at one of our hearings , the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada , the Canadian Association of University Teachers and the Canadian Consortium for Research , the Humanities and Social Sciences Federation of Canada , and the Canadian Graduate Council highlighted their focus together in the opening paragraph of their submission by stating : 
Canadians realize that innovation is vital . 
it is the foundation for our economic and social prosperity and our ability to compete in a global market . 
to be successful , we need a steady stream of new ideas , a well - educated workforce for the knowledge economy , and mechanisms to transfer effectively ideas from the laboratory bench to the marketplace . 
and we need to ensure that the innovation process is built on a strong and healthy foundation . 
the increased support to the granting councils will ensure that a healthy foundation exists . 
it will enable them to forge new partnerships with our universities such as the University of Windsor , to attract the best research minds in the world . 
this will be developed through the innovative program of 21 st century chairs for research excellence that the Prime Minister outlined in his speech . 
through the research granting councils the Government of Canada will fund the creation of 1,200 chairs . 
the committee also heard that the number of students in the natural sciences and engineering is increasing and the need for support for funding their research in this area is increasing correspondingly . 
we also know that the government must intervene and act in order to help the challenges of commercialization . 
as Robert Giroux from the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada said , " To me , the major impediments are the ability of the universities to identify the potential for a research product , and secondly being able to move that product to the marketplace '' . 
we know the throne speech identified that the Canadian government will help to assist in the commercialization of research from universities and government centres . 
this is now a priority of the government . 
the government also understands that Canadians cannot be productive and prosperous if they are not healthy . 
in the throne speech we confirmed our continued commitment to ensuring that our health care system will meet the needs of our growing population . 
we will build on our health record by supporting partners and testing innovations in home care , pharmacare and integrated service delivery over the next two years . 
a modern health information system will make health information more accessible to professionals and our citizens . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it being 6.15 p.m. , it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the amendment to the amendment now before the House . 
the question is on the amendment to the amendment .

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the House resumed from October 14 consideration of the motion for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at the opening of the session and of the amendment . 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , continuing the debate today I would like to talk about health . 
our health depends on safe and healthy food and I would like to remind the House that the agricultural industry in my riding is one of the largest in southeastern Canada . 
the growing season is the longest in Canada , averaging 212 days , with 350,000 acres of rich fertile and relatively flat farmland . 
farmers provide an annual yield of fruits and vegetables , legumes and grains totalling over $ 200 million annually . 
today more than 50 food and beverage processing plants account for over $ 1 billion in shipments . 
our farmers take pride in nurturing the soil and producing the freshest and healthiest produce possible . 
to assist the farmers in my riding of Essex and elsewhere we will use the upcoming World Trade Organization negotiations , including those on agriculture , to help build a more transparent rules based global trading system , one that ensures a level playing field , provides better access to world markets for Canadian companies in all sectors and respects the needs of Canadians , our culture and the environment . 
i would like to remind the House that agricultural production and its future is the very soul of this nation . 
the Liberal government has been and will continue to be a very strong supporter of agriculture . 
as the throne speech stated , Canada ' s ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be a part of Canada ' s strength in the 21 st century . 
just yesterday Canada ' s leading automakers announced a new fuel endorsement program designed to encourage gasoline retailers to sell fuels that meet strict specifications , including lower sulphur , positive combustion chamber deposit controls , no heavy metal additives and enhanced driveability characteristics . 
those retailers who meet these specifications will be able to obtain a licence to use the automakers ' choice logo and designation . 
to quote General Motor ' s president Maureen Kempston Darkes : " If all vehicles on the road in Canada today could access automakers ' choice gasoline , it would be the equivalent of eliminating the smog - causing emissions from almost two million cars and light trucks '' . 
this will positively affect all Canadians and my constituents by reducing the already unacceptable levels of air pollution in Windsor and Essex county . 
we will go further . 
by improving our physical infrastructure for the 21 st century we will not only aid trade and economic growth , we will ensure that we have clean air and water . 
the government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach by the end of the year 2000 an agreement on a five year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country . 
tourism is a multibillion dollar industry in Windsor and Essex which attracts day - trippers and vacationers by bridge or tunnel to an uncrowded , relaxed and safe destination . 
tourism accounts for our fourth largest industry , with 12 % of the workforce or 16,300 people employed in accommodations , food service , amusement and recreation . 
the Ambassador Bridge is North America ' s number one international border crossing , with over 10 million vehicles per year travelling between our two great nations . 
municipalities in my riding and individual companies have communicated to me the importance of creating a better highway system to ensure the safety of our citizens , the efficient movement of our trades and goods , and to increase the movement of people to our tourist attractions . 
with the millennium approaching , Canada is preparing for the arrival of the 21 st century and its immediate future . 
we cannot speak of the future without looking to our children . 
this government recognizes that the viability and economic strength of this nation depend on the opportunities we give our children today . 
if Canada is going to be the place to be in the knowledge based economy of the 21 st century , young Canadians , our leaders and innovators of tomorrow , must be equipped with state of the art high tech skills . 
as well , they must have access to the tools and educational opportunities which will help them apply their creative talents and hone their skills . 
the community access program has ensured that we will have public Internet sites connected in 10,000 rural and urban areas by the year 2000 and Computers for Schools , whose goal of providing 250,000 computers for Canadian schools , is 60 % complete . 
the throne speech reaffirms that we will build on this strong foundation and use the world leading high tech infrastructure we are putting in place , not only to enhance the skills and opportunities of young Canadians , but also to broaden their understanding of their fellow Canadians and the Canadian experience . 
as the nation ' s finances have improved , the government has begun to deliver broad based tax relief totalling $ 16.5 billion over three years . 
as the nation ' s finances continue to improve , the government will further reduce taxes to increase the disposable income of Canadians , enhance innovation and risk taking , and create a more robust economy . 
in its next budget the government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reductions . 
i have had my opportunity to comment on the throne speech and the vision the government has unveiled to bring our strong nation into the next millennium . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to take a look at some things that have happened since 1993 . 
about 40 % of farmers are considering bankruptcy at this very moment . 
this morning there are about 166,000 out of every million children who are going to school hungry . 
they are living in poverty . 
that is nearly three times as bad as it was in 1993 . 
the people on hundreds of reserves in this country are living in squalor . 
i have seen it with my own eyes . 
i know what is there . 
we have a fishery problem that is going on now . 
it is unbelievable that it would come to this , and all since 1993 . 
we have first degree cop killers , murderers , walking away from minimum security institutions . 
we have killers in minimum security institutions and this throne speech talks about the safety of Canadians as a top priority . 
when we look at what is going on today and that which has occurred since 1993 , I would suggest to the Canadian people throughout this land that this entire front row is filled with incompetent people , including the Prime Minister . 
how would the member respond to these tragedies that are happening today , right before her eyes ? 
Ms. Susan Whelan : 
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect to the hon. member , which is hard for me to find right now , the government has already invested an additional $ 1.7 billion toward low income families and children . 
the member who just spoke voted against that . 
he now has the nerve to stand in the House and talk about poverty and children when he voted against money going to low income families and to children . 
we have new programs in our schools . 
we are connected to the Internet with leading edge technology . 
we are investing in research . 
we are attracting the best and brightest to Canada . 
maybe the hon. member should come to the industry committee once in a while and hear what researchers in Canada have to say about the opportunities that exist in Canada and what attracts them . 
the bottom line is not the dollars . 
it is where they can go and what they can do . 
if members on that side would show up at committee they would obviously know that . 
since they are never there they cannot say anything about it . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously we have again heard non - answers from a government member to some very direct questions from my colleague from Wild Rose . 
the member talked about being on track . 
the member mentioned broad based tax relief as though the government had actually delivered it . 
we talk about the $ 16 billion of tax relief but we do not mention that we have raised and wrung $ 18 billion more out of Canadians at the very same time . 
that is a net loss and the member has the gall to stand in her place and defend her government by saying that it has provided broad based tax relief . 
how can she do that ? 
Ms. Susan Whelan : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the math on the other side is a little distorted as usual . 
when we go from double digit unemployment to single digit unemployment we obviously will have more Canadians working . 
more Canadians working means more tax dollars . 
that is why we have been able to provide $ 16.5 billion in tax relief and why we made a very clear announcement in the throne speech . 
in case they did not hear me the first time , we very clearly state in the throne speech that the government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reductions . 
Canadians know that we have a balanced approach . 
Canadians supported us in the 1997 election on a balanced approach . 
i know it bothers some members on the opposite side to think that Canadians want social programs at the same time as they want balance , with debt reduction and tax relief . 
just the other day I had a dinner meeting and by chance two people there , one from the health care sector and one who makes substantial amounts of money from a different type of profession , were at odds on what should happen , but both of them agreed that we have to support the social programs as much as we have to provide tax relief . 
i very clearly answered the question when I stated that we have gone from double digit to single digit unemployment . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
reflecting on the throne speech , some Liberals seem to believe that spending money on government programs aimed at children will help with the challenges that Canadian families face . 
unfortunately , investing in more new federal programs , the latest code word being investing , is really just more spending and spending financed by whom ? 
it is financed by parents . 
it completely misses the importance of families in their struggles . 
the issues and pressures facing Canadian families are bigger than a few new spending programs . 
everything from fiscal and economic policy to justice and community safety issues all affect family units . 
tax inequalities and inequities mean that families have to consider what effect employment decisions will have on their tax bill . 
1020 
a massive underground economy means that families are the victims of an especially unbalanced tax burden . 
lower productivity means a less vibrant economy , higher long term and youth unemployment . 
youth unemployment is almost twice the rate of overall unemployment . 
many of the jobs young people get are across the border . 
the brain drain is a real thing and it is breaking up families . 
oppressive regulations and bloated bureaucracies stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that is birthed within the family . 
a lax attitude toward crime and criminals and using our communities as test laboratories for rehabilitating early parolees makes danger on our streets and violence in the playground sometimes a reality . 
probably a most significant concern to many in the House is the political interference and anti - democratic patronage which weakens the faith of our young people in the system . 
special interest group funding , political slush fund contributions and other frivolous attitudes toward spending tax dollars encourages a sort of family tax rage . 
children and families are all affected by these issues . 
we have heard the government talk about its concern for children but I and other members of the House have repeatedly heard it refuse to deliver even when it had the opportunity to do so . 
this is a government that says it is against child pornography , it is for greater protection from child sex offenders and it is against family tax discrimination . 
let us look at its actions because that is really the most telling sign . 
we have seen , in the country , the courts strike down laws that make child pornography illegal . 
we saw 79 Liberal MPs and senators write a letter to the Prime Minister urging him not to wait for the appeal of the B.C. decision to be heard but to immediately act in defence of Canada ' s children . 
these Liberal members recommended that strong new child pornography legislation be introduced as soon as the House returns . 
that sounds good . 
i and I am sure all the members of my party would have signed that letter . 
in fact , they even went on in the letter to encourage the Prime Minister to consider the use of the notwithstanding clause to send a clear message that Canada ' s charter of rights and freedoms would never again be used to defend sexual abuse of Canadian children . 
let us talk about another situation . 
the Liberals had an opportunity to protect children from convicted sex offenders but failed . 
bill C - 69 was in the Senate before the pension bill but they overlooked that and went for the money . 
they pushed through the pension bill to grab the money and left our children less protected . 
if that is not a telling sign of priorities , I do not know what is . 
actions speak louder than words to Canadians . 
let us look at another one . 
the Liberals have refused and failed to end the tax discrimination faced by single income families with children . 
we know that in the last federal budget a typical single earner family with two children , a family of four with a $ 45,000 income , pays about $ 4,900 in personal tax . 
the same single income family is paying 136 % more than a dual earner family . 
that is right out of the budget . 
however , the Liberals voted against the motion in the House that addresses tax discrimination . 
they said no . 
the vote was 123 in favour , most united on this side , and 145 against on that side . 
this affirms again that the true vision of the Liberals is a continuation of their legacy of high taxes and less choice for families . 
the Liberal MPs say that they are concerned about pornography and child pornography . 
what are they doing about it ? 
nothing . 
we hear that they are concerned about protecting our kids , but when they had a chance to do something about it they did nothing . 
the Liberals talk about caring for and wanting to address tax discrimination in the country . 
they had the opportunity but did not move on it . 
what is all this talk about a legacy ? 
we hear them talking about a legacy . 
the Prime Minister wants a legacy . 
the Liberal member from St. Paul ' s was quoted in the Hamilton spectator as saying : " We want something that is a legacy '' . 
will anyone remember if we gave them tax cuts ? 
if we are going to be remembered we must do some great thing , some great national project . 
this begs the question of what is more important to them , their legacy or our children . 
parents look after the needs of kids best but it looks like they might also be asked to finance the Liberals ' legacy building project . 
where is the credibility in all of this when we hear all this talk about a children ' s agenda ? 
to me it sounds more like an agenda for children . 
the Liberal member for Sarnia - Lambton was quoted recently . 
i have to agree with the member , although I think his career path in the Liberal Party is going to be severely stilted and derailed . 
he fears that the national children ' s agenda is a code word for big spending , social engineering and government meddling . 
this was said by a Liberal member and I can agree with him . 
he is right on . 
i have to inform the government that it actually already has a legacy . 
the Liberal legacy is one of high tax , of high national debt , of increasing taxes and of a huge national debt borne by our children . 
families in Canada are actually aware of the Liberal government ' s agenda . 
they are quite confident that they have the ability to look after the children . 
statistics Canada noted in a recent study that by far the majority of children living in Canada are in excellent and very good health according to their parents . 
i do not think parents want interference by the Liberal government . 
they want to be left to raise their families as they see fit . 
they want a government that will give them less taxes and less government . 
they want a government that respects the natural authority of parents and the choices they are best suited to make on behalf of their children . 
i have a lot more to say but I will leave it for another time . 
my number one concern is that families in the country be given the respect and the freedom to raise their children as they see fit . 
that the amendment be amended by inserting after the words " airline industry '' , the words : " and give Canadians some indication of its vision of Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century '' . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the question is on the amendment to the amendment . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the last speaker mentioned that parents look after their children best . 
over all I would agree with him except that there are situations where parents do not always look after the needs of their children best . 
it is not because they do not want to but in some circumstances they cannot . 
does the hon. member think that every parent should be the teacher of their child or the doctor of their child ? 
as citizens , as a group , can we not help each other look after our children ? 
everything a government does is not necessarily some sort of nefarious interference with those of us who are raising our children . 
in fact we can help each other build a stronger society by helping relieve the stress of a single person or a single couple looking after their children exclusively . 
Mr. Eric Lowther : 
Mr. Speaker , I think that is a very reasonable question . 
i want to be clear on this particular point . 
i am in no way advocating that as a community and as a nation of caring people we do not support one another or that we do not encourage one another in the rearing of our children . 
what I am focusing on is the natural authority of parents in their families to make their decisions . 
when they want to seek help and when they want to get advice from their neighbours , their community or even from their government , that should be a decision left solely in the hands of the parents to decide . 
i am not talking about situations of neglect or abuse where perhaps there is a legitimate requirement for a government to have some intervention . 
we are primarily concerned that public policy and government policy respect the role of parents to make the decisions in the best interest of their children . 
they should be able to make those choices in a fair way where tax policies do not discriminate against one choice over another . 
there should be a fair and equal playing field for parents to make the decisions because they are the ones who can best make the needs assessments of their children . 
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Hamilton West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I just read over the hon. member ' s amendment to the amendment . 
after the words " airline industry " he wants to insert the words " and give Canadians some indication of its vision of Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century '' . 
could the hon. member tell me whether or not he is aware of the process the government and in fact all parties of the House of Commons are going through at this very moment ? 
it is the only committee of the House of Commons to get moving on its work . 
yesterday we had our first meeting . 
as early as Monday afternoon we are meeting with an agenda . 
from all indications from my colleagues on the committee , as well as the critic for the member ' s party , the airline issue is probably the issue the committee will be seized with immediately . 
the member indicates that he is looking to the government to provide vision . 
there are members on this side of the House who are concerned . 
they are bringing their concerns to the attention of our internal economic development committee chaired by the member for Stoney Creek , and that will move forward . 
is the hon. member aware of all these different things that are going on , including the Competition Bureau which will make representation to the minister by the end of the month in the form of a report ? 
the Minister of Transport is being seized with this issue and is getting all this input . 
i wonder if the member can acknowledge that all this work is being done . 
Mr. Eric Lowther : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , I am aware of that work being done . 
i am not saying it should intrude in that situation , but at the same time I am saying there is a vacuum over there . 
there is no plan . 
it is trying to cope with the realities of the marketplace and struggling with how to do it . 
i am aware of what the hon. member is pointing out , but we are not seeing any clear direction from the government at all . 
it is trying to cope with the situation . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to enter into the debate on the Speech from the Throne . 
it is quite evident from what was not in the Speech from the Throne that the government is clearly failing in a number of areas . 
there was a failure of the Liberal government to acknowledge those issues or spell them out in any remote detail or even in any generality . 
one of the major four areas is the fishing crisis happening on our east coast . 
the government did not talk about that or mention it in the throne speech . 
the government did not address agriculture in that throne speech . 
that is a major issue for many hard working Canadians in the agricultural field and it affects all of us . 
it has neglected to talk about the airline industry , as was just pointed out by my colleague for Calgary Centre . 
it has failed to talk about immigration and the crisis happening in the broken system that became so clearly evident this past summer off the west coast of Vancouver . 
i will focus most of my attention in my speech this morning on the broken immigration system and the failure of the government to address the crying need for change in that area . 
it is woeful that the government has not taken action . 
the incidents that happened this past summer of which all Canadians across the country are aware have in essence highlighted and shone a beacon of light on the government ' s failure in this area . 
my colleagues that were here years before I came here made a lot of proactive positive suggestions to the ministers of immigration , to the government , to the Prime Minister , and they have not acted on them . 
they rebut any idea of change out of hand because it comes from opposition members or from anybody else . 
they believe they have the answers and will do what they want . 
members of the opposition will continue to urge that the government take action . 
failing that , we will work in whatever way possible to become the government so that we can put in place proactive positive approaches that solve glaring problems across the country which the government is not willing to even go near . 
i will move into a little more detail about some of points made about our immigration system . 
i will quote a piece of information that came from a report commissioned by the minister of immigration entitled " Not Just Numbers : 
a Canadian Framework for Future Immigration '' . 
this study was put together by some independent individuals who did a broad based consultation process , in the government ' s own words , to find out what needs to be done . 
here is something that was included in the report : 
in recent years in Canada , over half of all the asylum - seeking arrivals at ports of entry had destroyed all identification documents before being seen by officials - 
it goes on to say : 
recent arrivals have mainly come from countries which are stable enough to provide identification documents . 
generally , these individuals are uncooperative and refuse to provide their names , their countries of origin , or anything else that might assist the expeditious processing of their claim . 
the idea that all such persons are reluctant to give such details because of refugee - based fears , or that the persons helping them enter Canada are latter - day Raoul Wallenbergs , is naive . 
the people - smuggling business is now as lucrative as the international drug trade . 
this was in a report submitted to the government , commissioned by the government and in fact has been lost on the government . 
it is another report that has simply been shelved or put away to gather dust for another day . 
we can say this because the government has rejected that notion out of hand as well as many other proposals which have been put forward . 
it is a shame that is its approach to governing . 
immigration department officials in response to the people smuggling that occurred on the west coast this past summer have said the following . 
an Immigration Canada spokesperson named Jim Redmond has said : 
it ' s hard on the people who are smuggled . 
it ' s organized crime at its worst . 
he also said : 
there is a good chance we could have more arrivals this year . 
it would be naive to say it ' s all over . 
what appears to be happening is that the Liberal government is hoping the issue will just fade away . 
if it does nothing long enough other issues will pop up which will take the attention away from this glaring failure within its mandate so that it does not have to act on it . 
the underlying approach of the government is if it does not do anything long enough maybe people will forget about it . 
people are not forgetting about it . 
they are realizing that the government is failing in the area of addressing the immigration system . 
i have sat with my colleagues for two years on the immigration committee . 
we have had many good debates . 
we have tried to work together . 
we have had many very heated debates at times too about the issue because it is a very important one . 
we have been able to work co - operatively at times to look at ideas and solutions . 
what tends to happen is they get rejected because they are not approved by the minister , by the prime minister or by the cabinet . 
that is a shame too because there are many things we would like to see happen that are not happening . 
the Reform Party offers a proactive positive approach rather than this force of negativity of doing nothing offered by the Liberal government . 
we have ideas , suggestions and solutions which have been put forward time and time again . 
i will mention a few of them . 
those who are not true refugees will abuse that and often do . 
they disappear and do not go to their hearings . 
that is a problem . 
we need a system that addresses that , a system that has individuals maintained in an area until it is determined whether they are really refugees or not . 
that process needs to be expedited . 
it cannot go on for years and years and years as it currently does . 
it is not fair to them and it is not fair to Canadians . 
that process needs to be determined quickly , in a matter of days and weeks , not months and years . 
it needs to be done quickly , and once a decision is made , then it should be acted upon . 
if the person is determined not to be a refugee , then they should be removed from our country post - haste . 
if a person is determined to be a refugee , then they should be integrated into our communities as quickly as possible . 
the Liberal government ' s approach is to leave people ' s lives in limbo , to allow people who are not refugees to be here and then to go after people who are true refugees and deport them . 
the system is broken at both ends and this Liberal government is failing . 
the facts are in . 
the perception across our country is that this government does not think it is a problem . 
the Prime Minister himself said there is nothing wrong with our immigration laws and there is nothing wrong with our refugee process . 
he said that this summer . 
in light of what is happening on the west coast , it is unbelievable . 
it is absolutely shocking that this government , in the light of information , details and facts from its own people , fails to act . 
it is unbelievable . 
i urge my colleagues on the government side to apply pressure to change the system . 
failing that , the members of the opposition will work day after day in this place , in committee and on the streets of our nation to be proactive and positive . 
we will make a commitment here and now that we will change the system not only within immigration , but within all the other areas outlined in the Leader of the Opposition ' s speech for a positive vision for the future of this country , because it is clear that today in this land the Liberal government has failed and is visionless . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like the hon. member to comment on something I find very interesting . 
there has not been one question or comment on his presentation from the members opposite . 
the Liberals are afraid to tackle difficult issues and this is a difficult issue . 
i would like the member to comment on the government ' s handling of this issue , in particular that none of the government members are willing to ask a question or make a comment on the issue . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , I can only say in response to that very good comment from my colleague that it is clear that the government has no answers . 
the member for Vancouver - Kingsway across the way is a member of the immigration committee . 
she is simply not offering any solutions . 
members of the government , ministers of the crown have said very interesting things . 
that is what he has said . 
an hon. member : 
wait until winter . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
that is right . 
the minister said wait until the weather gets bad so the ships stop coming . 
what kind of approach is that ? 
that is the government ' s solution to a very important issue . 
it is a do nothing approach , just wait and hope that people do not notice . 
well , people have noticed . 
if the Liberals will not change the system , we will work day after day to sit on that side in order to put in place our proactive solutions . 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker let me say to the deputy citizenship critic for the Reform Party that as usual he has it wrong . 
look at Canada and the success that we have had . 
as a matter of fact Canada has been named the best country in the world for the last six years and it is because of the people we have in this country . 
the people in this country were immigrants or refugees at one point in time . 
when the member says he wants to make a determination on refugee cases in a matter of days or weeks , he is wrong . 
we cannot have a judicial system or any system that has any kind of justice that can make a determination on somebody ' s life in a day or a week . 
this is the problem the Reform Party brings to this House . 
the Reform Party has simplistic solutions that are not viable . 
our government is acting responsibly to combat international smuggling of human beings . 
the opposition parties , particularly the Reform Party on this issue , are like ambulance chasers . 
it is succeeding . 
members opposite can blow and shout but the reality is we have a system which we are continuously working on to improve . 
it is a very good and a very fair system , one which will be even better . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a broken system . 
the member is in la - la land . 
the member sits on the immigration committee and he talks about simplistic answers . 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration said wait until winter so the boats do not come anymore . 
what about that for a simplistic answer . 
that is the suggestion offered by the minister and her mouthpiece the member for Kitchener - Waterloo . 
i was in the member ' s community . 
that is the kind of approach the member takes to constituent work . 
now he has no answers . 
his government has no answers to this crisis . 
it is clear . 
the facts are in . 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to tell my colleague that our government not only cares but it also takes action . 
last month the Chinese government invited a small delegation of three Liberal MPs to go there . 
we had a very long and detailed discussion to establish co - operation between China and Canada to tackle the problem of human smuggling . 
it is the beginning of our work on immigration . 
there are many things we can tell the House . 
we not only take on our concerns but members ' concerns are also in our hands . 
we are trying to solve the problems . 
we do not just sit in this House and talk . 
talk is too easy . 
the government takes action . 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
Mr. Speaker , to simply say something and say it is true is an interesting concept . 
actions speak louder than words . 
the member ' s solution to the immigration crisis is to make an educational video and send that across the waters to folks so that they know to please not come because we are not sure what to do with them when they get here . 
that is the member ' s approach to this crisis . 
rather than work for legislative change with some teeth in it that will make a change and send a message internationally that Canada is not an easy mark for those who would abuse our immigration system , the member and her colleagues sit idly by and offer solutions such as waiting for winter so the boats stop coming , or putting together an educational video so that people stop coming . 
those are their suggestions , rather than using the legislative powers we have in the House to take action and make a change . 
we can work together in the House to make legislative changes to send a message internationally that Canada will not be an easy mark for those who choose to abuse our system . 
we want a positive system . 
a member has shouted out a comment that I am not going to repeat because it is in contempt . 
he said it the other day in question period under his breath . 
he does not have the intestinal fortitude to stand in his place and make that accusation because he knows he would be thrown directly out of this place . 
he does not have the guts to stand and deliver ; rather he holds his hand in front of his face and utters scurrilous remarks toward opposition members . 
that is the approach of the government , to run scared , to do nothing and utter attacks against those who offer positive proactive solutions for change . 
shame on the member and shame on every one of the Liberal members for standing idly by and doing nothing once again . 
that is the Liberal government ' s approach to governing . 
shame on the Liberal members . 
the day will come soon when we will be in the Liberal government ' s place making positive proactive solutions to address the concerns of this nation because the Liberal government simply refuses to do so . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i know we could go on with questions and comments but really the time has expired . 
given the liveliness of the debate for a Friday , perhaps we should move on to Standing Order 31 Statements by Members . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
older PERSONS 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 1 , 1999 the Canadian Medical Association joined the United Nations in celebrating the International Day of Older Persons which was put in place to recognize the contributions to society of our older citizens . 
older persons across the country and around the world are an active and important part of society . 
as fellow members of society , it is our duty to ensure these older persons receive the health care and special services they need and deserve . 
the federal government recognizes these needs and is committed to working with Canadians to continually improve our health care system . 
we must accommodate the changing demands of our aging and increasing population . 
the International Day of Older Persons gave us the opportunity to really look at this important sector of our population . 
older persons have special health care needs and services which must be made readily available to them . 
i would like to applaud the Canadian Medical Association ' s efforts during this international day . 
i urge Canadians to work together with each other and with the government to ensure our older persons are well taken care of .

genetically ENGINEERED FOODS 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak on behalf of many Canadians in my riding of Nanaimo - Cowichan and across the country who are concerned about the introduction of genetically engineered foods to the marketplace . 
while everyone is interested in ensuring that the world ' s food supply grows and that the hunger pangs of children and indeed all people disappear , there are many who share concern about the safety of genetically engineered foods . 
there are too many outstanding issues and too many questions of what if . 
these questions require full answers . 
the safety of our food supply cannot and must not fall into question . 
we must learn from past failures , such as the testing of our blood supply , and ensure the public that the same mistakes will not be made again . 
we must take time now to ensure that the safety of these foods is without question . 
i have currently submitted a private member ' s bill to be drafted that calls for further investigation into the regulations concerning genetically engineered foods and their mandatory labelling . 
until this process is complete , I believe that the questions will remain unanswered . 
in the near future I will be asking for support of this bill by the members of the House .

gasoline PRICES 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there was a huge jump in the price of gas in Ontario this summer . 
in addition , the major oil companies continue to jerk around gas prices and Canadians to maximize their profits . 
i know the price of crude oil has gone up , but that in no way explains current high gas prices . 
some say that more than seven cents of the new price is excess profits for the corporations . 
i urge the government to initiate another inquiry into the lack of competition in gas pricing in Ontario . 
i believe the virtual elimination of small retailers has produced a monopoly in the province . 
i also urge the government to persuade the Government of Ontario to use the threat of gas price regulation , which is clearly in the jurisdiction of Queen ' s Park , to pressure the oil companies to change their ways . 
* * * 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to congratulate a fellow islander , Mr. Wade MacLaughlan , on his recent appointment as the President of the University of Prince Edward Island . 
Mr. MacLaughlan was installed as the fifth president and vice chancellor of UPEI on October 3 . 
he was chosen from among the country ' s leading academics for , among other things , his solid record in university administration with the University of New Brunswick . 
Mr. MacLaughlan holds several degrees , including a Master of Law from Yale University . 
his passionate commitment to the island , outstanding experience in university administration and wealth of connections to the community will help strengthen UPEI . 
indeed , UPEI will be the place to be as we turn the century . 
congratulations to Wade , his family and all islanders . 
* * * 
organ DONATION 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish ( Mississauga Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure it will surprise many to learn that Canada has one of the lowest organ donations rates in the world . 
last spring the Minister of Health asked the Standing Committee on Health to examine this very important issue and to make recommendations about ways to improve Canada ' s regretful donation rates . 
the committee tabled its report in April and I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister of Health tabled the government ' s response to that report with the clerk earlier today . 
i am also pleased to note that when Canada ' s health ministers met last month in Charlottetown they agreed to establish a council on organ and tissue donation and transplantation in Canada . 
this will give Canada a co - ordinated , comprehensive and integrated donation and transplantation strategy across the country . 
the council ' s business plan will be reviewed in November . 
it is my hope that these efforts will go a long way to improving Canada ' s organ donation rate .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have had the privilege over the past two years of working with some of the most extraordinary Canadians I have ever met . 
first and foremost is a lady by the name of Leona Freed . 
Ms. Freed has built the First Nation ' s Accountability Coalition in an effort to restore hope to those feeling hopelessness at the hands of chiefs and councils on their reserves . 
i must also recognize people like Yolande Redcalf , Greg Twoyoungmen , Rita King , Edwin One Owl , Roy Littlechief , Mike Calder , Laura Deedza and Debbie Neepoose , just to name a few . 
each of these people have selflessly contributed to the fight for a better life for future generations .

world FOOD DAY 
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Saturday , October 16 has been designated World Food Day . 
at the world food summit in Rome in November 1996 Canada joined 186 other nations to endorse the summit ' s goal , which is to reduce the number of undernourished people by half by the year 2015 . 
canada ' s action plan for food security , launched by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food on World Food Day last year , is the result of that commitment . 
as a major exporter of food and related products and expertise , and as one of the largest donors of food aid , Canada has made some very valuable contributions to world food security . 
fighting food insecurity is a collective effort by government , by civil society , by business and by communities . 
it is also an individual effort from all of us . 
on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food and myself I encourage everyone to demonstrate their concern by contributing a food donation to their local food bank . 
this year ' s theme is " Youth Against Hunger '' . 
this is a good time to remind Canada ' s young people of the positive role they can play in the fight against worldwide hunger and in the achievement of food security for all .

foster FAMILIES 
Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we forget and all too often minimize the contribution made by foster families in our society . 
in Quebec , the third week of October is set aside to officially honour foster families . 
i therefore take this opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary support foster families provide in our society . 
we therefore honour foster families for their invaluable contribution to society . 
on behalf of the members of the Bloc Quebecois , I would like to thank them and congratulate them on their unending efforts on behalf of our young people .

DYSTONIA AWARENESS WEEK 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past week , October 10 to 17 , was designated Dystonia Awareness Week . 
Dystonia is an illness characterized by involuntary spasms and muscle contractions . 
this condition results in abnormal movements and posture and can affect various body parts like the eyes , neck and limbs . 
Dystonia is often diagnosed as another ailment like arthritis or stress . 
to date there is no known cause or cure , but efforts have been made to change that . 
the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation offers support to sufferers through patient advocacy , public awareness , professional education and fundraising for research . 
i invite my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the many volunteers with the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation . 
we offer them our best wishes for a successful campaign .

Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday one of the most visionary and illustrious sons of Africa passed away . 
Julius Nyerere , the former president of Tanzania , who was one of the leading figures in Africa ' s struggle for independence in its post - colonial era , lost his battle with leukemia . 
as a former citizen of Tanzania I can attest to his greatness . 
while I disagreed with his economic and political philosophy , he commanded a high degree of respect from all Tanzanians , Africans and other citizens of the world . 
he was respected because his citizens came first . 
throughout Tanzania and Africa he was best known as Mwalimu , which means a teacher in Kiswahili . 
after his retirement he continued to play an advisory role in Tanzanian and regional politics . 
the world looked upon him to play a role in carving a bright future for Africa . 
Kwahir Mwalimu .

doctors WITHOUT BORDERS 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that all members of the House will want to join with me in congratulating Doctors Without Borders on their nomination for the Nobel Prize this year . 
doctors Without Borders represents for most of us the best of what has developed in the latter part of this troubled century . 
it is an international NGO , formed originally in France , which is now throughout the world , including Canada . 
it provides the opportunity for doctors to serve their fellow human beings across the globe , often at great risk to themselves and in places such as Kosovo , East Timor and remote corners of Asia and Africa . 
as we go into the 21 st century the world is changing and borders are losing their significance . 
doctors Without Borders is leading the way in breaking down those borders in the name of humanitarian principles which respond to the way in which Canadians see the world . 
we all rejoice in their recognition by the Nobel committee and wish them well in their important work .

nuclear TEST BAN TREATY 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the New Democratic Party of Canada and its members of parliament join with the Canadian government , the prime ministers of the United Kingdom , Germany and France and many others around the world , including of course millions of Americans and President Clinton , in regretting the tragic , stupid , shortsighted and dangerous decision of the American Senate in rejecting the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty . 
if some day the world is destroyed because of a nuclear war , those who are left , if there are any , may look back on this week as a negative turning point in the struggle to rid the world of nuclear weapons . 
a senate dominated by right wingers decided to trust in their nuclear chariots and their determination to take on all comers in a possible nuclear war instead of encouraging and building a world in which nuclear non - proliferation and abolition of nuclear weapons is seen as the way ahead . 
perhaps the Republicans should check the historical record to see what eventually happens to empires which trust more in their weapons than in the will of God for a just , peaceful and non - nuclear world .

ordre DU M É RITE AGRICOLE 1999 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on September 30 , Quebec announced the winners of the Ordre du m é rite agricole 1999 contest , thus giving recognition to the work of the agricultural producers , artists of the land , who have been feeding Quebec since its beginnings . 
the purpose of this competition is to recognize excellence and it has long been a part of the Quebec farm scene . 
Turcotte farm of Val - Brillant ; the Viel farm of Saint - Alexandre - de - Kamouraska ; the Carol and Alain Perron farm of La Baie ; the egg producers Les Oeufs d ' or of Val d ' Or , the nursery La P é pini è re Aiken of Rouyn - Noranda and the P é tri farm of Saint - Andr é - de - Kamouraska . 
today I would like to draw attention to the excellence and expertise of these agricultural professionals , and to wish a continued long life to the Ordre du m é rite agricole competition .

honourable ANTONIO LAMER 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past August 21 , the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court announced his resignation in the following words " Having heard 1,317 cases on the Supreme Court and written reasons in 345 of them , I have decided to hang up my robes early in the next millennium '' . 
called to the Bar of Quebec in 1957 , Antonio Lamer practiced criminal law until his appointment to the Quebec Superior Court on December 19 , 1969 . 
Mr. Lamer has had an impressive career and the people of Canada wish him the best in his future endeavours .

TOBIQUE FIRST NATION 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , members of the Tobique First Nation are fed up . 
the department of Indian affairs transfers $ 13 million annually to the Tobique band council , yet the council has recently run up a $ 10 million deficit . 
over the past year many band members have met with me to show how the council ' s mismanagement and the department ' s lack of accountability have prevented band members from realizing the benefits of tax dollars . 
last year the band had to suspend medical services and lay off their nurse . 
at the same time , councillors voted to raise their own pay to $ 1,000 per week . 
cheques worth $ 152,000 were written without invoices , authorization or approval . 
the council has violated every one of the remedial management plans it has signed with the department . 
we must have self - government , but government money has to go toward solving the serious social problems at Tobique instead of to band politicians and accountants . 
the members of the Tobique First Nation and I call upon the minister to appoint a third party administrator for Tobique so we can get the band back on its financial feet and help this community thrive .

jean DRAPEAU 
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past August 17 , the people of Quebec paid a final warm tribute to Jean Drapeau , mayor of Montreal for 29 years . 
no one could remain indifferent to this man of action . 
one could oppose him or support him , but never ignore him . 
he was successful in creating pride in his city , through such concrete accomplishments as Expo and the m é tro . 
the memory of this humanist and man of action will remain forever in the contemporary history of Quebec . 
thank you , Mr. Drapeau , for your great contribution to building the international renown of Montreal .

refugees 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , more than 10 years ago the Tory MP at the time , Chuck Cook , called a meeting to discuss immigration at the 800 person capacity Centennial Theatre in North Vancouver . 
so many people came to express their dissatisfaction with Canada ' s sloppy refugee processing system that hundreds had to be turned away at the door . 
within a couple of years of that meeting Chuck Cook was privately telling voters in North Vancouver that the only way to get the laws changed would be to vote Reform in the next election . 
how right he was . 
more than 10 years later , even though the solicitor general ' s department has now confirmed that Canada ' s sloppy immigration system has turned us into a haven for organized crime , absolutely nothing has been done to address these problems . 
the present minister sends out meaningless form letters to the concerned Canadians who are contacting her on this issue , and Chuck Cook ' s truth of 10 years ago remains the truth today . 
the only way the system will ever be changed is when people vote Reform . 
* * * 
first NATIONS 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the supreme court decision in the Marshall case demonstrates the negligence of the department of Indian affairs . 
the minister initiated " Gathering Strength - Canada ' s Aboriginal Action Plan " which was supposed to be a new relationship with first nations . 
the government would negotiate , not litigate . 
now we face old tensions and anger just because this government forces first nations into the courts and refuses to negotiate . 
there should never be a question of honouring a treaty . 
the government makes sure we all abide by the NAFTA and the WTO , but it has ignored agreements signed with the first nations . 
if the government continues to force the first nations all the way to the supreme court we will face more upheaval rather than the peace and friendship the treaties were meant to bring .

fisheries 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Chantal H é bert ' s column " Political dance on native rights " is only partially correct . 
she correctly states that eastern political parties are walking on eggshells but she fails to recognize why . 
my colleague from West Nova and myself as the member of parliament for South Shore understand the fragility of the licensed lobster fishery based on conservation . 
the reason this industry is lucrative is that lobster fishers have adopted licences , carapace sizes , trap limits and an inhospitable winter season to assure a quality product for domestic and export markets . 
this year one lobster fisherman in LFA 35 has been lost at sea . 
we can all see that the cost of being in the industry is extremely high . 
the Reform misled fishers into falsely believing that the decision can be struck down . 
the NDP has completely turned its back on eastern Canada . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
fisheries 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government needs to move quickly if it hopes to relieve tensions in New Brunswick and to prevent similar conflicts from happening in other parts of the country . 
the government has an obligation to all its citizens , not just to select groups . 
it cannot allow the courts to draw racial boundaries through Canada ' s natural resources . 
we have only two days left . 
why will not the government petition the supreme court not to overturn the decision but to stay the decision and then ask for clarification of this Marshall decision ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not see why the Reform Party is again using the term race . 
frankly that is not the way to approach this matter . 
we have to approach it on the basis that we are working together to find solutions which are fair to all concerned . 
why do we not have the support of the Reform Party in this direction rather their using the term race in this matter ? 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , because the government has failed to act we are forced to use the word race . 
by not petitioning the court it is ensuring that we will have a race based fishery in the future . 
most Canadians want equality of all citizens and groups . 
while both groups of fishermen have rights , both native and non - native fishermen , by not petitioning the court , by not asking for clarification , it is ensuring that one group of fishermen has superior rights over another . 
that is not right . 
what gives the government the right to unilaterally quash the principle of equality ? 
both groups of fishermen have rights . 
why not ask the court for clarification on that point ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the supreme court came down with a judgment on September 17 , 1999 . We as the government respect the treaty right and we will live within the spirit of that judgment . 
we have to make clear this is a right by law that the courts have recognized , a contract . 
the crown should respect the promises that it made whether they were made yesterday or whether they were made 240 years ago . 
we will ensure that we live with that . 
today I am happy to announce that I will be appointing a federal representative to start the talks immediately on a long term arrangement to deal with this issue . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the problem is about to get bigger . 
some native leaders now claim that the Marshall decision gives them the right to harvest timber without a licence . 
others claim that they now have mineral rights . 
if the minister does not think that is true , he just has to look at what has been going on in British Columbia all summer . 
i expect the minister may wish that this problem would go away . 
he only has two days left . 
i would urge him to petition the court . 
why will not the government ask the supreme court to stay the ruling , not overturn it , ask for clarification of its meaning , tell all fishermen that their livelihoods will be protected and establish a fisheries policy that has equality as its cornerstone ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what is really important today is that we will have a federal representative who will talk to aboriginal and non - aboriginal groups and sit down to make sure we look at the long term arrangement in the fisheries area . 
in terms of the broader issues , my colleague , the Indian affairs minister , is working very hard so that we can also deal with the broader issues that go beyond the fisheries as well . 
we are making excellent progress . 
why will not that party support that progress ? 
why will it not support aboriginal people and work with us instead of always trying to tear down what we are trying to build up ?

child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are outraged by the government ' s unwillingness to uphold the law against child pornography . 
i have already submitted 150,000 signatures on petitions calling for the government to uphold the law . 
today I will present another 150,000 . 
that is more than a quarter of a million people who have demonstrated their outrage against the government . 
yet the justice minister refuses to budge . 
children agenda my foot . 
how many more concerned Canadians will it take for this government to protect our kids ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member knows and as I think everyone on this side of the House is well aware , the government is committed to children and committed to a national children ' s agenda , unlike our hon. friends on the other side who are in the business of gunning programs that help families and children in the country . 
in relation to the issue of child pornography let me say that our friends on the other side are scaremongers . 
they suggest there are no pornography laws in force in the country . 
it is against the law to produce child pornography , to distribute it , to sell it , and to import it . 
i would ask the Reform Party , as opposed to - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry , but the hon. minister ' s time has expired . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
they are calling on the government to act . 
why is the government being led by nine judges , rather than - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. Minister of Justice . 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again the hon. member chooses to distort the facts . 
he refers to the Alberta case . 
what he fails to accentuate is that the accused person was convicted in that situation . 
convictions for possession of pornography are taking place all over the country . 
i have made it absolutely plain that we will respect the rule of law . 
we are - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Rimouski - Mitis .

GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Industry seems determined not to support the Government of Quebec ' s efforts to modernize the automobile industry in Quebec . 
does the minister realize that , by not backing Minister Landry ' s proposal , he is standing in the way of a plan that , on the one hand , will further the policy of developing new technologies in Quebec and , on the other , will make it possible to train a workforce specialized in this sector and keep it in Quebec ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will not repeat what my colleague , the Minister of Industry , said , because I might not be as eloquent . 
what he said was that the Quebec government is jumping the gun . 
together , we have decided to form a partnership so as to help GM ' s Boisbriand division . 
at this point , I think that everyone agrees that the most important thing is to help the Boisbriand plant find a new model . 
this was the focus of discussions . 
my colleague and I also participated in the study done by the survival committee , and we went to Detroit . 
we are available and will continue to support employees of GM ' s Boisbriand plant . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , more speechifying from the government , but we have nothing concrete to show for it . 
the minister says that the plan is irresponsible and poorly thought out , but the federal government is hardly close to the action . 
does Quebec ' s plan bother the federal government so much that it is prepared to sacrifice Boisbriand for the 14 plants in Ontario ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebec ' s plan does not necessarily bother the federal government , but it should bother Quebec taxpayers . 
at this stage , the important thing is to come up with a new model . 
it is well known that if we can , as a partnership , come up with a new model , the odds are good that GM will not need government assistance , given what happened in the other provinces . 
but now that the Government of Quebec has tipped its hand , there will obviously be no turning back , should a new model later be found . 
the $ 360 million is already on the table and probably ill - advisedly .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this morning the Journal de Montr é al reports that the Montreal urban community police department just completed an investigation on a production company that allegedly falsified the identity of some screen writers and unduly benefited from federal tax credits . 
the newspaper adds that the production company has also been the target of an RCMP investigation . 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
can the minister assure us that she will do her utmost to shed light on this issue , even if some people close to the Liberal party might be directly involved ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I myself found out about the investigation this morning . 
i believe the investigation is still going on and we should let the police do its job . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the minister presumably made some checks , can she confirm that the production company CINAR , which is a contributor to the Liberal Party of Canada and which is headed by Micheline Charest , who is said to have organized a fundraising evening for the Liberal Party of Canada that was attended by the Prime Minister , is not the target of this investigation ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not have any discussions with anyone about the investigation , because it is a police investigation . 
i respect that and I do not get involved in police matters . 
* * * 
agriculture 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister of agriculture . 
yesterday the minister told his counterparts in Manitoba and Saskatchewan that they had to put up some money for the farm crisis themselves . 
that is like asking the farmers to pay for their own crisis as R . B . Bennett did in the 1930 s . 
the minister knows that in Saskatchewan there is a joint position of all parties in the farm groups asking for an additional $ 1 billion in emergency farm aid now , on top of what they already have from last year under AIDA . 
will the minister be forthcoming with that money since he took money out of the programs by eliminating the Crow a few years ago ? 
how much money will come back to the farmers on the prairies ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I did have a very frank and candid discussion with the ministers from Saskatchewan and Manitoba yesterday . 
as they already know agriculture is a shared jurisdiction . 
the safety net support to agriculture for the last numbers of years has been shared 60:40 . 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister is obviously not listening . 
i have a letter from a 14 year old girl in Carragana , Saskatchewan . She is saying that nobody in parliament is listening to her on the farm crisis . 
i wonder if the minister could answer my question directly as to whether or not there will be an extra $ 1 billion going to hard pressed farmers on the prairies . 
would he screw up his courage and come out to the prairies to see for himself the severity of the crisis ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have been out to the prairies and I have seen it for myself . 
i have farmed for a number of years and I know the stress the producers are going through . 
in answer to the specific question , is there another $ 1 billion for the province of Saskatchewan on top of the programs and the money that are already there , no .

fisheries 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we welcome the news that the federal government would appoint a federal negotiator in the Atlantic fisheries crisis . 
it is indeed regrettable that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans can no longer be directly involved in negotiations to settle a fisheries management dispute . 
would the minister agree that the appointment of the negotiator was necessary only because he and his senior bureaucrats have lost all credibility with the people involved ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is total rubbish . 
i know Mr. James MacKenzie who is from Nova Scotia will do an excellent job to make sure we sit down , get all the parties together , and have a long term arrangement . 
meanwhile we have a regulatory fishery out there . 
we are ensuring that we have interim agreements , but this should not reflect on our long term arrangement . 
that is why Mr. MacKenzie has been asked . 
i am very happy that someone of his calibre has accepted this position . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is not total rubbish . 
it is total chaos which the minister has created . 
on Monday , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will be meeting with native leaders in Ottawa . 
the fact that the meeting is taking place in Ottawa is just another slap in the face to Atlantic Canadians . 
we would like to know why the ministers are hiding away in Ottawa . 
why can they not go to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and meet these people where the problem really is ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have been to Atlantic Canada before the hon. member even knew the issue existed . 
i met with all the commercial groups . 
i met with the aboriginal groups . 
we have been working with them . 
we will be willing to meet with them . 
it is extremely important that we sit down to ensure that the aboriginal communities can exercise their treaty rights for the benefit of their members . 
we are going to continue to do that .

immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I talked to the immigration officials in B.C. and they informed me that only four of the 600 Chinese migrants have gone through their initial IRB hearings . 
do the math . 
at this rate the initial hearings of the 600 Chinese migrants will not be completed until 2034 . 
the minister assured Canadians that extra resources would be dedicated to expedite the process . 
is this the minister ' s idea of expedience ? 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear on this question . 
the government has acted and is acting to expedite the process . 
let me further inform the member . 
he knows that the issue we are dealing with is an international one which involves the smuggling of human beings . 
the member knows that this country is one of the leaders in the fight internationally . 
the member knows that but he is trying to exploit it . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , even if the minister manages to get the initial hearings completed in a year , the appeals process will take years . 
these people will spend a significant portion of their lives in detention camps set up by the government . 
i find this to be unacceptable . 
further , every Canadian knows that the longer the process takes , the more it is going to cost taxpayers . 
i want the minister to tell Canadians how much it is going to cost taxpayers to complete this process . 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear for the Reform Party . 
this government is acting expeditiously . 
in a speech in the House a few minutes ago before question period a Reform member said that if the Reform Party were the government it would deal with the issue in days or a matter of weeks . 
we know that we cannot have justice in a day or a matter of weeks unless we have adjudicators of a commandant form and we are not going to have them . 
* * * 
air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the Onex affair , one of the minister ' s conditions is Canadian control of the future air carrier . 
the present Canadian International Airlines - American Airlines agreement gives American veto power in any major decisions , including a potential merger with Air Canada . 
the law limits foreign control of a Canadian carrier to no more than 25 % . 
by blocking any Air Canada offer , American has de facto control over Canadian International Airlines . 
can we trust the minister to respect these five conditions , when he is not even ensuring respect of the present legislation ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , the Canadian Transportation Agency is mandated to examine the conditional agreement accepted by Air Canada ' s shareholders . 
and I have no doubts that the agency will protect the interests of Canadians , and that it will protect the Canadian industry so that it will be operated by Canadians in Canada . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , according to the minister , if section 47 was applied , it was because time was of the essence , since Canadian International Airlines was on the verge of bankruptcy . 
yet the presidents of Canadian International Airlines , American Airlines and Onex all say that Canadian International Airlines will not be going bankrupt in the near future . 
who is telling the truth ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there have been no changes in the arguments that led the government to invoke section 47 . 
i believe the hon. member has raised a good question but , with all due respect , I suggest he raise it with Mr. Benson during the transport committee meetings if he wants the right answer .

agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today we have found out that there is no new money for western Canadian farmers who got nothing from AIDA . 
the minister of agriculture has been quoted in the Western Producer as saying that government could help farmers by offering retraining for a new career . 
does he not realize that the average age of farmers in Saskatchewan is 59 ? 
what career does he think is appropriate for a 59 year old farmer who has lost everything ? 
follow his path and take up politics ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this government has shown very clearly that we care for Canadian farmers to a greater extent than the party across the floor . 
during the summer we made changes to the NISA program to make another $ 121 million available to Canadian farmers . 
we have encouraged them to use those programs . 
we have made changes to the crop insurance program . 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as an emergency assistance program , AIDA has been a cruel joke . 
after almost a year of Liberal fiddling , only a fraction of allocated funds has trickled down to desperate prairie farmers . 
the minister said that money is on the table . 
money on the table is not in farmers ' pockets . 
the worst feature of the program is that to qualify , a farmer has to have three profitable years immediately prior to 1998 . 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think it is sad that the hon. member said that $ 900 million from the federal government and $ 600 million from the provincial government is a cruel joke . 
it is a significant sum of money . 
i can assure the hon. member that all of that money will be spent to assist Canadian farmers .

east TIMOR 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister . 
six weeks after the referendum in East Timor , no Canadian soldiers have yet joined the implementation force on the ground . 
our soldiers are still waiting for their inoculations , which they were late receiving , to take effect . 
how does the Deputy Prime Minister explain such a delay , when the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself was warned by NGOs returning from East Timor that there would be a blood bath ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all we do have troops in East Timor . 
they have taken humanitarian aid . 
they have been going in and out of East Timor . 
they have had one of the highest levels of use of transport aircraft of any of the allied countries involved . 
today our troops in Valcartier are on their way to East Timor . 
they will be training with the New Zealanders and going in at the same time as the New Zealanders . 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is all very fine and well but , in the throne speech , the government said that Canada has the expertise to protect people from threats to their rights , their safety and their lives . 
does the Deputy Prime Minister think that Canada ' s slowness to act is consistent with the policy of human safety advanced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the only reason the ground troops have not been in there earlier is because of the need for inoculation from a very deadly disease . 
would the hon. member have us send our troops in and risk their lives ? 
no , we would not do that . 
we want to make sure they are properly protected to be of service to the people of East Timor . 
the Australians are very anxious for us to get there . 
we are getting there just as quickly as we can . 
we will get there at the same time as the New Zealanders and they are right next door .

agriculture 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Alberta government recognized the worst farm crisis in Canada since the Great Depression by announcing a $ 100 million emergency farm program . 
a disaster income program whose criteria are so tough that farmers cannot access the money . 
i suggest that is the real disaster , the government ' s program . 
what will it take for the minister to wake up and realize that farmers are in a very serious crisis ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we know a number of farmers are having very stressful financial times presently . 
that is why we put the program in place . 
as I said a few minutes ago , the criteria will trigger all of the $ 900 million of federal money and the $ 600 million of the 60:40 split of the money we announced earlier this year . 
* * * 
trade 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is another example of how western farmers are getting the shaft from the government . 
western cattle producers facing a 6 % tariff from the Americans spent their own money to travel to the U.S. to hammer out proposals to end the dispute . 
but the trade and agriculture ministers refuse to listen and do nothing to defend the farmers . 
will the the minister act immediately to implement the ranchers ' solutions which they hammered out to end this discrimination tariff ? 
Mr. Bob Speller ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should know that when the decision came down it was a win for Canada . 
we won a lot of this decision and the hon. member should be happy with that . 
before we sat down and before we put forward the Canadian position on this , we talked to the groups , the industry and the provinces to make sure the position being put forward by the Government of Canada was best reflective of their views . 
we will continue to do that . 
* * * 
audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister just told us she did not contact the police . 
can she also confirm that no member of her staff or her department was in touch with police forces involved in the investigation into the Montreal production company ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I read in the newspaper that Canadian Audio - Visual Certification Office officials are meeting with Revenue Canada , next Thursday . 
so I presume public servants have been in touch with the police . 
* * * 
health RESEARCH 
Mr. Mark Assad ( Gatineau , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health . 
the government recently made some interesting announcements in the area of research . 
i am thinking in particular of the Canadian institutes of health research mentioned in the budget , and of the announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister concerning university chairs . 
could the minister give us an example of funding for university research ? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for Gatineau for his interesting question . 
over the coming weeks and months , we will have the opportunity to discuss the issues of research chairs and institutes of health research . 
at this point , I would like to remind the House that , last month , the Minister of Health and his colleague , the Minister of National Revenue , announced an $ 11.7 million subsidy for health research to the Universit é de Montr éal. 
that money will be used to conduct research on AIDS , cancer and ethical issues relating to genetic changes . 
* * * 
taxation 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are saying that taxes are far too high . 
Cheryl in Burlington wrote to the Minister of Finance this summer and said : " As a stay at home mother of four small children the tax system is unfair . 
we are penalized because we believe that we are best to care for our children , not daycare '' . 
when will tax discrimination which puts purchased daycare over parent care end ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is obviously not aware of the national child tax benefit by which the government put untold millions of dollars into the hands of families . 
it was precisely for middle income families . 
we do recognize the costs incurred by those who have to raise children . 
the real issue is why the Reform opposed the national child tax benefit . 
that is the main issue . 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister has it wrong again . 
he did not answer the question . 
i would like to invest and expand my business but because of heavy tax I have decided to sell out and move '' . 
how is any entrepreneur going to be persuaded to invest in the country when the tax burden is literally breaking the back of small business ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again the hon. member ought to check his facts . 
the fact is we have cut unemployment insurance premiums by $ 4 billion . 
that affects small business immediately . 
we have put money into the small business loans program . 
we had a team Canada mission helping small business export across the country . 
the fact is that the government recognizes that small business is the major job creator in the country and we have supported it to the hilt . 
i will go back . 
the hon. member says that I do not answer questions . 
why did he not answer the question on why the Reform Party opposed the national child tax benefit ? 
* * * 
canada CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
where will the money come from : our pensioners or all the northerners who have been so heavily audited recently ? 
what can possibly justify this $ 1.4 million tax party ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the amount referred to by the hon. member is wrong . 
i will tell the member one more time that the November 1 event will launch the new Canada Customs and Revenue Agency . 
we feel it is worth proceeding with some celebration because , together with our employees and our unions , we are working toward having an agency that will be more client oriented . 
as a government , we are proud of this agency . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government will not honour pay equity . 
there is a farm crisis . 
we have first nations people in the country who go hungry . 
will this new tax agency do what it wants , when it wants with our money ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe the Speech from the Throne has stated quite eloquently what the government has done and what it will do in the near future . 
with regard to the new Canada Customs and Revenue Agency , I told the member that we are very proud of what we are doing . 
this agency will provide much better services to the population . 
we are providing good services now but we want to do much better in the near future .

standing COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a week before the first meeting of the transport committee , the National Post and the the Globe and Mail reported that the Minister of Transport had selected the member for Hamilton West to be elected as the new chair of the committee , even though there had not been a meeting . 
yesterday , right on schedule , all the Liberal members on the committee voted just like the minister predicted they would . 
will the minister commit to respect the committee system and honour the system not preordained - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that while the question may be of interest it does not fall within the administrative competence of the government . 
it is out of order . 
does the hon. member have a supplementary question ? 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , you are probably right , it is out of order because the minister is supposed to stay out of committee affairs . 
committees are supposed to answer to parliament but the minister preordained the vote in a committee meeting . 
i am asking the minister to commit to never doing that again , allow the committee to do its work - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that the hon. member is in as much trouble with his supplementary as he was with the one that he admitted was out of order at the beginning . 
the hon. member for St. Paul ' s .

crime PREVENTION 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Justice . 
on Tuesday the Speech from the Throne said the government would work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe . 
could the minister tell us what initiatives the government has taken to help communities deal with crime ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this gives me the opportunity to share with the House the remarkable success of a program that we on this side of the House are very proud of . 
that is , of course , our crime prevention strategy . 
we on this side of the House believe that one only delivers real public safety and security through an integrated approach to the issue of crime , unlike the hon. members in the Reform Party who seem to believe in simply putting more people in jail for longer . 
on this side of the House we believe in working in communities , with communities in partnership to address the root cause of crime . 
* * * 
taxation 
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , further on high taxes , in a letter to the Minister of Finance , Clinton from Dartmouth wrote , " I ' m part of the working poor . 
instead of creating useless programs , do me a real favour and give me some real tax relief . 
p . S . I want more than just a couple of hundred bucks . 
and get rid of bracket creep while you are at it '' . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
yes , Mr. Speaker , approximately $ 4 billion this year , $ 16.5 billion over the next three years , the most significant tax cuts the country has seen in over a decade . 
that is the answer .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is again for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
can the minister confirm whether or not members of her political staff in her office have contacted the police forces involved in the investigations on a production company from Montreal ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , no one from my office gets involved in a police investigation . 
* * * 
auto PACT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister who is one of the few members of parliament who was here when the auto pact came into being . 
he was probably here as well when parliament and Canadians were assured that the auto pact would not be endangered by the WTO . 
given the number of jobs that are threatened by the WTO decision , many in his home city of Windsor , what does the government plan to do to safeguard the auto pact and the tens of thousands of jobs that are associated with that managed trade ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased the hon. member has recognized what Liberal governments have done over the years to build the auto industry . 
this endorsement by the NDP will be listened to carefully by people in Windsor and other automotive cities . 
i assure the hon. member that we are looking very carefully at the interim ruling which has been received in confidence . 
we will be making our representations to the WTO with respect to what should be in any final ruling and we will act in our responsibilities as we always have to protect the interests of Canadian workers - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Richmond - Arthabaska .

intergovernmental AFFAIRS 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with things as they are in Quebec at this time , the scenario of a third referendum seems rather vague , despite the continuity of the Liberal government ' s hard line . 
now a number of people are contemplating a new type of scenario , which could comprise a referendum on the new offers Quebec might make to Canada . 
my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
is the minister going to prepare a plan A and / or plan B for this new scenario , and is he open to such an exercise originating with Quebec ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I would like to thank the Progressive Conservative intergovernmental relations critic for his question . 
i believe that when such issues are at stake , it is very important for us to limit to a minimum any disagreement between the parties that believe in Canada . 
the hon. member has certainly realized that a referendum is not necessary in order to improve Canada , to improve our highly decentralized federation . 
he has certainly realized that Quebecers , like all Canadians , do not want to be thrown into the upheaval of a referendum and he knows that , if ever there was a government that would have no credibility for this type of initiative , it is the present separatist government . 
* * * 
global POPULATION 
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past week the world welcomed its sixth billionth citizen . 
by year 2050 the world ' s population will be 8.9 billion . 
our global ecosystems and economies cannot continue to support this growing population forever . 
my question is for the Minister of International Cooperation . 
what is the government doing to help alleviate problems associated with global population ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as members know , almost all of the population growth is taking place in developing countries , aggravating the issues of poverty and social tensions in those areas . 
however , much of CIDA ' s programming is devoted to supporting women in developing countries , including their quality of life , as well as targeting funding for reproductive health programming . 
i would also like to point out that we do a great deal of work with girl child education . 
in fact , if 1,000 girls were given the opportunity to go to school for one extra year only , it would save 60 children . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , so much for another Liberal infomercial . 
the Liberal government has clearly failed to fix the broken immigration system . 
this week we learned that some of the ringleaders of the west coast people smuggling ships will not be prosecuted . 
the minister assured Canadians that people smugglers would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . 
this is an important question and hopefully a junior secretary will not get up to answer it . 
why has the government gone back on its word to prosecute these people smuggling criminals ? 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me thank the assistant critic for the Reform Party on immigration for the question . 
let me further say to to the member that our values as a government in dealing with the very serious problem of people smuggling are not the same as the Reform Party ' s values . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Transport has admitted that he is letting corporate shareholders decide the future of the Canadian airline industry . 
instead of showing leadership , he is sitting in his office waiting for Gerry Schwartz to give him a call to tell him what to do . 
this is a shameful abdication of his duty in a vital part of Canada ' s infrastructure . 
will the minister do his duty and table specific conditions for an airline merger before the Air Canada shareholders ' meeting , or is he going to wait until after the meeting when Gerry gives him a call and tells him what to do ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is true that we are waiting for the shareholders of Air Canada to pronounce upon various proposals that either come along or will come along . 
the market will decide on the corporate structuring , but the market alone will not decide on air policy for Canadians . 
the members of the House , the Senate and the government will decide what is in the public interest and what conditions have to be put on any agreement that comes forward . 
that is a way that airline policy will be guaranteed for all Canadians . 
* * * 
trucking INDUSTRY 
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , problems in the trucking industry have been in the news a lot lately . 
we know that nearly 80 % of trucking movement is interprovincial , meaning that it comes under federal jurisdiction . 
we also know that the National Transportation Act will be deregulated in January 2000 . 
my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
will he tell us what his plans are for eliminating the chaos in the trucking industry ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , how interesting that the Bloc Quebecois wants the federal government to interfere . 
what I can say is that appeals from truckers are already before the CLRB . 
we must wait for the board ' s decisions . 
* * * 
intergovernmental AFFAIRS 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs did not really answer my question . 
what we want to know is how open the government would be to any change that might come from the regions or provinces , specifically from Quebec . 
what plan A or plan B would it introduce if a region , or a province or provinces , held a referendum on major changes within the federation ? 
hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the question is too hypothetical to answer . 
all that can be said is that , with respect to the present Government of Quebec , Premier Bouchard said during the last election campaign that he was not in the business of renewing federalism . 
this statement was repeated yesterday by Quebec ' s Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . 
the Government of Quebec therefore has no credibility on this score . 
in any event , Quebecers , like all Canadians , do not want a referendum . 
i therefore expect governments to listen to Quebecers as they would listen to all Canadians . 
* * * 
justice 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a recent survey of 450 Canadian judges found that 80 % of them are so skeptical about the way conditional sentences are handled that they are leery of handing them out . 
many cited inadequate supervision for the offenders as their main concern . 
if criminals cannot be supervised , public safety cannot be assured . 
when will the justice minister change the sentencing laws to ensure that violent criminals are ineligible for conditional sentences ? 
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I have said on a number of occasions in this House , five cases were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada on this very issue some months ago . 
we are now awaiting the decision of the supreme court . 
i have made it plain that after the decision of the supreme court is rendered , if changes are required to the conditional sentencing laws in this country , they will be made . 
i am also awaiting the report of the justice committee in relation to conditional sentencing .

the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that the bill is in the same state as the previous bill , as indicated by the government House leader and , accordingly , the bill stands in the same position it would have been at the time of prorogation of the last session .

criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise on behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to introduce my private member ' s bill in the House today . 
the bill would establish a minimum two year sentence for second or subsequent convictions for the break and enter of dwelling houses . 
Canadians view the crime of break and enter as more than just a property crime . 
they view it as a crime against the person . 
it is my hope that this private member ' s bill will receive support from my colleagues so we can effectively address this national problem .

i am looking forward to strong support for this bill for the benefit of our grassroots natives who are suffering a great deal on our reserves .

witness AND SPOUSAL PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to reintroduce my private member ' s bill that I call the new identities act . 
each year in Canada hundreds of women and children live in fear for their lives . 
many women go into hiding , leaving behind their jobs , families and friends in order to cover their trail to hide from an abusive , violent spouse . 
unfortunately , many are found and beaten , and some are even killed . 
if passed , this bill will serve to formally protect those persons whose lives are in danger by bringing them into the witness protection system . 
this summer I contacted over 500 shelters and organizations across Canada for their input on this bill . 
in return I received an incredible amount of support , constructive suggestions and , most importantly , the horrific stories that necessitate this bill . 
we as parliamentarians must address the crisis of domestic violence and through the new identities program provide an escape for threatened individuals who have nowhere else to turn . 
i hope that members on all sides of the House will give this bill the non - partisan support it deserves .

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Rural Development ) ( Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario ) , Lib . ) : 
this is a very exciting time in the history of our country . 
the Speech from the Throne is the last for this millennium and lays out the government ' s vision as we move into an exciting era of the 21 st century . 
our agenda will create opportunity and prosperity for Canadians no matter where they live . 
one of every three Canadians lives outside a major centre , whether it is a small community near an urban centre or a more remote community , be it a farming town , a forestry or mining community , or one based on tourism or manufacturing . 
the government recognizes the special circumstances of rural Canadians and it specifically addressed rural Canada in its Speech from the Throne . 
Hailing as I do from a rural area of central and northern Ontario , I have seen firsthand the dynamism of our rural areas , our towns , our villages and the entrepreneurialism and energy of those who live there . 
the Speech from the Throne has clearly laid out the direction in which the government intends to go in the coming months . 
this direction applies very much to rural Canada . 
we have made a commitment to encourage the development and adaptation of new technologies , recognizing that they hold the promise of greater economic stability for rural communities traditionally dominated by single industries like mining , fishing , forestry , or agriculture . 
in other words , investments in new technologies are a critical tool in the bid to strengthen rural communities and enable them to break out of the cyclical economies . 
we will make those investments . 
the government has also committed to work with its partners in other levels of government , in the private sector , in the voluntary sector and with citizens in general to build a better quality of life for Canadians everywhere . 
as the Speech from the Throne indicated , this includes rural Canadians . 
i would like to point out that my appointment as Secretary of State for Rural Development is in itself a strong signal of the importance the government attaches to rural Canada . 
the purpose of creating a separate additional Secretary of State for Rural Development is to bolster and reinforce the government ' s focus on rural Canada . 
i am deeply honoured to serve in that position . 
in my new role I plan to lead the government ' s efforts in improving the quality of life for Canadians who live in rural and remote Canada . 
i intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of the House . 
most important , I intend to work with individual Canadians to ensure that we take a co - ordinated approach to rural Canada and that we work together for common priorities which have been identified by rural Canadians themselves . 
in the months ahead I will be concentrating on three particular areas . 
first is the rural lens . 
this is essentially a way of making sure the potential impact on rural Canada is taken into consideration before federal policy decisions are made . 
second is to help Canadians who live outside our cities have better access to all the resources that are available to them . 
that means making sure they know what programs and services are out there , as well as making sure they are able to use them . 
the third area I will be focusing on is the task of turning our strong commitments into specific tangible actions that truly help rural citizens . 
as I have said , rural Canadians face many challenges , a number of them quite similar from community to community , for example , the challenges presented by distance from markets , low population density and the cyclical nature of resource based industries . 
depending on where one lives in rural Canada , whether it is a remote Newfoundland outport , a small rural municipality in Saskatchewan , or a community in the far north , circumstances and cultures can also be quite different . 
the Government of Canada is committed to reflecting those differences and those realities in our policy decisions . 
in adopting the principle of the rural lens , cabinet has made a commitment to ensure that the challenges and priorities of rural Canadians are understood and taken into account , both in current initiatives and in long term planning . 
as Secretary of State for Rural Development , I look forward to the opportunity to work with my cabinet colleagues in applying the rural lens . 
this brings me back to my second priority which is to improve the communications and information flow between the government and rural citizens . 
as well as sharpening our focus on rural concerns within the government , it is also critically important that we do more to let rural Canadians know what assistance or programming is already available . 
we have made a good start . 
one key way of doing this is by producing an annual report which measures our achievements in dealing with rural issues and challenges . 
not only is the government committed to helping rural Canadians , it also expects to be held accountable for doing so . 
early next year I will table this report in parliament , thereby providing an opportunity both for my colleagues in the House of Commons and for all Canadians to engage in a public discussion on how we chart the future of rural Canada . 
developing rural Canada and assisting rural Canadians will be a transparent process , one that is bottom up and not top down driven . 
more than that it will be an opportunity to discuss our successes , our challenges , our vision , and most important the specific actions we need to take to ensure the future of rural Canada . 
the third area I want to talk about and the most important part of what I am charged to do relates to specific actions to be taken to bring about tangible developments and improvements for rural Canadians . 
the direction set out in the Speech from the Throne will guide us as we work to deliver the results in rural Canada . 
our focus must now shift from process to results to take the steps necessary to develop action items into specific deliverables in rural Canada and make concrete progress on the priorities of rural Canadians . 
in some cases this may simply mean bringing together different departments that do similar programs to focus resources in one area . 
in other cases we may need something new in addition to what is already being undertaken . 
for example , Health Canada through the office of rural health is taking the lead on the development of a rural health strategy to ensure that Canadians in rural and remote areas have access to quality health care . 
in another initiative a number of service Canada projects are being tried out in rural areas as a possible way to improve access to government programs and services . 
before closing I would like to mention that I wear another hat , that of Secretary of State for Federal Economic Development Initiative in Northern Ontario , more commonly known as the FedNor program . 
that brings with it a responsibility for community futures which plays a role in providing access to capital and facilitating business development for rural Canadians . 
the community futures development corporations are administered by four different entities within the federal government : three regional development agencies , plus Industry Canada . 
the program works very well . 
it is an excellent example of one community level program which works across several different agencies , yet is very rurally focused . 
over the next few weeks I will be discussing with my ministerial colleagues other co - operative initiatives that involve their departments or agencies . 
those initiatives will be directly targeted at the priorities set forward in the Speech from the Throne , and the federal framework for action in rural Canada which rural Canadians themselves helped to write and helped to develop . 
the Speech from the Throne lays out a vision and opportunity for prosperity for Canadians . 
it is my personal commitment to ensure that rural Canadians are equal partners in that vision , that they have the technologies , the tools and the infrastructure to build a better quality of life for their chosen communities . 
rural Canada is the foundation on which a large part of our economic wealth is built . 
it is a place of great energy and great ingenuity . 
it is our past , it is our present and it is our future . 
it is a way of life , a way of unique traditions and a specific social structure . 
most important , rural Canada is home . 
it is home to my family and other members ' families . 
this government is working to make sure that that future for rural Canadians is as bright as possible . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , my question for the minister is a very simple one . 
he speaks of the nine million Canadians who live in rural Canada . 
i think he has tried very gallantly to revise the biggest single omission in the throne speech and that is the fact that there was no mention of agriculture . 
the AIDA and NISA programs simply do not meet their needs . 
some of those programs are based on 70 % of the last three years ' earnings . 
in my riding the last three years have been disastrous due to the drought . 
of course , 70 % of nothing is nothing . 
for farmers who are facing this crisis and bankruptcy there was absolutely nothing in the throne speech . 
the minister speaks about rural issues . 
one of the most pivotal and important issues for rural Canadians is agriculture and food output . 
the throne speech did not address that . 
that is a significant concern . 
the minister does not address that . 
the minister spoke at length about e - commerce , the growth in the high tech sector and the importance of connectedness in terms of technology in rural communities . 
i share with him in his optimism that in the long term these may play a role . 
however , does he really believe that the government ' s focus on e - commerce and on Internet connectedness for rural communities is going to help ? 
does he really believe in the short term that a 50 year old farmer who is facing bankruptcy is going to be turned into a computer programmer or a high tech worker and suddenly will be transported back from the edge of the abyss of poverty , despair and into some new e - world of prosperity and future potential ? 
i believe he is being very naive and that the government is being very cold - hearted in turning its back on rural Canada and particularly on the agricultural sector , both in the west , in Ontario and in the east . 
hon. Andy Mitchell : 
madam Speaker , part of what we see here , from the comments made by the hon. member who represents the Tory Party , is a good example of how its inability to deal with two separate issues at the same time led to an administration in the country from 1984 to 1993 that resulted in record deficits , increased unemployment and lower economic growth . 
the reality is that we are dealing with all the issues that the hon. member mentioned . 
he talked about nothing being done in terms of the farm income prices . 
that work is ongoing and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food has indicated his willingness to continue to work with his provincial counterparts , with the industry and with others to do the things that are necessary to help . 
beyond just simply helping in the income crisis , as important as that is , we must also ensure the long term viability of rural Canada . 
we cannot just simply deal with the issues of the day , although we must and it is important . 
we must also ensure the long term viability of rural Canada and rural Canadians . 
we must make sure that there is a future for rural Canadians . 
we must make sure there is a future for our children so that they can choose to live in rural Canada . 
it means more than simply identifying or dealing with one specific industry . 
it means more than just simply identifying with any one specific problem . 
it means dealing with the broad issues that face rural Canadians . 
it means understanding that rural Canada has separate challenges and separate needs and to respond to them . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
i would invite him to speak to the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
with his responsibility for rural areas he is surely aware that , since employment insurance reform , there has been a serious problem that has to do with the rule of intensity . 
yesterday , the Minister of Human Resources Development gave an interview to a Moncton newspaper . 
she thinks that the rule of intensity must not be done away with , nor the period of benefits extended , because that is no solution . 
more employment must be created , and seasonal employment must be enabled to last longer . 
i say to the secretary of state and to the minister " Why not do both at the same time ? " 
when they state that the industry ' s season must be lengthened , it is as if they were telling people " You are not working longer because you do not want to . " 
the Secretary of State for Rural Development must surely know , and I hope he agrees with that view , that there is no one in Canada who does not want to work . 
this is not a situation where , contrary to what the Prime Minister said in the past , the unemployed are beer drinkers . 
that has been demonstrated . 
there are no more cheaters among the unemployed than there are in multinationals or elsewhere . 
generally speaking , people do want to work . 
it is not by hitting them on the head or by imposing unacceptable rules regarding minimum income that things will change . 
in rural areas , when a person works 15 or 20 weeks , if that person does not collect enough benefits , even if he or she has a job , even if he or she is among those who worked during the year , that person will still get poor because we do not have a good employment insurance program . 
so , will the Secretary of State for Rural Development make representations to the Minister of Human Resources Development to have that situation changed , and is he not deeply upset that the throne speech says nothing on this issue ? 
will the secretary of state do that in the years to come ? 
hon. Andy Mitchell : 
madam Speaker , I had the opportunity as the chair of the natural resources committee to author a report called " Think Rural " which outlined many of the issues in rural Canada . 
even though the hon. member was not a member of that committee , he took the time , effort and energy to provide input into the development of that report . 
he is committed to his rural area . 
in terms of the issues in HRDC , I know that he and the minister have had debates in the House and that they continue to have discussions . 
the member forgets to talk about the other parts of the HRDC regime . 
he forgets to talk about active measures and all the other labour market adjustment type of initiatives that are undertaken by HRDC and which certainly help rural areas . 
i had the opportunity not too long ago to travel to his part of the country . 
there was a concern about improving the quality of life of rural Canadians no matter where they live . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I , like some of my other colleagues , will begin by pointing out to Canadians and to the members of the House an issue that was not addressed in the Speech from the Throne : the state of Canada ' s airline industry . 
we were all inundated over the summer months with positions both for and against changes in the airline industry but the government remains silent . 
there was absolutely no mention in the throne speech of the crisis in the airline industry . 
it is very clear that major changes will be coming . 
these are the questions I have . 
where is the government ' s vision for the future of the Canadian airline industry ? 
where does the government feel Canadians want to see the airline industry go ? 
it is the government ' s apparent lack of vision that causes concern . 
the government seems to always be responding or reacting to situations rather than working out some of the problems or finding solutions in advance . 
unfortunately its history of popping up into the issues and trying to influence the private sector is usually done for the wrong reasons . 
once the dust settles over the current airline industry situation , government and parliament must work together in a non - partisan fashion . 
we must work together with the stakeholders to develop a clear blueprint for Canada ' s airline industry in the 21 st century . 
i do not think there is a Canadian who has not heard of Onex , Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International . 
Canadians accept the fact that Canadian Airlines International is in trouble . 
i think everyone is aware of the Onex offer to merge the two airlines to stabilize Canada ' s airline industry under one major airline . 
i do not think there are many Canadians , and I am one of them , who are aware of what Air Canada ' s counterproposal may be . 
however , I would suggest that one way or another it looks like we will only have one national airline in Canada . 
more importantly , parliament must play a role and it must be done in a non - partisan fashion . 
the Reform Party believes that the role of government should be to facilitate a private enterprise solution to this problem . 
that means less government regulation not more . 
it means that the government must establish the priority of protecting the interests of Canadian consumers at both the national and regional levels , the interests of the Canadian taxpayer , the interests of the airline employees and the interests of those who invest in Canada ' s airline industry . 
maybe a starting point would be a comparison with the airline industry in Australia . 
it is interesting that in Australia where the demographics and the geography is very similar to Canada and where it has similar concerns and issues that Australia can have two profitable national airlines . 
maybe there is something that we can learn from Australia ' s airline industry . 
we also have to look at what role this government and previous Liberal and Conservative governments played in bringing our airline industry to the point where it is today . 
more importantly , the issue we have to address is how to fix the problem . 
i will move on from the airline industry because there are other transportation issues in the country that must be addressed . 
canada is on the brink of entering a new century . 
the brief mention of infrastructure programs in the throne speech leaves a lot of questions in the air . 
it mentions that the federal government will work with the provinces and the private sector over the next year to develop a new five year plan for improving the infrastructure . 
i think that is very short sighted of the government and of our country . 
we have to take a much larger and longer vision of where we want to go with our infrastructure and on how we are going to get there . 
we would be remiss if we were not looking in ten 20 - year cycles as opposed to only looking five years down the road . 
not only is that true for our infrastructure program but it is also true for our national highway system . 
government has studied the problem of Canada ' s highway system for years . 
it really is time to quit studying and to do something about it . 
it is important for rural Canada , it is important for urban Canada and it is important for the well being of all Canadians that our transportation networks are sound , well planned and certainly in good condition . 
one of the issues that is very dear to my heart is the issue of trade corridors . 
a large part of the reason for Canada ' s economic improvement over the last years is due to the massive increase in trade , mainly with the Americans . 
i do not know that Canadians understand or realize that over $ 1.5 billion worth of trade happens across the Canada - U.S. border every single day of the year . 
it is not just good enough to have trade agreements . 
it is not just good enough to have agreements among countries and documents that are signed between the leaders . 
we have to be able to move the goods that we have agreed to trade . 
we have to make sure that the movement of those goods is done in an efficient and timely manner . 
i do not think we can ignore rail transportation , particularly the movement of grain across our country . 
that has been an issue for a number years and it remains an issue that has to be resolved . 
two reports have been produced for parliament to consider , the Estey and Kroeger reports . 
i look forward to the coming years and seeing this happen . 
there are also environmental concerns . 
if the Minister of Environment is concerned about vehicle emissions then I would suggest that he go to any major commercial border crossing . 
it is time to address some of these issues . 
more important , the government ' s plan of talking with the provinces about highways is not just good enough . 
we need to develop a seamless transportation system involving our highways , our railways , our waterways and skies to move goods and people in the most efficient manner not on a national basis but on a continental - wide basis . 
only then can we ensure that we are looking after the health , safety and economic well - being of all Canadians . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
they are few and far between , but it highlighted the ones it thought were important . 
there was nothing in the speech but a reiteration of the fact that the government was putting $ 11.5 billion into health care over the next several years . 
that is totally insufficient . 
they would like to have seen something in that regard . 
also the government seems to have recognized that it has been fumbling the first nations accountability issue . 
the throne speech mentioned that the government wanted to foster accountability on the part of elected officials on our first nations . 
the Indian affairs minister has said in speeches privately in Saskatchewan that was one of the government ' s objectives . 
it is certainly worth recognizing that . 
physical infrastructure work was mentioned with regard to what I assume will be roads . 
this may have a benefit for farmers if the physical infrastructure it is talking about enables roads to be built sufficient to carry the large trucks which are now necessary to carry grain from the farmers field to the inland terminals and out to port by rail . 
a couple of points in the throne speech were scary for farmers . 
certainly we are concerned about the government ' s intentions with regard to its Kyoto commitment and how they will impact upon the government . 
the government is in the process of closing that research station . 
in fact it has virtually closed it now . 
what it is leaving behind can only be described as waste and byproducts . 
the nuclear contamination from that site is still there . 
that is a natural issue which happens . 
the mayor of Pinawa , the town in which it is located , and the Hon. Darren Praznik , MLA for that area , have clearly brought to my attention that they need assistance to bring to the attention of the government in Ottawa that this nuclear contamination and the clean up of the Whiteshell site are of utmost importance . 
we will make sure that it is raised and something is done about it . 
i will point out one last thing about it . 
when hot cells , nuclear contaminated cells , in Tunney ' s Pasture in Ottawa were decommissioned a couple of years ago , they were completely demolished and the site was returned to a green field state . 
why should Manitobans and the people of Selkirk - Interlake and Provencher expect anything less than what was done in Ontario ? 
as the chief agriculture critic I will devote the rest of my speech to agriculture issues . 
our leader has spoken quite eloquently with regard to the lack of emphasis on agriculture in the throne speech . 
for the last two years farmers across Canada have faced destructive drops in farm income . 
Saskatchewan farmers are so desperate that they are actually involved right now in a tax revolt involving the education taxes on their properties . 
we are finding that these farmers are being pushed into doing anything they can do to reduce the cost of government in particular and other costs that are helping to drive them out of business . 
i will use the gross figures for Manitoba . 
we talk about a realized net farm income drop in Manitoba to $ 64 million according to Statistics Canada figures . 
these figures are not something I made up myself . 
they are right from Statistics Canada . 
that drop to $ 64 million is $ 100 million below the $ 164 million earned by Manitoba farmers in 1998 and well below the five year average of $ 231 million . 
the program the government brought forward to address the income crisis was AIDA , the agricultural income disaster assistance program . 
the government had the understanding or misunderstanding , really , that the situation with regard to farm incomes was simply a one year drop in income in 1998 but that the drastic drop may happen in 1999 also . 
the government took the program that came to it from the safety net advisory committee , which involves a lot of farmers ' groups , et cetera . 
the government changed that recommendation around to make the program fit the budget the minister thought he could get for it , instead of making the program fit the crisis and address the problem . 
that is exactly why AIDA has not worked . 
i will just give a couple of examples of farmers who were applying for AIDA and receiving nothing . 
one story is that in May of this year two brothers who are farmers in Manitoba applied . 
their application is still sitting in the review area of AIDA . 
the way the farm is set up , they expect to get approximately $ 70,000 back from AIDA . 
they have received nothing and they are on the verge of going bankrupt . 
over past months , certainly since last fall in particular and in fact right from 1993 , the Reform Party has made many suggestions to the government on how it can increase the income of farmers . 
as a result , I would only suggest that the government review all the material we in the Reform have produced , take those suggestions and implement them immediately to help solve the crisis in western Canada and across the country . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
i would like to ask my hon. colleague to comment on a couple of points . 
first , we lost the benefit of the Crow rate under the Liberal government . 
it seems to me the Crow rate agreement was also an agreement in perpetuity , but the government just said with impunity that it would wipe it out and give them a bit of a cash payment which hopefully would cover it . 
could the member comment on to what degree the cash payment came even close to covering the long term costs of farmers transporting their grain to the ports ? 
my second question is with regard to transportation problems . 
when I was a youngster my dad used to ask " How come when I buy a combine or a tractor that is manufactured in Ontario I have to pay the freight to get it from Ontario to Saskatchewan , but when I sell them my wheat I have to pay the freight to send their wheat back to Ontario ? " 
i would like the member to comment on those two points . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
that Liberal promise along with the promise of the Conservatives over the years assured western Canadian farmers that the Crow rate , which was a subsidy for exporting grain , would be kept in perpetuity . 
western Canadian farmers certainly knew better than the Liberal and Conservative governments . 
the real devastation regarding the income problem and the cash taken out of farmers ' pockets when the subsidy was not received anymore was that starting in 1993 with the trade agreement and in 1995 with the federal budget , domestic support for agriculture was drastically reduced by the government in an attempt to balance its deficit . 
in doing so it brought in user fees and all kinds of charges , increased taxes and all of the things that have taken away the meagre incomes farmers were getting from exporting their grain . 
what do we see ? 
nothing is happening by way of money for the majority of farmers in western Canada in particular , and in Ontario , to keep them on the farm and keep the farms going . 
what will happen ? 
it will end up that this country ' s farmland will be owned by absentee landlords . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , Peace River country has had a double whammy . 
it has had a series of very wet years that have caused farmers to have a low three year margin net income . 
the government put together an AIDA program that said it would base payments on a three year margin net income . 
guess what ? 
it was so low that farmers do not have the income to get a payout . 
that is why they are failing again to pay - 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
we have to resume debate . 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to represent Vancouver Kingsway and take part in today ' s debate . 
i am splitting my time with the hon. member for St. Paul ' s . 
we are entering the century of the Pacific . 
it is very fitting , as the Prime Minister has noted , that a Canadian who came to the country as a young refugee from China should be the new Governor General . 
that an individual who arrived in Canada as a refugee can attain the position of Governor General , a post deeply rooted in our tradition , is a symbol to the world . 
it is a very special appointment and symbol that Canada affords to all citizens the opportunity to participate fully in our society . 
it is a symbol that all citizens , whether born on Canadian soil or having arrived as migrants from other nations , can and do make meaningful contributions . 
it is a symbol that Canada is a nation that recognizes talent and diversity . 
indeed over the last century our society has blossomed with migrants from the four corners of the globe arriving and contributing . 
the appointment of the Governor General is a true reflection and celebration of cultural diversity in Canada today . 
i would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on this important appointment . 
that such an appointment has been made under this government demonstrates its recognition and appreciation of the rich and beautiful cultural fibre that our nation has . 
that so many aspects of this country are flourishing is a credit to our Liberal government , but we must continue to build on our strengths . 
we must strive to increase the quality of life of all Canadians . 
children are at the forefront of our investment in the future . 
this government is committed to ensuring that children receive the support and attention they need . 
many studies demonstrate that the early years of a child ' s life are very important . 
loving and involved parents are the cornerstone of the well - being , happiness and success of every child . 
the government is to be commended on its solid commitment to extend employment insurance maternity benefits and parental leave . 
maternal leave time will be extended from a current maximum to a full year , a year that will provide invaluable time for all our children . 
the government has shown its insight in providing new benefits to accommodate the diverse needs of Canadian families . 
those benefits will be more flexible , more adaptable to the wide range of realities that face Canadian families . 
this government wants to ensure that children are equipped with all the capacities they need to be ready to learn when they begin school and to grow into healthy productive adults . 
as a government , as responsible citizens , we have no higher priority than our children . 
as our children grow they must be well educated in good schools and institutions that will provide them with skills that will prepare them for work and future challenges , that will prepare them to be successful in a global economy . 
that is why the investment this government has announced for our post - secondary institutions is so crucial . 
in the Prime Minister ' s address , he endorsed a plan to create 1,200 new chairs for research excellence in universities across Canada and more important , a plan for the financial support needed to make them internationally competitive . 
that was not an empty commitment : $ 60 million in the first year of the plan ; $ 122 million in the second year ; $ 180 million in the third year ; and following that , a further $ 120 million will fund 800 additional chairs . 
canada needs those university chair endowments to compete for , to attract and to retain researchers of international calibre . 
furthermore , those researchers will train our students to become the best and the brightest in the world . 
such investment in post - secondary institutions ensures Canadians will have the resources and expertise to be successful in a highly competitive world . 
those endowments will ensure Canada is at the forefront of the knowledge based economy . 
the Canada Foundation for Innovation has already been created . 
that $ 1 billion endowment is helping to build a leading edge national system of innovation . 
knowledge and technological innovation are the cornerstones of a higher standard of living and a better quality of life . 
in January the Canadian millennium scholarship fund will begin to generate over 10,000 scholarships . 
the government ' s SchoolNet project has connected every public school and library in Canada . 
the community access program will have public Internet sites in 10,000 rural and urban communities before the end of this year . 
the government has and will continue to increase support for lifelong learning to ensure Canada has the most highly skilled and knowledgeable workforce in the world . 
the previous commitments of the government and those outlined in the Speech from the Throne indicate the level of commitment this government has to ensure Canadians will embrace the challenges of the 21 st century . 
this investment in education and research will fuel the Canadian economy of the next century . 
our economy will continue to strive and to grow . 
Canadian families will benefit . 
continued tax reduction will foster an even more dynamic economy . 
the next budget will lay out a multi - year plan for further tax reduction . 
i am a member of the finance committee and we will be conducting prebudget public hearings to listen to Canadians for their ideas and suggestions for our next budget . 
we are one of the leading industrialized nations in the world . 
the future will see great advances in business , government and society . 
the way to the 21 st century is to invest in the cornerstones of our society . 
we will invest in our children , in our families , in our researchers and in our educational system . 
let us be clear . 
what this government will not do is sacrifice our financial health . 
Canadians from British Columbia and indeed from coast to coast to coast recognize this is the direction for Canada in the next century . 
the government is doing what Canadians want . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member . 
she said that the 21 st century would belong to the Pacific region . 
will the hon. member be able to influence her government colleagues , so that they take a stand regarding the labeling of genetically modified products ? 
may be the hon. member can influence her colleagues . 
i would like to hear her comments on this issue . 
Ms. Sophia Leung : 
madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for her very thoughtful question . 
it would be very interesting for our government to consider and I think a lot of study will follow . 
in the meantime , very strict regulations will be set up . 
i thank her for calling this matter to our attention . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened to the hon. member ' s speech with great interest . 
she outlined a whole raft of them in her speech for which they are going to need taxpayers ' money . 
certainly , something like that we can all agree with . 
however , I wonder when she and her Liberal colleagues will get it through their heads that the easiest way to improve the quality of life for Canadians is to lift the oppressive tax burden which they face . 
i do not want to hear the hon. member insult Canadians ' intelligence by talking about $ 16.5 billion in tax cuts . 
i want the hon. member to answer very honestly and truthfully - and do not insult the intelligence of the Canadians voters who are watching this debate today - when her government is going to deliver real tax relief , not this bogus $ 16.5 billion they always talk about . 
Ms. Sophia Leung : 
madam Speaker , I would like to remind my colleague that we very successfully eliminated the $ 42 billion deficit . 
it is on the record . 
now we are entering an era where we will have a balanced approach . 
there will be tax cuts , but at the same time we will not overlook the most important things , such as health care , social programs and the children ' s agenda . 
we are now spending under a very cautious , socially balanced program . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , the hon. member speaks again of investment , which is really spending , but the fact is that many Canadians are finding it difficult to invest themselves . 
while the government is currently in the black , at an unprecedented rate Canadians are in the red . 
we have the highest level of personal debt in the history of our country . 
in the 1990 s Canadians have seen an 8 % drop in their personal disposable income because of the tax burden imposed by this government . 
during the same period Americans have enjoyed a 10 % increase . 
would it not be better if Canadians were able to invest for their own futures as opposed to the government taking more money from Canadians and then trying to invest where it feels the priorities are ? 
Ms. Sophia Leung : 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to rise today to reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
building a higher quality of life for all Canadians is an ideal theme , as we are about to celebrate the new millennium . 
it is the greatest legacy that we can leave to Canadians . 
it is about vision . 
it is about what kind of country we want to live in . 
it demonstrates a real understanding of the broadest determinants of quality of life . 
it recognizes that although we have been designated the best country in the world in which to live we cannot rest on our laurels . 
vision is statesman - like foresight , sagacity in planning . 
it means using our experience and our knowledge together with the power to apply them critically and practically . 
no longer is it possible for Canadians to think that good social policy is bad economic policy . 
we are now embarking on a new age where with good social science research we can demonstrate that good social policy is excellent economic policy and those who think that tax cuts alone will cure all are horribly misguided . 
the tax cuts in Ontario resulted in the doubling of child poverty . 
we are embarrassed internationally because of this . 
the cuts to social services in Ontario have not saved money . 
Gina Browne , the fabulous researcher at McMaster and author of When the Bough Breaks , has now demonstrated that conclusively , with the help of Health Canada . 
the Ministry of Health of Ontario has turned down the study twice and now seems to be hiding from its results . 
i would like to outline some of the highlights of the study to show that the failure to provide appropriate social programs does not save a cent because the people go elsewhere , generally to the medical system , and cost at least as much money there . 
Gina took over 700 single moms . 
some were left to self - direct their support generally by using walk - in clinics , emergency departments and GPs ' offices . 
some were directed to a variety of support : recreation , day care , social services and employment advice . 
at the end of two years the control group had 10 % less on welfare generally because the Harris program had cut them off . 
the kids now had friends from other neighbourhoods and were well on their way . 
in the group that received all the support , over 25 % had exited the welfare system and demonstrated huge savings in their use of the medical system . 
the interventions helped to identify the mothers with depression and got them appropriate and effective help . 
as Gina has said to rotary club after rotary club , the Government of Ontario is kidding itself if it thinks it is saving money by its cuts . 
what is exciting now is that we can fund research to show what instinctively we have known , that good social policy is good economic policy . 
with the social union framework we have an exciting tool with which we as a country can begin to share best practices and demonstrate that accountability and transparency are what Canadians need in order to feel that their taxes are well spent . 
the commitment in the social union for all levels of government to report publicly on the effectiveness of their social programs in effect will continue to demonstrate this reality of good social programs being good economic policy . 
the Speech from the Throne articulated the commitment of the Government of Canada to work toward removing all barriers for the mobility of Canadians with respect to their qualifications , student loans and essential services for persons with disabilities . 
it is clear that achieving full citizenship for all Canadians is good social policy as well as good economic policy . 
the people of St. Paul ' s are big picture people . 
they understand the need for balance and accountability . 
they understand that we need evidence based practice . 
i believe the Speech from the Throne has touched the core values of Canadians . 
as my constituent Fiona Nelson pointed out , the big cold countries at the top of the globe decided a long time ago that we would have to look after one another . 
the countries in the middle with the warm climate , fishing and coconuts falling out of the trees have not had to be quite so progressive . 
Canadians decided a long time ago that they do not want people to have to mortgage their homes , and maybe even lose them , for their cobalt treatment for cancer . 
the final report of the National Forum on Health eloquently articulated that the core Canadian values will remain even when opinions can waver or be seduced by the rhetoric of more money in people ' s pockets solving everything . 
Canadians want fairness . 
they want the tax system to be made fairer . 
they know that increasing disposable income for the lower and middle classes is a good thing . 
they understand that the child tax benefit has been an extremely important measure for the working poor , and that extending it to the middle class will be extremely important to their children . 
last year at the prebudget consultations in St. Paul ' s some of the business people expressed their concern about the use of the word " investment " as the new code for government spending . 
whether we call it smart spending , results based management or investment , it is becoming clearer and clearer that we can spend a little now or a lot more later . 
the Minister of Labour , who is responsible for homelessness , has declared many times that investing in kids now will help us to close prisons later and that this is now becoming better understood . 
there are certain expenditures that , with a proper long range view , we cannot afford not to do . 
governments can no longer present a little checklist of things that can be accomplished within their mandate . 
as we look to the millennium it is imperative that we look forward to our future . 
we need to do the right thing now . 
it will be our legacy . 
if 25 % of absenteeism in children is because of a tragic increase in asthma , we must do something about air quality now . 
we must help the world deal with all aspects of the sustainability of our planet . 
the vision articulated in the Speech from the Throne was a broad vision for Canada . 
its focus on children as we move to a knowledge based economy is one of the best things we can be doing . 
Dr. Fraser Mustard said that there is substantial evidence that the quality of early childhood experience has long term effects on an individual ' s performance in the education system , their behaviour in adult life and their risk for chronic disease in adult life . 
we know that this need is universal and that in many neighbourhoods the wealthy children are not doing any better because love is not the same thing as knowing how to parent . 
i had the privilege of practising next to the fabulous Children ' s Storefront in Toronto where I watched parents , nannies and new immigrants come . 
with the advice of the early childhood educators they learned about conflict resolution , positive reinforcement , attitudes toward learning , cuddling and reading . 
i know that it works . 
i know that those children are better off . 
as we embark on the exciting new research chairs and the Canadian institutes of health research we have an opportunity to gain better evidence as we do research in evaluating the policies and programs to find the optimal solutions . 
if we look at the commitment to aboriginal health alone , we know that we have to do something about the doubled rate of low birth rate babies , five times the suicide rate and six times the death rate from injuries , violence and poisoning . 
we need to look at the root causes of homelessness , the role of de - institutionalization , child abuse , substance abuse , learning disabilities and FAE / FAS . 
this is an extraordinary time for Canada . 
the prospect of a surplus will ensure our ability to be able to deliver a truly balanced approach . 
this is a truly Canadian thing to do . 
we want to build a stronger Canada and provide a better quality of life to our children and grandchildren . 
this is the best legacy that we can leave to them . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to direct two questions to the hon. member . 
the previous speaker talked a great deal about the importance of education , with which I agree . 
being well educated people , our young people look forward to a good future in this country . 
i am acquainted with many highly educated people from this land . 
in fact , one of them is my son , who went into a certain field , searched around and is now working in Georgia along with thousands of other Canadians who have left this country . 
doing the same job down there , as compared to here , he puts $ 500 to $ 600 each month more into his pocket , savings because of taxes . 
he is on a very good health program . 
he has benefits that exceed any that we provide to many of our employees in this land . 
yet his heart is in Canada . 
he wants to be here , as do many of them , but because of economics and of high taxes they cannot afford not to take jobs south of the border with greater benefits , greater wages and lower taxes . 
when will the government recognize that quality of life does not exist here ? 
it is fading away . 
on quality of life the solicitor general , the justice minister and many of the people in the justice area have indicated that we need to empty our prisons , that we have too many people in jail . 
this month a multiple killer , a cop killer , walked away from a minimum security prison . 
there has been a 100 % increase in people walking away from prison . 
it all adds up to the total incompetence of a justice system which would allow this kind of person to walk away from a penitentiary . 
the government ' s policies are allowing it . 
it is worse today than it ever was . 
could the hon. member address these two issues ? 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett : 
madam Speaker , I remind the hon. member that most of the people moving to the United States are moving because of opportunities . 
in terms of salaries that are offered there , for example , there is the fabulous Howard Hughes grant of $ 1 million a year to a researcher . 
we have trouble competing with that . 
there is no good evidence that these people are moving purely because of taxes . 
it is opportunity . 
when my patients moved to New York and had to spend $ 10,000 a year on their health insurance they understood what comes with the taxes in our country and a reliance on a public health care system , a fabulous public education system and a huge reduction in crime . 
people do not want to live in armed communities . 
the kind of approach demonstrated in the Speech from the Throne will actually prevent the cop killers the hon. member talks about . 
we will actually be able to demonstrate that we have much smaller numbers of people who require being in prison 20 years from now if we do the right thing now . 
it is not that we want more cops and more prisons . 
that is not an approach to crime . 
we have to deal with people who were abused as children , who have fetal alcohol effects , who have learning disabilities that were not recognized and then ran into trouble in the school system , dropped out , got into trouble with drugs and then later into trouble with the justice system . 
this is a prevention problem . 
this has nothing to do with what the hon. member suggests is crime and punishment . 
it just does not work . 
we know it does not work . 
we have to prevent psychopaths before they are formed . 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , let me say from the outset that the reason I want to take part in this debate about the throne speech is to stress how this government - which has major surpluses after cuts in transfers to the provinces , with the result that ordinary people in particular have felt the impact of these significant cuts in health , education and social assistance - is using these surpluses in an arrogant way , without any concern for the very real problems experienced by individuals , problems for which the provinces now appear to be responsible . 
first , why did the government postpone the beginning of the session by three weeks ? 
did the throne speech really justify that three week delay ? 
during those three weeks , Quebecers and Canadians could not get answers from federal ministers , nor could these ministers be pressured into finding solutions to issues such as the major problem in the airline industry . 
in Montreal , between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs could be lost , yet no one was there to explain why the government was letting things develop in such fashion or , if there is an east - west problem in Canada , to let us at least talk openly about it . 
why was the speech postponed ? 
citizens were deprived of an opportunity to react in a timely manner to the supreme court decision . 
the government saw the Marshall decision coming ; it should have been ready . 
who paid the price ? 
i would like to point out that Acadians and natives were on good terms . 
many times , Acadians would say , in French , that they were sad because the reason many people were still around was because the Indians had protected them after the 1755 deportation . 
why a three week delay ? 
here is what I think . 
first , the government wanted to install , with great pomp , a new couple to represent the Queen of England , the Queen of Canada . 
the government claims it wants to help Canada enter the 21 st century as a leader . 
in the meantime , what are the Australians doing ? 
they are getting ready for a referendum on whether or not to become a republic . 
that is a debate that might perhaps lead to the 21 st century . 
the decisive day is November 6 . 
how wrong it was , because that was not what came out of the forum . 
by the way , I would like my constituents in Mercier to know that I was there and glad that I was . 
what we saw were federations that said they were having problems and were trying to resolve them . 
that is not what we see in Canada . 
did the Canadians tell the forum that they were having problems , that they had imposed the Constitution on Quebec in 1982 , and that it could no longer be changed , when change was what was needed ? 
no , we did not hear that . 
canada appeared as the model of a federation , but nobody was fooled , because Lucien Bouchard and Joseph Facal set out the problems . 
they said what we are saying in the House of Commons . 
the conference revealed more than just the problems that Canada did not want to reveal . 
it also established that the issue of identity was important one . 
the speaker everyone there acknowledged as the best spoke of the importance of identity . 
other federations said that they were trying to satisfy the needs of groups , specifically , the federations based on two or three nations trying to accommodate them so that together they may improve the quality of life of their citizens . 
i could not ignore the fact either that the first person to point out that Canadian federalism had huge problems , was Ghislain Picard , who noted just how often native peoples had promises made to them put off . 
for Quebec , this is a throne speech of a unitarian country recognizing increasingly less its mere existence . 
the word is mentioned once to say that the government will be concerned with the issue of clarity , as if 94 % of Quebecers who voted the last time did not know that their question was clear . 
even Jean Chr é tien realized it . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde : 
we have the Speech from the Throne . 
the mentality in it is the same as at the international conference on federalism . 
canada is denying the problems . 
the Government of Canada is skirting the problems it itself created with the dramatic cuts to transfer payments . 
the government arrives and talks to us about the 21 st century , applauded by the Liberal crowd . 
and what does it announce ? 
does it announce help for the provinces in resolving their problems ? 
No. It introduces new programs . 
will it help the unemployed live during the time it takes them to find a new job ? 
the terrible thing in this is that many people need money . 
these people find themselves in a situation created to a large extent by the federal cuts . 
they do not necessarily understand exactly how they ended up in that situation , because those who made the cuts and reduced services are those who manage the programs , that is the provincial governments . 
nonetheless , the federal government will introduce new benefits for children , for example . 
if children are poor , it is because their families are poor . 
we saw the situation of the families deteriorate , and that is the most serious problem at the moment . 
i know that 1,200 new chairs were announced . 
i can talk about that because I was member of the industry committee . 
the main problem in postsecondary education comes from the context in which universities must operate . 
the creation of new chairs will not solve the problem . 
of course , universities will gladly accept the money , but they are in dire need , like the hospitals . 
if the government had had a real vision - and everybody will reach the new millennium at the same time , like Christmas and New Year Day - it would have started by working on the problems it created itself , to avoid becoming an outdated government , one that is out of touch , in spite of its desire to appear to be the best wired government in the world . 
Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , ten minutes is a short time for a lot of people in this parliament , but especially for the member for Mercier who , obviously , had a lot more to say . 
i would also like her to comment on the following : this morning , in a newspaper , there was an article about maternity leave . 
i was struck by the title of this article written by Jean - Jacques Samson , from Quebec City , with whom I do not always agree , but who really did put his finger on the problem . 
he pointed out that the federal government wants to show some generosity by extending maternity leave without changing UI eligibility rules but , at the same time , that we must not forget that it no longer contributes to the UI fund . 
only employers and employees contribute to the fund . 
is the federal government not doing the same thing it did to the provinces , namely cutting transfer payments and using all kinds of schemes to look generous , trying to impress Canadians with other people ' s money ? 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde : 
this reaction from a well - known Quebec journalist is sound and I was recently getting to the same conclusion although in a different way . 
let us take for example the issue of maternity leave . 
i can tell you that most of those who phoned my constituency office had the simple reaction to say that the unemployment benefits are so low that instead of having a full year off , they would much rather have a shorter leave and get real benefits that would equal to much more than 55 % of their salary . 
we all know that working women often do not earn much more than minimum wage . 
they also often do not work many hours , which means that they earn very little money . 
consequently , even if we allow those low - income women to take a whole year off , if they do not have a spouse with a good salary , they will not be able to take advantage of it . 
it is a very simple way of answering to the government , by looking at ordinary people ' s reaction . 
if the government was really taking their problems into account instead of only reacting to the plans that the government of Quebec advanced and that it has a hard time to implement because of the lack of co - operation from the federal government , the government would grant real maternity leave . 
real maternity leave is not one that only a few women can take advantage of . 
it certainly does not generate enough income , even if it is extended . 
there is a lot more to say about this Speech from the throne and the generous gifts that it contains , without taking into account the real situations and the problems that the government itself is responsible for . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to take part in this debate on the throne speech because three weeks ago the members of the Bloc who are in charge of social issues have stated that social equity should be the motto of this throne speech . 
when I consider this speech , I have to wonder if the government has really tried to uphold the principle of social equity . 
it certainly has not found the right means to do it . 
it should also use the EI plan to make sure workers get a decent income when they are out of work . 
but its responsibility is not to create first line services . 
that is not its turf . 
it has never succeeded in doing it efficiently and concretely , and it is not its constitutional responsibility to do it . 
the first mistake of the federal government is that it did not limit its role . 
in Quebec and in Canada , nobody expected figures on tax reduction , but we were counting on clear indications that the federal government would significantly reduce the tax burden . 
in order to do it , the federal government does not need to cut transfer payments or any other program . 
it can do so by simply stopping interfering in areas outside its jurisdiction and limiting its spending power to those areas under its responsibility , such as national defence and international affairs . 
if the federal government had restricted its involvement to these areas and had decided , for the two years left in its mandate , to deal only with its constitutional responsibilities , it could have freed up large sums of money that could have gone into the pockets of the middle class and the poor , on whose backs the battle against the deficit was won , and left some room for those actually in charge of important areas as health and education to levy taxes . 
in this regard , the federal government decided , for the sake of visibility , to forgo its responsibilities and revert to the old habits of the Liberal governments we knew in the 1960 s and the 1970 s . 
we will have to keep a very close watch because we could very well face the same situation as before , with a federal government competing with the provinces , interfering in areas under their jurisdiction , buying off the provinces with millions of dollars , and trying to buy the silence of community groups , for instance . 
what we are seeing , such as wanting to provide services in the home , is totally unacceptable . 
my second point is this : if the government was really interested in social fairness , it would have significantly increased transfer payments . 
these days the economy is booming and production is on the rise . 
our problem is the distribution of wealth , and this federal government has decided not to meet that challenge . 
it was not flashy enough for it , not significant enough . 
the Minister of Human Resources Development , who is responsible for the department with most responsibility for the impact on the provinces , and for transfers , seems not to have been heeded by this government . 
the measures she proposed probably did not give the federal government the visibility it wanted . 
the federal government is hiding behind the fact that it is not in the front line in providing services to the population , and it is washing its hands of the outcome . 
then it comes along , a bit like a white knight , to provide home services over the heads of the provinces , who were not able to provide them because the federal government did not give them the necessary funding . 
when it comes down to it , this attitude is close to being Machiavellian and it is something that , in my opinion , the population of Quebec and of Canada does not accept . 
they cannot see themselves in the throne speech that has just been delivered . 
the third aspect that is close to my heart is the entire question of employment insurance . 
with a tour and subsequently with the Employment Insurance Act , it has been demonstrated since 1994 , with well - documented files and briefs , that implementation of this act had created a great many inequities . 
how is it possible that this speech contains nothing that will do away with the rule of intensity , which penalizes the seasonal workers ? 
how can the Liberals across the way accept the fact that their government , at a time when it has $ 6 billion in surplus employment insurance funds yearly , is incapable of putting an end to the injustice this rule of intensity represents ? 
if there are some honourable members who do not know that this rule of intensity is , I will explain it to them . 
each time one of their constituents uses up 20 weeks of emploment insurance , his or her benefits are cut by 1 % . 
this means that , for a seasonal worker who works about twenty weeks each year , after three years , he or she will receive 50 % of his average earnings , rather than 55 % . 
when people earn $ 9 , $ 10 or $ 11 an hour , the difference between the two often represents the money necessary to make ends meet . 
people who have jobs in rural areas are not deemed to be unemployed but , in the end , they still do not have enough money to support their families . 
this is unacceptable . 
the government does not get a passing grade as regards this issue . 
what does social equity mean for the government ? 
is it that it did not use employment insurance to help seasonal workers and young people ? 
only 25 % of all young workers qualify for employment insurance . 
they all contribute to the program now . 
they all have payroll deductions , but only 25 % can get benefits . 
this is unacceptable . 
how can the throne speech talk about fairness and about providing funds for young people and children when the government is not giving anything more to the parents ? 
most children in Canada live with their parents . 
it is the parents who support the family . 
the government did not at all achieve its objectives in that area . 
this morning , I heard the Secretary of State for Rural Development tell us how dedicated he was to taking his responsibilities seriously . 
if he wants results , he should speak to the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of Finance and get this scrapped . 
it is unacceptable . 
it is practically immoral that people should still be living like this in Canada , which calls itself a developed and well - off society . 
this is something that has to be changed . 
here is another example . 
there is the wonderful announcement about parental leave . 
the number of weeks of benefits will be increased to 52 from 26 . 
great . 
in Quebec , one woman out of five or six would qualify with the figure set at 700 . 
furthermore , we saw this already in yesterday ' s news on television . 
could it be more flexible ? 
could I have the opportunity to benefit from it ? " 
it is therefore important to settle this matter , and to have adequate parental leave . 
i will conclude by addressing what was not in this speech . 
it is most astonishing , and if I were a private citizen and not in politics , I would say " What is going on there in the House of Commons ? 
they have a Speech from the Throne that announces policies for two years , but they do not mention anything about airlines '' . 
it is as if they had never heard of Air Canada and Canadian International Airlines . 
there is scarcely any reference to organized crime , yet there are major problems with it too . 
it isn ' t worth the trouble '' . 
why this approach that is divorced from reality ? 
because this government is run by a federal bureaucracy that thinks for us , and decides what is right for us . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for raising an issue that we have not heard enough about in the debate . 
we certainly did not hear any reference to it during the throne speech and we did not hear much reference to it in the subsequent follow up debate . 
the issue I am talking about is the national scandal that exists in our EI system . 
the hon. member pointed out some of its many , many flaws . 
i would like to comment on this briefly and then ask him how he feels about a recommendation I would like to make . 
in my riding of Winnipeg Centre I have problems similar to what the hon. member pointed out . 
the changes to the EI system have taken $ 20 million a year out of my riding alone , out of one inner city riding in Winnipeg . 
can we imagine the impact when $ 20 million a year that used to be transferred from the federal government to my riding is no longer there ? 
we would have to pave the streets with gold to try to get the business to come to our riding . 
the inverse is also true . 
we should be very alarmed when we lose a $ 20 million payroll just from changes to the program . 
the hon. member pointed out the surplus that exists in the fund . 
there is a $ 600 million a month surplus . 
that is something we have been advocating for decades within the building trades and the labour movement . 
finally we are getting reference to that . 
the province of Quebec has a very good system for labour market training through a 1 % training levy . 
in my industry that money is then managed through the CCQ , the Commission de la construction du Qu é bec . 
it manages that money and the training in that sector . 
my question and recommendation would be : 
can we not use some of the enormous surplus in the EI fund for these sectoral councils and make the correct model the national model for the whole country in terms of labour market training ? 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te : 
where I come from , in the Lower St. Lawrence region , the amount is $ 83 million in a given year . 
this is tantamount to telling seasonal workers that they do not work longer because they do not want to . 
why are both not possible ? 
why could the seasonal industry ' s period of activities not be extended ? 
why could we not take an original approach to this and develop our economy and , at the same time , make sure people have an adequate income ? 
right now , they are being treated like economic guinea pigs . 
the door is going to be shut ; the requirements are going to be made so stringent that they will be driven back to work . 
but this is not what will happen . 
in Montreal , a few weeks ago , there was a job fair . 
i think 10,000 people turned up in search of jobs . 
people want jobs . 
what EI has done is to remove the stabilizing effect of the economy . 
today , in a period of economic growth , the federal government does is not playing its role of sharing out the wealth responsibly . 
there is also the member ' s question about the 1 % rule . 
in fact , this allows the focus to be put on training . 
this is one way of preparing ourselves to compete with the rest of the world . 
there was another example of that recently . 
the Quebec minister responsible for economic development , Bernard Landry , offered to help subcontractors obtain contracts with General Motors , to provide them with the conditions that would enable them to develop things . 
the Minister of Industry reacted by saying " No , no , we must not intervene like that . 
we have to let the General Motors plant in Quebec close '' . 
however , they will make sure the one in Ontario stays open . 
there is no future over there . 
we need a government that is responsible in both social and economic terms . 
Quebecers realize , in addition , that they have one government too many in Canada . 
it leads to decisions that are unacceptable and inappropriate for the future of Quebecers . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale . 
i also thank my colleague , the hon. member for Windsor - St. 
Clair , for moving the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne and the hon. member for Laval West for seconding it . 
i extend my congratulations to Her Excellency the Governor General for being installed in that prestigious position . 
it is one which the residents of Waterloo - Wellington think is a great position for her . 
we are grateful for that . 
as reiterated in the Speech from Throne on October 12 , good health and quality care are essential to the well - being of all Canadians . 
the measures announced in the 1999 federal budget will improve access to quality care and help restore the confidence of Canadians in the future of medicare , but a high quality health care system depends on more than money . 
it requires adjustments in the way health care is organized and delivered . 
at their meeting in September 1999 in Charlottetown , health ministers from all Canadian provinces and territories underlined access to quality care and its link to an appropriate supply , deployment and distribution of highly qualified health professionals . 
those ministers agreed to continue to work collaboratively on health resources and the human resources necessary in planning , having noted concrete progress in this area . 
that is also important to note . 
as we have noted , a modern health information system will give health professionals and individual citizens improved access to up to date information about health issues and treatment options . 
the government will ensure that citizens in every region of this great country have access to such information so that they too can make better informed decisions . 
as part of the government ' s plan to improve Canada ' s information infrastructure , the government will reintroduce legislation to protect personal and business information in the digital world . 
the reintroduction of the bill , formerly Bill C - 54 , will have some impact on the development of the health infrastructure . Examples will include that Canada ' s privacy concerns are protected . 
the government ' s intention to build on the personal gateway project to the government information and community content , www . access . ca , 
could tie into the health infrastructure initiatives such as a Canadian Health Network . 
in addition , the government ' s five year plan for improving physical infrastructure includes telecommunication in health . 
the government will also take steps to modernize overall health protection for a changing world . 
investments in the health protection branch national health surveillance infrastructure will be part of this modernization process . 
that too is important . 
the government will also continue to address the serious health problems in aboriginal communities , for example , supporting their efforts to promote wellness and to strengthen the delivery of health services for them . 
the first nations health information system can help achieve this objective in a very meaningful way . 
let me turn my attention to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research which are important vehicles . 
it will fund health research that will improve the quality of life and health of Canadians and lead to more effective health products and services and will result in the strengthening of the Canadian health care system . 
it will offer unique opportunities for economic development in the knowledge based economy . 
this initiative came from the research community which has been working closely with health officials to develop the design and structure of the CIHR . 
the CIHR will integrate the wide range of approaches to health research under a single umbrella organization , providing co - ordination and support for these efforts based on a shared health research agenda . 
biomedical scientists will work collaboratively with clinic researchers ; researchers specializing in health services and systems ; and researchers working on the health of populations , societal and cultural dimensions of health and environmental influences on health . 
the CIHR will be a truly national institution , breaking down traditional barriers between disparate research sectors and different research agencies . 
it will establish strong , co - operative partnerships among researchers , research funders in federal , provincial and territorial governments , voluntary health organizations in the private sector and users of health research in general . 
virtual health research institutes will link researchers working on a common theme . 
these institutes will be guided by a strong ethical framework and will adopt integrated multidisciplinary approaches to health research as a whole . 
the CIHR will provide opportunities and support for Canadian scientists to participate in international collaborations for the benefit of all Canadians , no matter where they live and within the wider global community as well . 
in the budget last February the government gave $ 50 million a year for three years to the granting councils to work toward the objectives of the CIHR . 
the impact of this new funding has already been felt in the research community . 
i look forward to the CIHR bill being introduced this fall . 
i will now turn briefly to a discussion of the Canada health and social transfer , the CHST . 
in the budget of 1999 the Government of Canada announced an investment of $ 11.5 billion over five years in health care . 
this was the single largest new investment the government ever made . 
the increase in the CHST cash from the previous 1999 budget level of $ 12.5 billion to $ 15 billion by 2001 - 02 takes what is regarded as the health component of the CHST to as high a level as it was before the period of expenditure restraint in the mid - 1990 s . 
the budget of 1999 also dealt with the issue of equitable distribution of the CHST to provinces and territories . 
this increase clearly demonstrates the government ' s determination to work with all our partners to provide the absolutely best health care possible to all our citizens . 
all this underscores what we are up to as a government in terms of the throne speech and the vision that will take us into the 21 st century . 
it is important to note that as we march confidently into the 21 st century we do so by linking arms with all Canadians and not , as some would have us do , by leaving some Canadians behind . 
we are doing it with vision , foresight and compassion . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I have a quick question for the member . 
would the member please give me the government ' s excuses for allowing this to happen in the last six years ? 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
madam Speaker , I do know there are ongoing problems that we as Canadians face and that certainly we as a government face . 
we will as a government do the kinds of things that are necessary to put in place initiatives to ensure that those problems are eradicated . 
Canadians expect no less of us and that is what we as a government will be doing . 
we will be doing it with vision and foresight , unlike the party opposite which instead of uniting Canadians in a common cause to eradicate problems seems determined always to take extremist views that pull people apart , that pit region against region , people against people and group against group . 
we on the government side will have no part of that agenda . 
Mercifully and thank God that we do not . 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , the member talks about doing the right thing . 
i want to ask him about a very big crisis facing our country , namely the farming crisis on the prairies , the drop in farm income . 
farm income is going down to negative levels . 
it is the biggest crisis since the 1930 s . 
we now have in Saskatchewan and Manitoba a joint alliance between all the political parties . 
for example , in my province of Saskatchewan all three political parties and the farm groups have gotten together and are requesting of the federal government an additional $ 1 billion in terms of emergency farm aid for our province . 
i am not talking about the AIDA program that is there now . 
i am talking about an additional $ 1 billion minimum of farm aid and farm assistance . 
it has united all three political parties . 
it has united the farm groups and the chamber of commerce . 
i want to ask the member whether he is open to helping us put pressure on the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food to use some of the several billions of dollars of surplus that are now accumulating to help farmers stay on the land . 
when the people have more jobs and the economy is stronger , there is more money for health care , there is more money for tax cuts and there is more money for education . 
whether the member will help us in that lobby is my question . 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
madam Speaker , I really do not need to be lectured by the member opposite about the importance of farmers . 
i still live on the family farm and we settled in 1827 . 
i know the importance of what the family farm means . 
i was part of the tour that went to Saskatchewan and Manitoba this summer . 
i know firsthand the kinds of heartache those farmers are facing . 
it is very real and it is very disturbing . 
we as a government , as the minister of agriculture mentioned today , along with our provincial partners have committed the kinds of resources that are necessary to do the right thing in that very important area . 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
the Governor General ' s words were particularly welcome to those of us in Toronto Centre - Rosedale because the Governor General and her husband John Ralston Saul live in Toronto Centre - Rosedale . 
Toronto Centre - Rosedale is an extremely diverse riding in the middle of downtown Toronto . 
St. James town has 20,000 people living in it . 
fifty - seven different languages are spoken there . 
those languages are spoken by people who live and work here in Canada together because we have established a country which has as its base a certain notion of tolerance and a willingness to work together . 
we have certain Canadian values that make that work . 
an hon. member : 
what about the value of equality for all the people ? 
Mr. Bill Graham : 
we will see how the opposition party treats those matters when they come before the House when we talk about equality . 
we can look at the businessmen in our ridings . 
we are aware of the economic requirements of a modern economy , or the cultural dimension of my riding in Cabbagetown , or the universities and community colleges . 
we are proud to have in our riding the University of Toronto , Ryerson university , George Brown community college and Coll è ge des Grands Lacs . 
we are proud to have mixed communities like that of St. Lawrence where an enormous number of co - ops are contributing to the way in which we manage our relations in a complex urban environment today . 
the Speech from the Throne responds to the needs of this community as it responds to the needs generally of Canadians . 
it addresses the needs of children . 
it addresses the need for investment in science and technology so that our universities and researchers can grow and make this a stronger country . 
the throne speech addresses the issues of the environment , health and agriculture in spite of some of the comments that were made in the House today . 
the north is very important for this country and is seldom mentioned . 
it was important for us to see mention of the north and our arctic in the Speech from the Throne . 
it also addresses the needs of the business community to see tax reductions . 
we heard today in question period of $ 16.5 billion projected for the future with possibilities of greater reductions to come . 
it is a balanced approach , exactly what I would have expected of the government . 
it focuses on the needs of Canadians generally to ensure that those in society have a good government that furnishes them with the services they need and at the same time ensures that we have a healthy and vibrant economy that is able to deliver those services . 
the Speech from the Throne spoke of the role of Canada and Canadians in a world that is evolving . 
it recognized that we cannot be prosperous or healthy in a world that is not prosperous and healthy . 
the government understands that Canadians live in an integrated world and that activities outside our borders affect us on a daily basis . 
we are adapting ourselves to world conditions in a responsible way and in a way to ensure that Canadian values and interests are protected in that world . 
Canadians are also concerned that globalization is forcing changes on us which we do not wish to accept . 
our determination therefore is to ensure that the institutions in which Canada is represented abroad will both protect and advance our values and interests . 
the people ' s needs have to be put ahead of those of states . 
in short , it is what our foreign affairs minister calls the human security agenda . 
it is the agenda of ensuring that individuals are more important than states as we go into the 21 st century in a world in which borders and state sovereignty is being eroded in favour of individual protection and the need to ensure that everybody is guaranteed a better standard of living throughout the world . 
Canadians are a generous people . 
we recognize that in helping our neighbours we help ourselves . 
the Speech from the Throne spoke directly to that and it is an inspiration for us all to enable us to be more effective with our global responsibilities . 
the Speech from the Throne demonstrates the ability of the government to achieve that . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
it being 2:30 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11:00 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
( the House adjourned at 2:30 p.m. )

government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
when debate was last interrupted the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale had five minutes left for questions and comments . 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member ' s speech was so unmemorable that I cannot recall all of the points which I wished to ask him about . 
however , I have a couple of things which I would like to raise . 
he talked about a balanced approach to financing . 
we all know that in the last couple of years the federal government increased its tax take in this country by $ 18 billion . 
the hon. member makes much of the fact that the government is promising to lower taxes by $ 16.5 billion over the next three years . 
is that Liberal balance ? 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in view of the hon. member ' s comment about my unmemorable speech , maybe I could give a memorable answer to him by saying , yes , that is absolutely my idea of balance . 
let me explain . 
the hon. member knows as well as I do that in the past years we were not in a position to reduce taxes . 
i trust that members of the party opposite would not have advocated reducing taxes given the budget problems we had and the deficit . 
they had huge complaints all the time about the size of the deficit and the debt . 
so that was the responsible attitude to take . 
now we are in a position to do something about taxes . 
in answer to a question , the Minister of Finance said in the House , I believe on Friday , that there were $ 16.5 billion in tax reductions on the table for the next three years . 
what differentiates the hon. member and myself and his riding from my riding is that my riding , as I pointed out in the introduction of my speech , requires an act of sensitive government to issues . 
it requires a government that says there are homeless people in Toronto . 
it requires a government that says there are children who need housing and homes and that it will actively pursue an agenda which will enable them to have better enriched lives , which will help all of us and reduce the ultimate tax burden by reducing the problems of social conditions which produce delinquency and other issues in our society . 
this is what we need in government . 
this is the balance of which I spoke . 
there is investment in infrastructure at the university level . 
the students and faculties at the University of Toronto , Ryerson and George Brown College are all thrilled to see an active government of this country saying that it will reward excellence and ensure that our institutions of higher learning are well equipped to ensure that we have the best brains in this country contributing to the ability of the country to go into the 21 st century well prepared . 
that is what I mean by a properly balanced approach . 
yes , tax reductions ; but , yes , a government which recognizes there are needs for our citizens at all levels that have to be fulfilled . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale is a person with an extraordinarily good grasp of global and economic issues who always brings to the House very erudite and insightful comments . 
does he see the new spending that the federal government is committing to , the sparse commitment to tax reduction and the meagre commitment to debt reduction as being negative given the state of the Canadian dollar and the importance of addressing the fundamental issues of lowering debt , lowering taxes and controlling spending in the long term , in terms of fiscal and monetary policy and currency levels ? 
i would appreciate the hon. member ' s comments because our Canadian dollar has been weakened significantly under this government . 
Mr. Bill Graham : 
Mr. Speaker , I should have recognized that the hon. member ' s kind words at the beginning of his question were about to cover some sting that was coming at the end of the scorpion ' s tail . 
i am surprised that the he is coming so close to the previous hon. member who spoke . 
i thought there was an attempt to differentiate his party from other members further to the centre in the House . 
i am a little surprised by the tenor of the question , but I am really surprised that the hon. member , because I respect his economic judgment , would say the government is responsible for the weakening of the Canadian dollar in the last few years . 
as he knows , it is exactly our fiscal and our appropriate approach to the management of the economy of the country that has protected the Canadian dollar and allowed us to get to where we are today . 
that is why I believe strongly that we need not just a focus on tax reduction or on debt relief , but a focus on those social requirements of Canadians that I referred to earlier in my speech . 
that is where the balance comes . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
before we continue I thought it would be a good idea to go over how we will handle questions and comments . 
if there are a lot of members interested in asking questions , they will stand when I first call questions and comments . 
at that time I will try to pick three and I will ask that the questions and responses to be kept to between 30 and 60 seconds . 
that way more people will be able to get their oars in the water . 
if it seems that there are just one or two people , or perhaps just one , then we will relax that rule a little . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be splitting my time with the member for Winnipeg Centre . 
i am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Speech from the Throne and to send a message to parliament from the people in my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre . 
the people in my constituency are working very hard to build their future , our community and to contribute to Canada . 
they are people who get out of bed , work hard every day , who look after their kids and organize programs at the local community centre , who coach at the rink or help out at the seniors ' centre . 
they share a sense of pride for their neighbourhoods and are determined to make a difference . 
i will provide a little idea of just how people in my riding are making a difference in spite of some very difficult odds and conditions . 
in the last little while we have celebrated many important anniversaries . 
i want to mention , for example , the 15 th anniversary of the North End Women ' s Centre , an organization working to provide counselling , training opportunities and employment for hard pressed women . 
i want to mention the 50 th anniversary of Inkster School , a wonderful example of good , solid public education that needs the support of all levels of government . 
let me also mention the 50 th anniversary of the Shaughnessy United Church which is working very hard in my constituency to be a presence , to bring a spiritual contribution to our area . 
let me mention the 20 th anniversary of Bleak House , a very important centre for seniors working to ensure social and recreational opportunities for all of our senior citizens . 
it reveals a history of courage , tenacity and faith . 
from its earliest days , the Holy Ghost Parish helped early settlers adjust to life in this new land . 
it became a focal point for , in this case Polish culture , but it also worked to serve the needs of new immigrants right across western Canada . 
today I mentioned this centennial because it represents the pioneering spirit in the country . 
it talks about those who built this great country , who devoted so much time and energy and who sacrificed so much in order to foster the spiritual and cultural growth of our community and the country . 
all of those organizations are trying very hard to make a difference but the odds are working against them because of a failure of federal leadership . 
in my own area , along with the constituency of Winnipeg Centre , we have the highest rate of poverty anywhere in the country . 
we have a housing crisis that is beyond description in the Chamber . 
just in the last couple of weeks we have had another dozen or more arsons of vacant properties in the inner city and north end of Winnipeg . 
in that context , let me reference the Speech from the Throne which suggests that the government , in response to the housing crisis of the land , is going to study the roots of the problems of homelessness . 
the situation in areas like Winnipeg North Centre do not need to be studied any more . 
i can tell the House right now just what the problem is . 
this is an area that has few economic opportunities because of the policies of the government . 
this is an area that has been totally abandoned by the government offloading its responsibility for housing onto other levels of government . 
this is an area that has been abandoned by the big banks . 
in the next couple of months we will see another two branches close in my area . 
there are other examples right across the country . 
this is a situation where people are very much the victims of federal government neglect and of the failure of leadership that permeates every aspect of our society . 
the people in Winnipeg North Centre are prepared to do their part to build communities but they want the support of government . 
they need the co - operation of government and they need the vision of government to do just that . 
when I was at the celebration marking the very important occasion of the 100 th anniversary of the Holy Ghost Parish , the pastor at that church , whose name is Father Karciarz , actually summed up the situation in the best way possible . 
he quoted from a prayer by Archbishop Oscar Romero who said : 
we plant the seeds that one day will grow . 
we water seeds already planted , knowing that they hold future promise . 
we lay foundations that will need further development . 
we provide yeast that produces far beyond our capabilities . 
we must ensure that those seeds are watered daily . 
we must lay the foundation for building a better society and a better day . 
they turn to the government and especially the throne speech for that sign , the road map of how we will create a better day . 
they look to the government for a vision to help us overcome these great difficulties around poverty , homelessness , deplorable housing conditions , unemployment and lack of recreational opportunities for our young people . 
they expect a throne speech to be in tune with that vision , those ideas and those seeds of hope . 
what did they get from the Speech from the Throne ? 
they got an absolute failure of leadership and an abdication of government responsibility . 
there was no sign of a vision and no hope for the future . 
on every critical issue facing the country , the government is either silent or it claims to be studying the issue . 
there is no mention of the housing crisis , the fishing crisis or the farm crisis . 
there is no mention of the real problems facing families and communities right across the country . 
nowhere is this more apparent than when it comes to health care . 
we are under a serious assault in the country as a result of the failure of federal leadership and an agenda that very much supports the privatization of our health care system . 
we are under the double assault of the dismantling of our universal health coverage system and the dismantling of our health protection system . 
this should be readily apparent today as we hear that there are 200 scientists in the government ' s own department who are crying out with a message that we are headed toward despair and doom on the health safety front unless the government decides to resume responsibility and provide leadership . 
if nothing else , perhaps the government will listen to the words of its own former minister of health , Monique B é gin , who said : " Canada ' s cherished medicare system is steadily eroding and could one day collapse because of federal disregard '' . 
if the government will not listen to the words of the opposition , surely it will listen to the words of those who have helped to preserve and protect our health care system , one of its own former colleagues , the Hon. Monique B é gin . 
i represent an area that was held by both Stanley Knowles and David Orlikow , two people who stood and fought for health care , pensions , unemployment insurance , protection for our families and ways to end poverty and despair in our communities . 
we have a great responsibility to carry on that legacy and it is one we take very seriously . 
i hope we can impress upon members of the government the need for addressing the real concerns of Canadians : being there at times of crisis and offering leadership that builds upon the sense of co - operation and community that has been so much part of the history of the country . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member mentioned the former minister of health , Monique B é gin . 
i had the opportunity to be her critic for four years in the House of Commons between 1980 and 1984 , a period in which we were leading up to the introduction of the Canada Health Act . 
the Canada Health Act is fresh in my mind because I just finished reading a copy of the Hill Times in which the headline stated that the Canada Health Act was 35 years old , although the article was a little more accurate . 
the Canada Health Act was only introduced in 1984 . 
prior to that , we had other legislation with other names . 
the purpose of the Canada Health Act was to discourage extra billing by physicians and user fees . 
the Canada Health Act incorporated all the previous legislation into this one piece of legislation . 
i welcome the mention of Monique B é gin because it seems to me that she was the last minister of health we have ever had in the country who did something to actually protect medicare . 
subsequent ministers of health have , for one reason or another , presided over the dismantling of our health care system , generally through the introduction of unilateral cutbacks . 
as the hon. member mentioned , we now see two threats . 
i am sure that if she had more time she would have mentioned a third threat , which is that health services may be put on the table at the upcoming round of negotiations at the WTO . 
i am sure I have said enough for the hon. member to comment more on the issue that she is so concerned about and on which she does such a good job of caring about in the House , the protection of our health care system . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the wisdom of my colleague , the member for Winnipeg - Transcona , who has been involved in these issues for some 20 years . 
he probably knows better than anyone else the struggle in Canada for a universal , comprehensive health care system . 
it is absolutely clear that Monique B é gin will go down in history as the last person in the federal government to be seen fighting for medicare . 
she was very clear in her recent comments about what is required . 
she pointed to the fact that " erosion of medicare is the slow concealed process which suddenly leads to landslides and collapses . 
is that what we want ? '' . 
obviously we do not want that . 
we have a universal health care system in the country that must be defended against all pressures including our own worst enemy , the Liberal government , which has overseen the dismantling of the system through steadfast cutbacks over the years , has willingly allowed the private sector to invade the health care sector and , as my colleague for Winnipeg - Transcona has said , is prepared to allow free - floating discussions at the WTO around health care services to be up for grabs at the table in the international sphere . 
those are two obvious threats to health care in the country . 
the third threat , which I hinted at earlier , is the dismantling of our health protection system . 
we have in the country a tradition of a tough regulatory approach to ensure that the food we eat , the drugs we need , the water we drink and the medical devices we need to use are safe beyond a reasonable doubt . 
we have operated in the country on the basis of a " do no harm " principle . 
if there is a concern or a doubt then we ensure that we do not allow that product to be consumed by Canadians until we know the long term health consequences . 
it is an area that cries out for government leadership . 
we are desperately hoping that the government will address both areas of health care : the preservation of a universal , publicly administered health insured system and the strongest possible national food safety and health protection system imaginable . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there can be no doubt that the Speech from the Throne is a very carefully crafted document . 
one thing I have come to realize in the short time I have been here is that there is probably no other piece of work that is done on the Hill that is so scrutinized and carefully put together . 
one can almost see dozens of bureaucrats burning the midnight oil in the catacombs of this building agonizing over every word that goes into it to make sure it is exactly , perfectly put together . 
the reason I point this out is that there are no accidents in the Speech from the Throne . 
if there is something missing from it , it is not by omission , it is missing for a good reason . 
it has been thought through very carefully for the message that it sends . 
we all know there are two ways to send a message . 
one way is by putting the message in the document and one is by leaving it out . 
as a westerner from the prairie region , the most glaring omission in the Speech from the Throne has to be the complete absence of any reference to the agricultural crisis that we face in the prairie region . 
i did not come to Ottawa to get on the hobby horse about western alienation . 
frankly , I did not even think I would ever be standing up in the House speaking about western alienation , but the longer I am here the more I realize how important and grating this issue really is for a person from the west . 
we are all very sympathetic to the issue of the lobster crisis on the east coast . 
we realize it is a real problem . 
however , we have an emergency in western Canada in the prairie region . 
it is not just an isolated incident . 
it is not just a part of our industry that is suffering . 
the whole shebang is at risk of losing what developed western Canada , which is our agribusiness . 
forty per cent of all prairie farmers run the risk of being out of business by the end of this selling cycle if something does not happen . 
if some intervention does not take place , 40 % of all people who work on family farms today will be gone , kaput , and that does not even begin to talk about all the many industries that rely on a vibrant agricultural industry . 
with all due respect to our colleagues from eastern Canada , we do not see the minister hopping on the plane to get to western Canada immediately to deal with the crisis , as we do with the lobster fishery . 
the minister was on the plane the next morning , meeting with all the stakeholders down there and trying to carve out some way of dealing with that crisis . 
is it that our crisis is not as important as their crisis ? 
are we to weigh whose crisis is most severe ? 
i put it to the House quite frankly that the other issue pales in comparison to what is going on in western Canada . 
one might wonder why I would use my 10 minutes to talk about agriculture . 
it is the core area of Winnipeg . 
that whole exchange area was built up because of a vibrant farm economy that we now stand to lose . 
however , if there was a single line which said the Government of Canada recognized that it has to intervene in some way to protect the agricultural industry in western Canada , that would be some comfort . 
it would be some solace and people in that industry might say that at least the government appreciates that they have a problem . 
it not just a matter of throwing money at it . 
i am not saying that everybody who lives on a farm , whether they are good farmers or bad farmers , should get a bailout from the Canadian government . 
nobody is advocating that . 
it is a host of problems that have compounded and conspired to defeat the family farmer , whether it is world commodity prices or the corporate domination of the whole industry in terms of access to seeds . 
one thing that scared the heck out of me recently was told to me by a group of farmers . 
it almost seems like this is part of some master plan : drive the small farmer off the farm so that the corporate sector can come in and make farming a corporate industry instead of a family enterprise . 
one graphic illustration of why that is not just paranoia is the way that canola seed is dealt with . 
it controls the supply and purchasing of the product . 
at the same time it genetically alters the seed so that it cannot reproduce itself . 
it dead ends after one season . 
unlike normal plants it cannot reproduce itself . 
it has been neutralized that way and the next year one has to go back to the same company to buy seed again . 
it is a serfdom . 
it is a return to serfdom . 
they are agro - serfs , multimillion dollar agro - serfs . 
these are the kinds of things that Canadians are trying to awaken the Canadian public to and nobody is listening . 
there used to be champions in the House of Commons for the prairie farmer . 
at one time we had a western protest party that actually spoke out on behalf of prairie farmers instead of just the corporate agricultural industry . 
unfortunately we do not hear a great deal of that today and , try as we might , we cannot get that issue in the forefront . 
the Liberal government has missed an opportunity to buy some support in western Canada by at least being sensitive to that issue . 
that is really how one could summarize the Speech from the Throne . 
another missed opportunity that is self - evident for me because it is in my critic area is immigration . 
all summer long , for the past six months , we have been seeing an hysteria about immigration whipped up by my colleagues in the Reform Party and their right wing counterparts in western Canada . 
they are trying to convince us that we have an emergency on our hands because 400 or 500 Chinese migrants have drifted to our shore . 
i have heard terms like this is the biggest breach to national security since the FLQ crisis . 
that is one of the points they have made . 
i do not know how to say balderdash or poppycock in terms that are parliamentary , but I have never heard such nonsense in my life . 
i guess I just did . 
my colleague for Winnipeg North Centre raised the issue of child poverty . 
i was just reading the comments of the member for Winnipeg - Transcona in his speech . 
he reminded the House of Commons that we are up to the 10 th anniversary of a unanimous motion in the House of Commons which said we would eradicate child poverty by the year 2000 . 
that was moved by the leader of the NDP at that time in 1989 and it passed unanimously . 
not a single person voted against such a laudable concept that by the year 2000 we would somehow eradicate child poverty within our borders . 
i remind members of the House that we live in the richest and most powerful civilization in the history of the world . 
i ask members to defend in any way they can why there should be anybody living in poverty within our borders . 
as I said , I represent an inner city riding and so does the member for Winnipeg North Centre . 
we have three of the five poorest postal zones in the country . 
poverty is an issue that we are seized with every day . 
there is not a day when we go to work that we are not dealing with somebody ' s urgent social emergency in terms of poverty issues . 
yet in the Speech from the Throne we heard very little . 
we heard nothing about the important resolution that was passed in 1989 , and only passing remarks about the issue of the fair redistribution of wealth building equity into our society . 
i would like to see some costing of it . 
i cannot wait for the budget to come out to see what it will cost the Government of Canada . 
i would suggest that it will cost very little . 
the EI surplus is $ 600 million a month and not per year . 
what the government will spend in lengthening the EI benefits for mothers on maternity leave might cost $ 50 million a year . 
i have sort of done some costing on my own . 
some $ 50 million a year versus $ 500 million or $ 600 million a month . 
where is the rest of that money going ? 
the Canadian public is still being cheated and the EI reform is not nearly far enough . 
it is another missed opportunity . 
the government could have addressed that glaring oversight . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
when the throne speech came down it talked about wanting to give it only to maternity leave . 
would the hon. member agree with me that the government is not taking responsibility for the new jobs and for women returning to work ? 
to go on maternity leave now they need 700 hours . 
many women do not qualify for EI . 
we saw again this morning on the first page of the Globe and Mail that many women do not qualify . 
they do not qualify for EI . 
1140 
as I have said many times , the Liberal government has stolen from working people and another $ 30 billion from the public sector pension plan . 
some $ 54 billion have been stolen from the working people . 
the government is not taking responsibility for working people . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i want to caution members . 
the member for Acadie - Bathurst indicated that the government has stolen or the Liberals have stolen . 
as long as there is not a direct attribution to a specific minister or a specific ministry it is a political metaphor but certainly it is not to be taken literally . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for pointing out those pressing issues regarding the EI program . 
we all know that when unemployment insurance reform took place it made it more difficult to qualify . 
people could collect for a shorter period of time and receive less money per week . 
it was a recipe for a surplus . 
the government is using the EI system as a cash cow to harvest money from employers and employees to use for whatever it wants . 
as the member pointed out , there is no such thing as the EI fund . 
all that money goes into general revenues and the government can spend it on whatever it wants . 
i have always argued that to deduct something from a person ' s paycheque for a specific reason and then use it for something entirely different is fraud . 
at the very least it is a breach of trust . 
the government told us it would use if for one purpose and used it for another . 
it is completely misleading . 
the Canadian Labour Congress hired Statistics Canada to do some research on the impact on a riding per riding basis . 
can we imagine losing that amount of income , wages or salaries out of one intercity riding per year ? 
in one area of Newfoundland it is $ 70 million per year . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
does the member believe that the government should have at the very least put together some sort of vision in the throne speech as to the support the government should be putting into agriculture right now ? 
the government does not seem to have any direction at all . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member for Brandon - Souris is very knowledgeable about these issues . 
to answer his question simply , all it would have taken is one or two lines in the Speech from the Throne to recognize that we have a problem in western Canada , that we have an emergency that needs to be addressed . 
the government did not have to write pages and pages . 
to answer the member ' s question , it is a missed opportunity on the part of Liberals to give some comfort to those of us in western Canada who feel more alienated than ever . 
Mr. Ian Murray ( Lanark - Carleton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Etobicoke - Lakeshore . 
i congratulate Her Excellency the Governor General on both her appointment and inspirational address which she delivered on the occasion of her installation . 
those of use who were privileged to witness that event were , I believe without exception , moved by her thoughtful and powerful address . 
i compliment the hon. members for Windsor - St. 
Clair and Laval West on their eloquent remarks in moving and seconding the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne . 
it is traditional that participants in this debate describe and praise the unique character of their constituencies . 
i have always felt particularly fortunate to represent Lanark - Carleton in the House of Commons . 
it encompasses one of Canada ' s major high technology clusters centred in but not restricted to the city of Kanata . 
it has a large rural area which includes much of Kanata and extends through West Carleton township in the county of Lanark , officially the maple syrup capital of Ontario . 
in its towns and dotted throughout its landscape are numerous substantial and handsome stone homes and public buildings , a legacy of the Scottish stonemasons who were among the settlers who arrived in the last century . 
the people of Lanark - Carleton are very aware and proud of their heritage . 
at the same time , explosive growth of Kanata driven by successful high tech companies and entrepreneurs has added a dynamic sense of energy , pride and optimism to that historic and beautiful part of Canada . 
coupled with pride in its heritage is a sincere and energetic concern for the environment . 
one does not have to travel far to be close to nature . 
the increased pressure on water resources for industrial and recreational use has led to real concern in particular within the farming community . 
the spirit of co - operation that exists among those seeking solutions in an era of diminished financial resources is reason to be hopeful . 
i have mentioned the contribution of high technology to my riding . 
its importance cannot be overstated . 
i was pleased therefore to see that the government recognizes the interrelated role of so many factors that allow high tech companies to flourish . 
the success or failure of any business depends on the quality of its management and the skills , knowledge and enthusiasm of its employees . 
very simple rules of human behaviour govern the response of individuals and therefore companies to both threats and opportunities . 
we live in a era when changes to global trade rules and patterns have subjected business to unprecedented competition . 
governments do though have the ability to create the conditions and environment that will encourage companies to take risks and encourage individuals to be entrepreneurs . 
one aspect of that is the burden of taxation , both personal and corporate . 
taxes in Canada are high both historically and in comparison with our neighbour and major trading partner , the United States . 
however , the relatively recent and sustained campaign in favour of major tax cuts demonstrates just how short term some people ' s memories can be . 
there was always the recognition that economic growth could stall . 
we were not prepared to achieve a budgetary surplus only to be thrown into a deficit situation by a future economic downturn . 
tax cutting has begun . 
measures from the last three budgets will mean 600,000 low income Canadians will no longer pay federal income tax . 
the current clamour for tax cuts comes from those in the top tax bracket . 
that is understandable and the fact is one does not have to earn an enormous salary to be in that bracket , which brings me back to the brain drain . 
the disparity in income tax levels between Canada and the United States has been a significant factor for high tech companies in my riding that need to attract and keep skilled employees . 
my message to both employers and employees is simple : your patience is about to be rewarded . 
i will quote from the throne speech : 
tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the growth and wealth which enable those public and private investments necessary for a high quality of life . 
in its next budget the government will set out a multi - year plan for further tax reduction . 
i included that quotation because many media reports suggested the speech gave little importance to lower taxes . 
the message is clear and the details will be spelled out in the February budget . 
this session of parliament appears to be built around the theme of " Canada , the place to be in the 21 st century '' . 
i applaud the idea . 
it reminds me of a suggestion made by Dr. Howard Alper , vice - rector of research at the University of Ottawa . 
while considering the Canadian scientific diaspora , those top scientists and academics who are now abroad , Dr. Alper suggested a rediscover Canada program . 
canada can only benefit by having many of its finest researchers available to , in particular , graduate students . 
i was excited therefore to hear of the government ' s decision to fund a program known as the 21 st century chairs for research excellence . 
the federal granting councils already play a very significant role in funding university research . 
they will now be responsible for enabling the establishment of 1,200 new chairs for research excellence in universities across the country . 
the objective is to have a total of 2,000 chairs as soon as possible . 
that is the kind of bold leadership required if Canada is to be known as the country that celebrates excellence . 
i would extend that idea , though not the model , to other areas of human endeavour . 
there has been a recent and overdue recognition of the need to celebrate our national heroes . 
fellow Canadians who are successful on the world stage make us feel good about ourselves and serve as role models for others . 
an obvious area is amateur athletics . 
in this era of multimillionaire professional athletes , to whom few of us can relate , we should remember the pride we always feel when our Olympic athletes perform well . 
at a time when study after study raises the alarm about how physically inactive our children are , we should look for ways to encourage amateur athletics . 
that will also require an investment in developing top quality coaches . 
along with celebrating excellence we should be known as a country that welcomes and supports creative minds . 
that means Canada is the place to be for artists , among others . 
one has only to look at the excitement created by Pinchas Zucherman becoming music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra . 
often relatively small incremental costs mean the difference between experiencing the merely competent and the truly outstanding . 
many small steps can lead to a better country . 
one example is the annual Prime Minister ' s awards for teaching excellence . 
another is the Governor General ' s award for caring Canadians . 
it is important to recognize and highlight the achievements of unsung heroes . 
one group of heroes we can never properly thank is our war veterans . 
those of us who have been fortunate enough to never experience war can have no real idea of what it was like . 
we became a country in the eyes of the world thanks to battles like Vimy Ridge . 
to recognize and celebrate the lives of those who died for Canada is not to celebrate war . 
it is a fundamental overarching responsibility we have to make succeeding generations know the price that was paid for our freedom . 
i mention this in the course of this debate because another debate has been going on for far too long about building a new Canadian war museum . 
i believe the government should release from their commitment those who offered to raise money for the museum . 
just build it . 
i have seen much of the museum ' s collection that is unavailable to the public because of space restrictions and I can assure everyone that it deserves to be on display . 
i am aware of no other national institution that depended on private fundraising to be built . 
i hope there will be an early announcement that construction will soon begin on the new museum . 
the Speech from the Throne addressed the need for an infrastructure for the 21 st century . 
the most visible is the physical infrastructure we require as a trading nation to enable the free flow of goods and services . 
in addition to transport , the five year plan will focus on tourism , telecommunications , culture , health and safety and the environment . 
that is an ambitious objective but one which I believe Canadians will support . 
the government has set a goal to be known around the world as a government most connected to its citizens . 
it will also take steps to accelerate our adoption of electronic commerce and encourage its use throughout the economy . 
there are challenges associated with electronic commerce . 
in the last session of parliament we worked on legislation to protect personal and business information and to recognize electronic signatures . 
it is important that Canadians recognize and seize the opportunity we enjoy , because of our leadership in communications technology , to be a world leader in the control and use of electronic commerce . 
i want to acknowledge and support the government ' s commitment to building stronger communities . 
in much of the industrialized world we have seen a growing gulf between rich and poor . 
there are almost daily media reports of newly minted high tech millionaires and corporate executives enjoying incomes that are many multiples of those earned by their rank and file employees . 
globalization has led many to question the importance of national boundaries . 
every new round of trade negotiations appears to lessen the ability of governments to act on behalf of their citizens . 
when Canadians are asked what separates them from Americans , we often point to our system of health care . 
a search for the defining idea of what makes Canada unique remains elusive . 
i suggest however that the answer may lie in embracing the idea of community . 
it is not a weakness to be seen around the world as a country that supports the less fortunate . 
it is not a weakness to be known as a country that embraces cultural diversity and welcomes new immigrants with their skills , energy and ambition to build a better life for themselves and their children . 
the danger would be in a retreat toward isolation as provinces , as communities and as individuals . 
we as members of parliament have an ambitious agenda before us . 
the challenges set out in the Speech from the Throne are many and real . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the member for Lanark - Carleton . 
he addressed the issue of the brain drain as being very serious . 
i wonder how that squares with his government ' s record on a lot of these issues and the reasons for the fact that our society has this brain drain . 
the conference board two weeks ago came out with a report which said that Canadians are falling back in terms of innovation and that we are losing some of our brightest people to the United States . 
that is a fact of life we all know about . 
when our committee on international trade asked small and medium size companies why they did not export outside of Canada , they said that too much government regulation was a serious inhibitor to doing business in Canada . 
taxes , including payroll taxes , were a deterrent . 
there were interprovincial trade barriers . 
i noticed the premier of Ontario on the weekend said that it was easier to do business with several American states than it is with Canadian provinces . 
the government has been in power for the last six years and we still have these serious problems . 
there is a 50:50 split on how it is going to decide what is going to be spent on spending and on debt and tax relief . 
yet we have seen social spending increased so there is nothing left to split 50:50 . 
what is the government doing ? 
it has had six years to address these issues and nothing much has changed . 
Mr. Ian Murray : 
Mr. Speaker , it is important to remember that these problems did not spring up overnight . 
if we look at the history of research and development expenditures in Canada , they have languished at the low end of the G - 7 for many years . 
that is largely because of the branch plant economy we had in Canada . 
the brain drain problem is partly related to taxes . 
it is a very important component and I am pleased it is going to be addressed . 
the hon. member referred to trade . 
a lot people ridicule these trips abroad as junkets that do not accomplish anything . 
the fact is for years businesses have been asking ministers - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt the member . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member opposite rather well . 
he is one of the august members on the Liberal benches . 
i do not know a single issue that has been raised more by constituents across Canada as to why this is the case . 
not one single solitary statement was made in the Speech from the Throne dealing with this particular issue . 
he completely ignored what the intent of parliament was when that law was first passed . 
he used his own technical legal interpretation of a particular issue . 
when we asked the government to invoke the notwithstanding clause , there was deathly silence . 
could the hon. member say if it has come to the point where the government does not have the courage to deal with issues that are controversial and reflect the interests and the wants of the people of Canada ? 
Mr. Ian Murray : 
Mr. Speaker , not at all . 
it is important to remember that until 1993 the country existed without the law my hon. colleague is referring to . 
as well , it is important to remember that any exploitation of children and the production and distribution of child pornography is still illegal . 
i am concerned that the law may have been carelessly drafted . 
apparently it is possible that if somebody has written something themselves and maintains it in their possession and it can be defined as pornographic , then they can be charged . 
that is not the sort of thing we are worried about in the House . 
i was one of those who very early on called for the Prime Minister to address the problem created by that judicial decision in British Columbia . 
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
i also want to begin by wishing the legendary former prime minister , the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau , a happy 80 th birthday , with wishes from my constituents for many , many happy years to come . 
the Speech from the Throne gives reasons to my constituents and to all Canadians to be optimistic about the future of Canada . 
i said that on Friday when I spoke to four classes of grade 10 students . 
i encouraged them to watch the debate in the House today , and I am convinced that many of them will be watching . 
therefore I am pleased to make my remarks with the hope that it will enlighten them and with the hope that the remarks from other members will show them the extent to which the Speech from the Throne has set out a vision . 
the government has set a course for Canada in the next millennium . 
it has paved the way in building a nation in which the quality of life of Canadians will continue to be unmatched in the world . 
for several years in a row the United Nations has declared Canada to be the best country in which to live . 
the commitments we made in the Speech from the Throne will ensure that our country will remain so for many years . 
to the students who are watching , we hope that it will also be the case for many years in their lifetime . 
last Wednesday the Prime Minister stated that Canada is the place to be in the 21 st century . 
i agree . 
six years ago when the government took office our country was described as a third world country . 
our economic growth was slow . 
the deficit and unemployment were high . 
this economic malaise impacted our communities across Canada , including those in Etobicoke - Lakeshore . 
i recall a time when there were many closures in my riding : stores , businesses and manufacturing areas . 
today I know that our country will be well situated economically and socially to be a world leader in the next century and beyond . 
the government has done this by adopting a comprehensive , balanced economic strategy that has transformed Canada to becoming one of the strongest economies of the G - 7 . 
with this strategy our government will continue to strengthen Canada by recommitting itself to economic policies that will allow us to keep the national debt on a permanent downward track , reduce taxes for Canadians and invest in knowledge , innovation , children , youth and health . 
these are the themes of the throne speech . 
the Speech from the Throne enables the government to further its efforts . 
Canadians may recall that this is what the government said it would do : 50 % for tax and debt reduction , 50 % for economic and social needs . 
the constituents of Etobicoke - Lakeshore believe that in the global economy knowledge and technological innovations are the cornerstones of the highest standard of living and a better quality of life . 
our quality of life and standard of living can be secured in the future if we are willing to explore new frontiers in innovation . 
investment in research and development is central to this . 
we need to build an infrastructure of skills development and innovation to foster opportunities for Canadians to pursue lifelong learning . 
i see this in my constituency . 
the federal government has created initiatives such as the Canada Foundation for Innovation , and Technology Partnerships Canada to put Canadians on this path . 
many of my constituents have received benefits from the $ 1 billion endowment to the Canada Foundation for Innovation which is helping to build a leading edge national system of innovation . 
through the research granting councils the government will fund the creation of 1,200 new 21 st century chairs for research excellence in Canadian universities over the next three years . 
the cost of the program will be $ 60 million in the first year , $ 120 million in the second , $ 180 million in the third year and it will be ongoing . 
perhaps they can see that there is an advantage for their parents and older siblings who are presently at university in research areas . 
canada ' s place in the 21 st century cannot be secure unless we commit to investing in children . 
they are the future of our country and the strength of our society . 
we dealt with individuals in rent geared to income facilities and I saw the socioeconomic situation of many of our children . 
over the past six years the federal government has endeavoured to provide families with support in caring for their children . 
my constituents expect nothing less from the government but to ensure that our health care system is modern and sustainable . 
i know of several who are watching the direction in which the government is going . 
it is trying to ensure that we meet all of those commitments . 
Canadians are committed to preserving and protecting the environment . 
several individuals in my area work on a daily basis in the protection of the environment . 
the Humber River was recently declared a Canadian heritage river . 
there are many other very important environmental niches in Etobicoke - Lakeshore where we must ensure that we clean up areas that are contaminated and that we protect the health of all Canadians . 
the Social Development Community Council in Etobicoke - Lakeshore has a regeneration project and is looking to the direction in which we are going for support for their project . 
the volunteers and people who give of their time and effort in my riding are enthused by the direction in which we are going . 
i call on all members on all sides of the House to view the Speech from the Throne , as it outlines the Liberal vision for Canada ' s future in the new millennium , as building and creating strong communities that will enable us to have a more equitable society for all Canadians . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I found the speech to be rather interesting , but I was actually somewhat disappointed by what it omitted . 
i would like to give the member an opportunity to address some of the issues that she might have included in her remarks rather effectively . 
i would like her to respond to the whole situation of youth in Canada today . 
we have a number of young people who are looking somewhere for a job , hopefully at home in Canada . 
many of them are finding , though , that the tax situation is such that it is preferable for them to find a job elsewhere where they will get more money because the taxes are lower than they are in Canada . 
there is a disadvantage for them to stay at home , assuming they have a job in the first place . 
i would like the hon. member to address that question . 
the other question concerns the youth exchange program across Canada . 
if there is a shortage of funds , which there is , which would the young people rather have , an exchange trip across Canada or a job ? 
Ms. Jean Augustine : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the member because in my discussion with our young people we talked about how debate occurs in the House . 
someone speaks and someone questions or responds . 
i am sure this is a really good example for the young people who are watching . 
to address the issue of jobs I will speak about my riding in particular . 
we have a number of agencies that are working with our young people and a number of initiatives that are on the ground to assist them in finding employment through small business , entrepreneurial adventures and through support . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt : 
what about taxes ? 
Ms. Jean Augustine : 
in terms of moving out of the country , I think the Prime Minister put it very well when he talked about the environment and culture and everything else that makes us Canadian and the importance of holding on to this and not going after small gains in terms of dollars . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was quite pleased to hear the hon. member ' s remarks concerning education for our young people because we know this is a very important issue that has to be dealt with in our country . 
i would like the hon. member to elaborate a bit upon what the government is doing to make it easier for young people through cuts in tuition or something similar which would make their debt load easier as they struggle through university . 
Ms. Jean Augustine : 
Mr. Speaker , there are several things that the Speech from the Throne addressed and several programs that we have been working with . 
i will cite some examples that I had written out , guessing that this might be a question that would be thrown my way . 
our expanded commitment to young people now includes the hiring of youth to put in place additional community Internet access sites in communities across Canada , which we know is the most connected country in the world . 
we have launched Exchanges Canada which will provide 100,000 young Canadians every year a chance to learn about a different part of Canada and support them in that effort . 
we are giving young Canadians from the age of 13 an opportunity to produce their first works using traditional and new technologies in the arts and in cultural , digital and similar industries . 
we are giving young Canadian volunteers the opportunity to help with literacy skills and participate in community and national environmental projects . 
at the same time we have signalled what we will do in terms of student debt and loans and ways in which we can deal with the postponement of the huge debt that young people carry . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be splitting my time this morning with the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest . 
we have the highest tides in the world in the Bay of Fundy and the Minas Basin . 
the Liberals felt the force of those tides in the last general election . 
there was nothing in the throne speech that will reverse those tides in the next federal election . 
the government says that the fundamentals are strong when speaking about the economy . 
it is very important to remember the words of John Kenneth Galbraith , the Canadian economist , who said that we should beware of governments who say that the fundamentals are strong . 
the fundamentals that are important to Canadians are simply not strong under the leadership of the government . 
one of the most important fundamentals is the issue of brain drain . 
the choice that each of us has , particularly young Canadians , in pursuing our lives and careers in Canada or in other countries , particularly with the mobility of populations that exists today , is very important . 
whether or not we are attracting the best and brightest to the country , and particularly whether we are maintaining and keeping the best and brightest here , is a very important fundamental . 
the fact is that in 1986 we lost 17,000 young Canadians to the U.S. through the brain drain process . 
another fundamental is the Canadian dollar . 
under this government the Canadian dollar has dropped from 77 cents in 1993 to the 67 cents range currently , with the dollar being as low as the 64 cents range a year ago last summer . 
the currency of a country represents in many ways the share value of that particular country . 
under this government , the share value of Canada has effectively dropped from 77 cents to the mid - 60 cents range . 
those are very important fundamentals . 
part of that was Mr. Trudeau ' s response to the FLQ crisis at that time and the question of how far would he have gone . 
i suggest that if we were to ask the Prime Minister how far he would go in pursuing the types of economic policies that are aimed at the next election , at the expense of Canadians in the long term , he would probably respond " Just watch me '' . 
the dollar issue is a direct reflection of the high debt levels we have in Canada , the 50 % tax levels , the intrusive regulatory system and things like interprovincial trade barriers which reduce the competitiveness of Canadians and Canadian enterprise globally . 
ironically , a Canadian economist , Robert Mundell , just last week received the Nobel prize in economics for his studies linking currencies to fiscal and monetary policies . 
the government continues to pursue the types of policies and , in this speech , has promised to expand on the same types of negative policies that have us in the mess we are in right now . 
there are 32 pages of spending in the speech , spending tax distortions and regulatory spider webs but really very little action on the tax side . 
the government is now focusing on expanding program spending . 
the government is big on symbols but has really not addressed the health care crisis . 
my constituents are also concerned about defence spending and the government ' s lack of effectively investing in the defence of our country and in our national defence system . 
we are increasingly being called on to participate in an increasingly complicated global scenario , whether it is Kosovo or East Timor , with a very fixed or reduced commitment if one looks at it in real terms to spending . 
in my riding that means CFB Greenwood is facing significant challenges now with the reduced level of government commitment . 
the government is now turning its back on the full functionality of CFB Greenwood . 
the government is ignoring one of the other concerns that Canadians have and that is our national infrastructure system , in particular our highway system . 
highway 101 in my riding is one of the most dangerous highways not just in Nova Scotia but in Canada . 
there have been 38 deaths on the untwined parts of highway 101 over the past several years . 
the government has not made the necessary commitment to highway funding . 
again the government has not addressed a real concern of Canadians . 
with the ever increasing tax burden under the government , Canadian families and individuals have faced a personal disposable income decline of 8 % since 1993 . During the same period , Americans have enjoyed approximately a 10 % increase . 
the government is expanding its taxation . 
it states that it will bring forward $ 16 billion of tax reductions . 
those are the tax reductions that the government has given through the front door . 
what the government fails to remind Canadians is that through the back door , through , for instance , bracket creep , the government has actually taken in more than that , about $ 18 billion . 
the government has actually continued to plunder Canadians through the back door while pretending to provide some level of tax relief through the front door . 
the concern we have is that the government is engaging in almost a corporate re - imaging effort aimed at trying to convince the international community that somehow it is addressing some of the structural deficiencies in the Canadian economy . 
however , it is doing very little to actually change those structural inefficiencies and impediments to actually put Canada on a growth track where we could have a strong dollar and a strong economy . 
the government is trying to devalue its way to prosperity . 
i remember a couple of years ago when the dollar hit about 65 cents the Prime Minister said that a low dollar was good for the Canadian economy and good for tourism . 
now the logical corollary of his argument would be that a dollar trading at zero , if we reduced it to zero , would be excellent for Canadian exports . 
we could give away our goods . 
we would be the greatest exporting nation in the world . 
however , the Prime Minister ' s economic logic is not really that sound in this area . 
we could have a strong dollar and a sustained economic growth if we allowed Canadians to actually enjoy some of the prosperity that other countries are enjoying and actually took the initiative to provide significant tax reform and tax reduction and also address some of these other structural issues , the types of issues which were addressed under the previous government . 
the previous government had the guts to pursue policies like free trade , the GST , deregulation of financial services , transportation and energy . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
before we go to the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale , I just want a brief explanation . 
the use of the word guts in that context was again a political metaphor . 
it was not addressed for or against any person specifically . 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
i am surprised that the member is so oversimplifying this issue of tax . 
i am surprised that he has laid every woe of Canadians at the door of high taxes . 
i remember when there was a brain drain from his province to Toronto . 
the member should not say that high taxes is the reason why the Canadian dollar is low . 
i suggest he look at the Swedish currency , which is very strong today . 
how does the member , with his extraordinary sophisticated knowledge of the working of things , drive down the single lane 101 highway of tax reduction , which he will end up crashing himself and his party with the same problems he has on his highway down in Nova Scotia , instead of looking at all the other factors which we have to address when we are trying to deal with what is a very complex and not a single issue ? 
Mr. Scott Brison : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his , as usual , erudite , intelligent and well placed question . 
the hon. member is a true Liberal in the traditional 1970 s sense . 
he does point to the fact that Canadians are leaving to find greater opportunities elsewhere . 
he and I both agree that Canadians are leaving Canada to find greater opportunities elsewhere . 
where the true Liberal thing comes in is , at this point , where we divide . 
i go one way and he goes another in terms of our pursuit of a solution . 
he believes that government , through government spending , can create better opportunities in Canada to keep Canadians here . 
i believe that if the government reduces taxes we can create better opportunities here . 
in terms of the opportunities for people leaving Canada to seek jobs elsewhere is in part pay . 
it is not all taxes ; part of it is pay . 
however pay is an instrument closely related to corporate tax rates . 
canada has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the OECD . 
last year , for instance , our corporate tax rates were lower than those of Italy and Japan . 
this year we now have higher corporate tax rates than Italy and Japan because Italy and Japan have engaged in tax reform and tax reduction on the corporate side . 
if the hon. member is sincere about pursuing greater opportunities for Canadians then he should unshackle Canadian enterprise and businesses from the burden of his party ' s failure to address corporate tax reform . 
jack Mintz , one of his constituents , submitted an excellent report to the federal government , the Mintz report . 
it was commissioned by the federal Minister of Finance and then ignored by the Minister of Finance . 
i would suggest that this hon. member listen to one of his constituents in Toronto Centre - Rosedale who has provided a great blueprint for tax reform and tax reduction in Canada . 
if followed , it would ensure that ultimately Canadians would enjoy greater opportunities here and not have to seek them elsewhere while the government pursues 1970 s policies which have been discredited around the world and in fact mire Canadians into less opportunities in the future and not more . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to take part in the debate on the Speech from the Throne . 
the government is attempting to hide from some of the very real concerns , some of which we are living through now . 
one is the Donald Marshall ruling in terms of native rights , fishing rights , mineral rights and so on . 
i should say treaty rights in general . 
that is a huge problem in Atlantic Canada but obviously it has implications from one end of the country to the other . 
at this point it is focused on the lobster fishery simply because the lobster fishery is one of the most lucrative fisheries . 
it goes far beyond that but I certainly do not have time in 10 minutes to go into the minute detail . 
yesterday in my home riding in New Brunswick I met with very concerned lobster fishers on Grand Manan Island . 
we have eighth generation fishermen who do not know whether or not they will be able to make a living at their fishery . 
the fisheries minister simply hides under his desk when we talk about it . 
he has yet to bring the native community and the non - native community together to make reasonable progress on this very important issue . 
the next shoe to drop in this whole debate will be the word compensation . 
the fishers accept the fact that the supreme court has ruled . 
we talked about the government exercising the notwithstanding clause to give the fishing community time to resolve the issue because it does not appear as if the minister or the Prime Minister will resolve it . 
we also talked about a stay of the decision . 
the government obviously dropped the ball on that as well . 
a day after the decision can we imagine the Prime Minister of Canada standing up not knowing whether the government could have asked for a stay in the decision or at least get the government time to respond ? 
he could have done that but did not . 
this created a crisis when a crisis could have been avoided . 
that is a big issue that was left out of the Speech from the Throne . 
another one is the merger of Air Canada and Canadian by Onex . 
it appears like we will be looking at an American controlled airline with services diminished in many parts of the country . 
i think the government has to do something . 
the same thing applies to the immigration policy . 
we went through a crisis on the west coast this year in terms of illegal immigrants coming into Canada . 
what has been the response from the various ministries ? 
on the immigration crisis the minister says that winter is coming , so there is not a problem out there that mother nature cannot take care of . 
in the native fishing dispute it is the same . 
winter is coming and the winds will blow . 
thank God for mother nature because the ministers will not take action when it is necessary . 
to go back a little on some of what I have heard from the government side of the House in terms of the throne speech , there has not been a member on the government side speaking on the debate who does not fall back on their financial success . 
that just amazes me . 
what amazes me even more is that we on this side let them stand up and get away with it . 
they talk about the huge deficit they had and the financial mismanagement that was there when they came to power . 
it is interesting to note every success they have had . 
i do not deny they have had success in terms of balancing the books , but the question has to be how they balanced the books . 
that is the question . 
they turned the rig around for sure but on policies we brought in when we were in government . 
in fact most of them over there were elected on that . 
anyone over there elected in 1993 was elected on the false promise to eliminate the GST . 
it is quite interesting that I would mention this point . 
it is past history but it is very relevant because on the CBC radio program Cross Country Checkup , hosted by Rex Murphy , the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions as a guest panellist responded to some of the phone calls coming in from across the country . 
that would simply blow away every inch of financial success they have had on that side of the House . 
they won the election on the big untruth . 
i know I am not allowed to use the word lie , but they won that election on the big untruth . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. member is not unfamiliar with skating on thin ice . 
this time he went a little too far so I would ask the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest to withdraw the term lie . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly will withdraw that term . 
in terms of the thin ice I will be like the minister . 
when the junior minister of finance admits on national radio that they cannot get rid of the GST and that the success they had is because of it , it reveals exactly how thin the ice is they are skating on over there when they are talking about their so - called financial success . 
there is probably only one member over there , the member for Burin - St. 
George ' s , who would agree with every word I am saying . 
he campaigned on this basis in 1997 . 
anyway I think the truth lies in the numbers and lies in the record . 
i want to examine three or four big issues . 
one is free trade which that side railed against . 
i am talking about financial sector deregulation , transportation deregulation and energy deregulation as in the elimination of the national energy program to benefit western Canada . 
they have to stand on their hind legs and talk intelligently about what they inherited . 
it was not the horror show they love to talk about . 
every time they get up it is quite interesting that the debt goes from $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion . 
this time next year the debt they inherited will be up to at least $ 65 billion or $ 70 billion . 
it just keeps growing and growing . 
as the story prolongs it gets more exaggerated . 
i am proud of what we attempted to do and what we will be able to do when we take over that side of the House . 
i will entertain questions from my learned friends on the other side of the House . 
i look forward to it . 
hon. Diane Marleau ( Sudbury , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , speaking of thin ice , the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest was a member in the House . 
actually he sat on this side of the House with the Mulroney Tories when I was a member of parliament in opposition . 
it is pretty thin ice when he starts criticizing Liberal members on what we have been able to do with the mess the Conservatives left us when they were over here for nine years . 
it gets more and more difficult to believe he actually is telling us that we did not do a good job in balancing the books . 
all the Conservatives spoke of for nine years was about what terrible financial shape the country was in . 
i am an accountant by trade and there was something I really believed . 
i really believed the Tories were good accountants . 
can one imagine my shock when I became a member of the government and realized not only did they just talk but they were terrible accountants ? 
there was a huge debt with which we were saddled after hearing about how fiscally responsible the Conservatives were . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , this is really fun because we sat on the finance committee together many years ago . 
obviously the hon. member was much younger then and time has erased many of those memories . 
free trade has been the biggest success story in Canada and one of the reasons that Ontario is leading the pack in terms of economic development and prosperity . 
she campaigned against free trade and swallowed herself whole in 1997 . 
she campaigned on NAFTA and swallowed herself whole . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. member for Egmont . 
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , hon. member was saying how great the previous government was . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
we know what that spells . 
some hon. members : 
liberal , Liberal . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not say whether it was a small l or a big l , so be careful before you stand on your feet and cut me off . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
i want the member for New Brunswick Southwest to clarify the Conservative Party ' s latest stand on free trade as a result of having David Orchard in its party , the anti - free trader . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I guess I would have to ask the member from that party where he stands on the UA . 
every party is always plagued with a problem or two . 
that might be an intellectual hurdle over which some people will have trouble jumping . 
i guess that is the fun of politics . 
the definition of politics is the art of the impossible . 
sometimes we all have to practise the art of the impossible . 
what does amaze me is the hypocrisy coming from the Liberals on the other side of the House in claiming any kind of financial success in terms of managing the economy when they have yet to bring in a major initiative to address the future of Canada in the life of their governments going back to 1993 . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was greatly pleased with the major policy thrusts of the Canadian government as set out in the Speech from the Throne by her Excellency the Governor General and later in more detail by the Prime Minister . 
the focal point of this vision we wish to share with our fellow citizens is quality of life ; it will be the main thrust of our activities as a government and must be constantly at the centre of our daily concerns . 
the concept of quality of life is a hard one to define clearly . 
the International Society for the Quality of Life Studies defines quality of life as the result of interaction between social , economic , environmental and health factors affecting human and social development . 
for many Canadians , however , it is clear that the concept of quality of life cannot be confused with the concept of standard of living . 
our fellow citizens see a marked difference between the two concepts and do not attach the same value to both . 
quality of life is not measured solely against our objectives and successes on the economic level . 
it is , of course , important to have a healthy economy . 
without one , we would find it impossible to make strategic choices for improving our quality of life . 
equally important , if not more important , however , to Canadians is the fact that quality of live involves human investment , that is in health , education and skills development and in our children . 
in fact , economic growth and an improved standard of living must involve good social programs and good social policies . 
what do our fellow citizens want , then ? 
they want to live in a country where quality health care is accessible . 
they want to live in a country where all children can receive not just a basic education but one that will prepare them for the realities of the 21 st century . 
they want to live in a country where all of us can improve our quality of life by improving our skills . 
they want to live in a country which understands that children are our greatest asset and which has chosen to invest in their development . 
they want to live in safe communities with green spaces , where their health will not be threatened by a deteriorating environment . 
Canadians want their government to achieve a consistent balance between social and economic objectives . 
they want their government to understand these needs and to be able to meet them in a concrete fashion . 
our government understands that message . 
this is why it has chosen to make the improvement of Canadians ' quality of life the central theme of its vision for the years to come . 
however , investing in social programs alone is not enough . 
our investments must be in strategic areas , they must be targeted . 
they must achieve the objectives that we set for ourselves as a society . 
while it is relatively easy to measure economic results , it is more difficult to establish social performance indicators . 
how do we measure quality of life ? 
a number of factors may give some indication , including life expectancy , the quality of one ' s physical environment and the crime and poverty rates , but other factors are subjective . 
for example , how do we measure social exclusion ? 
in the coming months , therefore , we must work to improve our performance indicators . 
i should point out that , for the first time , the report on departmental performance that is to be tabled in a few days will include a number of social indicators . 
the government is driven by a will to improve the quality of life of Canadians and has made a number of commitments regarding strategic investments , which include , of course , economic investments , but also social ones . 
we are investing in our young people and in our children , because they are tomorrow ' s adults . 
we hope to provide them with the best possible start , both from a family and an educational perspective . 
we are also investing in families through various tax measures that will allow them to better meet the needs of their children . 
the government also supports various sectors through research . 
investing in research and development will allow us to remain competitive and to continue to develop state of the art technologies . 
we will also strive to ensure Canadians get the best possible care and a healthier environment . 
we also want to provide Canada with modern infrastructures , so that our country is ready to meet the challenges of the new century . 
clearly , we will work on modernizing physical infrastructures , and it is my firm intention to initiate quickly the dialogue that will enable us , by December 2000 , to provide clearer details of this new program . 
if Canada is to affirm its prosperity in the context of global trade , it will have to have the means to do so , that is , ensure transportation safety , protect the environment and encourage tourism and telecommunications . 
the list could be long and will , no doubt , have to be shared with other public or private partners . 
writers and artists are recording our heritage in the archives of history daily . 
we must give them the means to do so . 
as well , new technologies lend themselves to all sorts of innovations . 
it is up to us to discover how to use them to reduce the huge distances between people across the country . 
the immense possibilities offered by the information highway must be mastered and put to use . 
it eliminates distances and thus opens to all who dare previously impassable trade borders . 
this is why the government wants to develop in all sectors a new infrastructure program in co - operation with our provincial and private sector partners . 
this , clearly , involves strategic investments for the future . 
our government intends to build on our successes . 
the previous infrastructure program enabled us to revitalize our economy in several key areas . 
the next one will enable us to equip Canada with all the tools it will need to remain competitive and on the leading edge of economic and social development . 
with the budget surplus we can consider making strategic investments that will help us in meeting our objective of improving the quality of life for Canadians . 
let there be no misunderstanding . 
we are not talking about wasting the gains that have been so dearly paid for . 
each investment will be carefully assessed in terms of its effectiveness , its relation to our needs and our ability to pay for it . 
we must never lose sight of the fact that we are talking about taxpayers ' money . 
in recent years our government has asked the people of Canada to make the necessary and sometimes difficult sacrifices so that we could restore the health of our public finances . 
while the time has come to reap the benefits of our collective efforts , it is also clear that the government is committed to never returning to the days when we put ourselves deep into debt . 
never again will we live beyond our means . 
before going any further , allow me to quote the Prime Minister : " Today I have set out a comprehensive strategy , for people , for opportunity , for excellence , for success , for a high quality of life , for sharing , dignity and mutual respect , for creativity and innovation '' . 
simple logic holds that this strategy which centres on the quality of life applies to everyone without exception , including government employees . 
as a public sector employer , it is incumbent upon us to attend to the development of what is undeniably the greatest asset of any government , the public service . 
it is time to reaffirm our commitment to our employees . 
everyone , public service employees , carpenters and musicians alike , need to feel appreciated for their efforts and in the work they do . 
our employees are the representatives of the government , the very government that imposed budget cuts , that took away what had been gained , that demanded sacrifices , that caused belts to tighten . 
it was often our employees who dealt with the public who had to face the backlash from angry Canadians . 
a better quality of life for the people of Canada will have a twofold impact on our government employees . 
they too will benefit from the overall improvement in addition to being granted greater recognition for their work by a public that has been reassured . 
i will of course see to the well - being of our public service employees ' needs through the Government of Canada ' s overall strategy . 
i will also see to it much more directly through the implementation of a series of new measures throughout the public service . 
improving the way in which we deliver our services to the public is obviously a commendable objective , but we must have the means to do so . 
that presupposes that our public service is properly equipped and it will be . 
we will modernize our public service . 
we will renew it . 
we will tailor our management to the needs of the next century . 
in Canada we want to create an exclusive public service , but time is of the essence . 
almost half of our public service employees are over the age of 45 . 
i reiterate my personal commitment . 
we will start by providing stimulating work in a positive environment . 
we must recognize and acknowledge the importance of front line staff in the delivery of services to the public . 
we will recruit the best and most outstanding employees . 
we will do everything we can to make sure that our public service regains the prestige once associated with it . 
the Public Service of Canada , similar to those countries emerging from major transformations taking place throughout the world , will be less cumbersome , more technology based and , as a result , more alert . 
this will benefit everyone : the employers through better performance , the public through more efficient services , and the employees through acknowledgement of their work and the resulting sense of personal satisfaction from a job well done . 
naturally , the primary responsibility for this transformation lies with the federal government , which is well aware of the needs of its public service . 
i realize that our union partners may be skeptical of these commitments by the government . 
i can only reiterate my firm desire to undertake the necessary discussions we will need to have on the methods to be used to meet our mutual objectives in an atmosphere of partnership and dialogue , not confrontation . 
by the end of our mandate , when the application of the measures announced has taken shape and when the new quality of life has made itself felt in Canadian homes , the federal government will regain its place at the top of the list among employers of choice . 
we will have a modern , efficient and motivated public service that will be able and happy to assume responsibility for the destiny of the Canada of tomorrow . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
there is nothing to put an end to the arrival of boatloads of immigrants on the west coast . 
there is nothing to put right the terrible unfairness in EI , for which barely 42 % of unemployed workers who pay premiums qualify when they lose their job . 
there is nothing to narrow the gap between rich and poor , which grows wider with each passing year . 
i wonder whether the minister , the President of the Treasury Board , was one of the 500 people who marched in Montreal yesterday to try to make people , especially rich people , aware of the terrible straits in which several hundreds of thousands of Canadians find themselves . 
with many , many children coming to school hungry every day , donations must now be sought so that they can be provided with breakfast and lunch . 
when the minister talks about the quality of life and the environment of Canadians and Quebecers , can the minister tell us whether or not she intends to do something about these oversights in last week ' s throne speech ? 
i await her comments . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard : 
in a throne speech , we look at where we have been , where we are now and where we are going . 
canada is far from being a perfect place . 
there are still some major problems . 
we talk about improving the quality of life and not only the standard of living - and we must make a distinction here in that the quality of life also implies looking at the social aspect of life in our society . 
this is what matters . 
when we talk about improving the quality of life , it means improving the welfare of families , children and any person living in Canada . 
poverty levels in this country are clearly unacceptable . 
that is why , for example , the Speech from Throne shows that we have a vision for the future with regard to families and children . 
this is a clear commitment to help children , to give some people a chance to break free from poverty . 
moreover , the throne speech leaves the door open for further improvements . 
our government ' s commitment to improve the quality of life of Canadians says it all . 
we recognize the fact that our country is great compared to others , but we still have to work together to improve the quality of life of Canadians . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be brief , but I would like to ask my colleague a few questions . 
she says that the Liberal government has done a good job in the past six years . 
i do not know where she was , because in the Atlantic provinces , the Liberals have lost nearly all their seats . 
so what about all these young workers and women workers ? 
if there are 800,000 workers who do not qualify for employment insurance , how many hungry children does that create ? 
the number of food banks has gone up 10 % more in recent years . 
where do the children fit in here ? 
where has the Liberal government been these past six years ? 
it has merely been following in the footsteps of the Conservatives , who started the employment insurance cuts in 1986 , and the Liberals are just continuing them . 
if the minister does not believe this , let her leave Ontario and Quebec and come to New Brunswick and the rest of the Atlantic provinces to see what is going on , to see how people are having trouble making ends meet . 
when I went across Canada on my employment insurance fact - finding tour , that is what I found . 
women do not quality for employment insurance if they have worked less than 700 hours in a year . 
the change the minister is proposing is a minimal one . 
i would like her comments on this . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard : 
Mr. Speaker , I also said in my presentation today that , if we have come this far in Canada , it is because we asked huge sacrifices of Canadians , not just workers but all Canadians . 
in 1993 , when we were faced with an incredible debt , a $ 42 billion deficit and a stagnant economy , what did we have to do ? 
we had to put in place a very restrictive plan for the use of all our resources and we had to make major cuts . 
the public was behind us , it was supportive . 
now , I do not think Canadians would ever again allow a government to accumulate such a huge deficit . 
so , Canadians agreed with our initiatives and they are the ones who made these sacrifices . 
there is no question about that . 
in spite of these circumstances , we were able to get the economy going again and keep our inflation rate very low while maintaining interest rates at an acceptable level . 
the national unemployment rate has gone down and we have managed to preserve social programs , although they had to be redefined . 
clearly , that redefinition of our social programs affected some groups more than others . 
this is why the government , in its throne speech , demonstrated its commitment to making investments wherever necessary . 
the impacts of our employment insurance reform were significant , because that was a comprehensive reform . 
we are currently looking at these impacts with a view to making improvements . 
Mr. Yvon Godin : 
yes , three times . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard : 
now that we have a budget surplus , we want all Canadians to benefit from it , first through a tax reduction and , second , by making strategic investments to help those groups that need it most , whether in eastern Canada , in Quebec ' s Gasp é Peninsula or in western Canada . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
i even made a list about aboriginal issues for the previous minister on the other side . 
it has messed it up and left it to the courts . 
will prison reform be in the throne speech ? 
will that long overdue issue be addressed ? 
will the age of sexual consent be addressed ? 
both the Liberals and the other crew down there had a lot to do with that a few years ago and in fact reduced the age of sexual consent from 16 to 14 . 
will it be changed back to 16 ? 
will the real issue of taxes , a real commitment on taxes , with timelines , be addressed ? 
taxes were mentioned but the timelines were not , the legislation was not and the details of the legislation were not . 
in most cases anything that was even generally addressed in the throne speech would have to be turned into legislation . 
most of us know that it is probably less than two years before the next election . 
as House leader I can say that turning these general commitments into legislation before the next election is not going to happen . 
so much for commitment . 
what about the old Young Offenders Act , now called the Youth Criminal Justice Act ? 
the Liberals changed the name but will they make commitments on when it will be changed and what will be changed in it ? 
i believe this is now the fourth , count them , throne speech in which the government has mentioned those changes , yet we see no changes . 
what about the airline industry issues ? 
i have spoken many times in the House about what some of the problems are with the numerous appeals and on and on it goes . 
will they be addressed ? 
how about the issue of the Senate ? 
will we ever see a reformed Senate ? 
how about some substantive details about how we are going to fix the unity issues ? 
the defining moment came for me when I read the document which was really a rhetorical PR piece . 
we know that essentially it will take legislation and the courage of all of us in the House to change things . 
i can say that legislation will not be forthcoming , at least not to the point where it receives royal assent . 
they may play with it but it is not going to happen . 
the other issue I want to talk about is drugs . 
about seven months ago the Liberal government came out with a national drug strategy document . 
i did some checking . 
i compared their national drug strategy with the national drug strategy of the Liberals . 
lo and behold , I sincerely believe both were written by the same person . 
i took the Liberals ' document to many places across the country , from downtown east side Vancouver to small cities across the country , Nova Scotia included . 
i asked them to look at this national drug strategy and to tell me how it affected them . 
they told me that it was a waste of their time and mine , that the strategy was no good and not effective at the street level . 
unfortunately a few comments were made in the throne speech . 
i think it was primarily because the Reform Party has been nagging the government on this for some time . 
i come from an area which has 15,000 addicted people , many who are young teens . 
this is just one area in our country . 
go to Toronto , Ottawa or small towns . 
there is no commitment . 
i talked to some ministers who said that they gave $ 5 million to British Columbia after the opposition parties nagged them . 
they threw out $ 5 million over a period of two years . 
this is petty cash . 
the Liberals do not say that the drug issue is a health issue . 
they say it is an issue and they will fix it by throwing some money at it . 
they have long past given up the idea of being upset about it . 
they have long past given up the idea of thinking this is the place to resolve problems . 
i look at a blueprint , a model , a plan called a throne speech and I can see that we have a government with status quo in mind . 
don ' t worry , be happy , things are working right . 
we will get into the spotlight . 
we will tell all that it is working great . 
we want something done about drugs . 
we want something done about child pornography , prisons , the age of sexual consent , aboriginal problems , taxes , crime , young offenders , the airline industry , the immigration and refugee system , the Senate , free votes . 
if we get around to trying to fix that , we will find that perhaps unity will be somewhat resolved . 
but that takes courage and I am not sure the government has it . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the hon. member ' s comments particularly with regard to the lack of substance in the throne speech . 
he mentioned child pornography , immigration , a whole bunch of justice issues . 
i have been in this House since 1993 and I have come to the conclusion that the government does not have the will to do what it was duly elected to do . 
by that I mean the government wants to be politically correct . 
any of these issues that are of any moral or justice substance the government wants to pass on to the courts and I strongly disagree with that . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , this concept is very near and dear to the hearts of most Canadians . 
who actually makes laws in this country , the elected people , the representatives from all over the country in this place , or the judges appointed by the government of the day ? 
that is a valid question . 
there was never any question in my mind about who it should be . 
it should be the elected officials . 
the difficulty I have is this delegation of authority . 
it is not my fault , it is their fault '' . 
at the same time it has not issued accountability within those areas it has delegated to . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with some intent to the hon. member opposite . 
i want to ask him two questions . 
the first question is I wonder what he thought there was to gain by bashing the judiciary ? 
the second question I have is that the hon. member spoke about running for parliament and being around to do the right thing in terms of caring for the country . 
is he planning on doing that the next time , or is he going to jump ship and seek provincial politics ? 
i would be really interested in answers to both of those questions , the honour of the judiciary and where his commitment lies in terms of parliament vis - à - vis the provincial political arena . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know what this jumping ship is . 
rumour has it that I am running for the Liberals in B.C. Give your head a shake . 
to answer the more serious question of the two , it is interesting with those fellows over there . 
if a person speaks out about and issue and thinks he is right about it , for instance , a judge says that the possession of child pornography is legal and a person speaks out about that , or a judge like Howard Weston in Manitoba who says that all federal penitentiary prisoners - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am sorry , but some months ago we had already agreed that we were not going to mention specific judges . 
we can refer to the judiciary , but not to judges specifically . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , if an individual , in particular people in this House , disagree with that , the Liberals call it bashing instead of articulating what one believes in . 
if an individual dislikes what is going on in any portion of the immigration proceedings , and I have had lots of experience trying to get criminals deported from this country , they call it racism . 
the problem is that those individuals over there have no argument to articulate other than " You are bashing , you are bashing , you are bashing '' . 
that is sad . 
perhaps they should learn a little more about what they are supposed to be talking about before they put legislation in place . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin my intervention in this debate by welcoming the new human resources development minister . 
this is a huge area . 
i have been the critic in this area for quite some time . 
i know this minister is committed to doing a good job . 
i will certainly commit to helping her with the best advice I can give on how to carry out her responsibilities . 
the second session of the 36 th Parliament and the throne speech which opened it were the subject of more hype and convenient leaks than in any previous session in my time in this place . 
in recent weeks we had media carrying many interviews with cabinet ministers and all sorts of insider leaks promoting the expectation that the government had an imaginative plan of vision for the future of Canada as we enter the next century and the next millennium . 
with the opening of parliament delayed by three whole weeks for the government to get this just right , we all waited with bated breath for this wonderful vision to come forward . 
what happened ? 
the throne speech contained the usual Liberal feel good rhetoric and much less actual content than was expected even on the big centrepiece , the children ' s agenda . 
there is no clear vision as we enter the next millennium . 
the theme of the Prime Minister ' s speech when he followed up in the House was emotive jargon : hope , confidence , optimism , working together , boldness of vision , courage to act , best country in the world , et cetera . 
he reiterated all of the usual bromides : society of excellence , strong , united , dynamic , innovative , diverse , cohesive , sharing , every child gets the right start in life , young people with a chance to grow , access to skills , quality health care ; all of the things that nobody in the House , let alone the whole country , would disagree with . 
what was missing was one single , solitary , cohesive plan with specifics on how to achieve these wonderful things that we all want for our country . 
this is the lack of leadership that we suffer from in this country : a Prime Minister without specifics , simply falling back on platitudes . 
another commentator said the speech shows the government as being " bereft of vision '' . 
even the normally Liberal - friendly Toronto Star noted that the speech was full of platitudes and short on specifics . 
we need a sound vision in this country . 
we need some specifics . 
where are we going ? 
what is it going to cost ? 
where is the money coming from ? 
what will be the benefits to people ? 
there was none of that , just some nice emotional words . 
to top it all off , the Prime Minister had the nerve to call all of this the Canadian way . 
it is the Liberal way . 
it is the Liberal way of muddiness and fuzziness and murkiness and feel good rhetoric , without delivering the sensible , sound , specific plan this country needs . 
what is the Liberal way ? 
it is bureaucratic meddling ; intrusive government ; Ottawa knows best , especially how to spend our money ; no hope for workers to keep more of what they earn , but instead they can expect to keep half of what they earn ; no liberation from excessive taxes ; more and more of the nanny state , a model that has failed over and over across the world ; and no vision for the future that would appeal to our best and brightest young minds . 
what is the Liberal agenda ? 
after all of the words , after all of the speeches , we do not really know for sure . 
all we can do is examine their past behaviour , their past record of missing the obvious . 
remember , it was these Liberals who were opposed to free trade , the only thing practically that is carrying our economy today . 
would anybody in this House like to have his or her income cut by 98 % ? 
would there not be a hue and cry for something to be done ? 
there was not a mention by the government on how to deal with these people in crisis across our country . 
what about immigration ? 
what about defence ? 
we have a military that is literally falling apart and falling out of the sky . 
there was not a word about how to restore the pride that we used to have in our forces . 
there is violence in a country like Canada : people against people , citizens against citizens , community against community . 
the Liberals are totally out of touch with Canadians . 
Canadians want less government , not more . 
they want to keep the money they earn . 
they do not want to have to turn it over to government , which then says " Have we got a program for you '' . 
these programs simply do not cut it for the majority of Canadians . 
if Canadians were taxed less , they could have a whole range of choices . 
taxes are the business of government . Parenting is not . 
if this government truly wants to help Canadian kids , it should ease the tax burden on parents . 
we need flexibility and choices as parents and as citizens of this country , but no , the government wants to take our money , put us into its little box , its little program and it will decide what we can choose . 
that is not the way to run a good country . 
that is not tax relief , except to a Liberal who wants to say one thing but do the total opposite . 
what about health care ? 
health care transfers have been cut . 
cash transfers are still over $ 4 billion a year below what they were when the government took office . 
that is $ 4 billion that should be going into health care services in the country which the Liberals have taken out and not returned . 
the government talks about wanting to help our children . 
look at its track record on that . 
ask aboriginal children how well the government has looked after them . 
many of them are living in poverty and squalor , and they lack services . 
what about military families who are getting by on subsistence wages with substandard housing ? 
the government is totally responsible for the wages and housing of our military and their families . 
what about farm families , children who are losing their entire heritage while the government stands by without a word ? 
what about the children whose parents have hepatitis C from the ineptness of government ? 
they cannot do a lot of the things they need to provide for you and your future . 
too bad , you lose '' . 
that is how the government looks after children . 
i have already mentioned health cuts . 
how do they impact parents and children ? 
yet , the government has the nerve to say it cares about children and families when everything it has done in the past shows completely the opposite . 
we need a plan that will really carry us into the future , with something solid that we can count on and something that really gives us choice , flexibility and a bright future . 
that plan was enunciated in the House by the Leader of the Opposition in a speech that had the substance that this tired , sad , incompetent government failed to deliver . 
i commend to all Canadians the plan we have put forward , which would give real choice , flexibility , freedom and the protection of family resources and the resources for which we all work so that we could build the future we want together . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to my colleague for Calgary - Nose Hill . 
i thought she gave a very thoughtful analysis of the throne speech . 
i see some commentators have taken to calling this the drone speech rather than the throne speech in that it lacks a vision for our country entering a new millennium . 
i thought my colleague said it pretty well , but I am really interested in her analysis of the government ' s 50:50 proposal for spending our so - called surplus . 
i would like to find out where my colleague stands on the whole issue of 50:50 . 
in my mind it sounds good . 
however , I think the Canadian public are being fooled into thinking that 50 % will go toward new spending and 50 % will go toward the reduction of the debt and the massive tax burden in this country . 
in fact , we are finding out that basically there is no surplus to split 50:50 . 
i would like to have her analysis of that situation . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy : 
our money is burning a hole in the pocket of the government . 
it thinks of wonderful new ways to spend it , like sending young people across the country who are trying to get an education , some skills training and looking forward to a stable job with a decent income . 
it thinks of feel good programs instead of the substance that our country needs . 
then the government says " We are going to spend half of your money for you because we know better '' . 
the real question for Canadians is , do they want government spending more and more of their money ? 
or , do they want to say to the government that it is spending enough , that it needs to put some of the money it has been spending on wasteful , frivolous things back into key programs like health care , solid education for our children , proper salaries for our military and addressing the real problems of this country ? 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I commend the hon. member who mentioned the children on reserves , the lives they are leading and the squalor and poverty that exist . 
we always look for explanations , and I am sure that she does not have any . 
i know I do not . 
i would like her to comment on why in the world a government that has been in power for the length of time that this government has would continually ignore the auditor general ' s statements which blasted the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development for its lack of accountability in looking after these matters . 
why does the government continually ignore that ? 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy : 
i believe that the government cares more about its image , its legacy , about politicking and feel good words than it really does about doing something serious , practical and specific for the people of this country . 
the hon. member for Wild Rose is one who knows very well that when it comes to delivering , the government gets a big fat zero . 
Ms. Yolande Thibeault ( Saint - Lambert , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for Chatham - Kent Essex . 
as we all know , my role as Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole limits my interventions in this House to procedural matters . 
naturally , however , I want to begin by thanking my constituents in Saint - Lambert , to whom I owe the great privilege of sitting in this place . 
my riding consists of four large municipalities : 
Greenfield Park , Lemoyne , which is celebrating its 50 th anniversary this year , the western portion of the city of Longueuil and , finally , Saint - Lambert , which gives my riding its name . 
as is the case with many urban ridings in Canada , contrasts abound between and within these four municipalities . 
they are essentially suburbs of Montreal - what are often referred to as bedroom communities - where the quality of life takes precedence over industrial activity . 
the proportion of anglophones , francophones and new Canadians also varies widely in the municipalities contained within the riding ' s boundaries . 
the gap between those whose circumstances are improving and those for whom , on the contrary , they are worsening , also exists in my riding . 
at the close of the century , with the effects of globalization and technological innovation increasingly transforming not just relations between countries but also the daily lives of all citizens , I feel we must pay special attention to the life of the community . 
in fact , I believe that one of the vital roles of the governments of today , as well as of each and every member of this House , must be to work toward the economic and social integration of all those who are at risk of being pushed aside in a competition - , innovation - and knowledge - based economy . 
in this context , the situation of the homeless is a particular concern . 
it is true that this is a problem that is hard to get a proper handle on . 
there is no typical homeless person , although we are too often tempted to lump them all in together without thinking . 
in reality , all homeless people have their own stories , their own experiences , their own lives . 
they may be children abandoned by their parents , ruined businessmen , battered women , aboriginal people who have not managed to integrate into big city life , refugee claimants , or people who have been released from correctional or psychiatric institutions and are having difficulties fitting back into society . 
people end up on the street for all kinds of reasons . 
among the main causes of homelessness are : mental illness , family violence , addiction , poverty , loss of income , less affordable housing , and migration to major urban centres . 
in Ottawa , our nation ' s capital , an estimated 4,500 people including 375 families with children are homeless . 
as a matter of fact , the fastest growing group of homeless is families with children , and 18 % of the homeless population of Ottawa are children under the care of single parents . 
in the street , all suffer in the same way , young and old , university graduates and the functionally illiterate , members of our first nations and recent immigrants ; all are discriminated against in the same way . 
what almost all of them have in common is the fact that they did not choose this lifestyle and cannot change it unaided . 
i take great pride in being part of a government that has set itself the priority of improving the quality of life for all Canadians . 
in particular , we set up several programs specifically for the homeless . 
however , these measures could lose their effectiveness and end up being too scattered if they were not all co - ordinated by a single minister . 
fortunately , the Minister of Labour and federal co - ordinator for activities related to the homeless displays remarkable energy and sensitiveness in dealing with this delicate and complex task . 
the Canada - wide tour that she did this summer to consult stakeholders shows that she is taking that responsibility very seriously . 
when the governor general read the throne speech last week , I was very pleased to hear her say that " the Government will continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the root causes of homelessness '' . 
however , even a government with the best of intentions , or all levels of government working together , can never solve the problem of homelessness without the support of the whole population . 
homelessness is a societal problem that must absolutely be dealt with by society as a whole . 
it is imperative that we develop common approaches and initiatives with all public administrations , community groups , educational institutions , the private sector and everyone who wants to contribute to the betterment of their community . 
as Canadian citizens we are justly proud of our first place ranking in the United Nations human development index , but such classifications are meaningless for the individuals who struggle every day to find something to eat and do not know where they will be sleeping at night . 
over the years successive Canadian and provincial governments have achieved much , more than most countries in fact , to provide Canadians with an effective and affordable social safety net , but we still have a very long way to go before coming to grips with the problem of homelessness . 
homelessness is growing in number and diversity at an accelerated pace . 
all Canadians are about to celebrate , in their own way , the arrival of a new century and a new millennium . 
this is an opportunity for us to proudly celebrate a remarkable past and to look confidently to a promising future . 
on the occasion of my first speech in this house , I am making the wish that , during these celebrations , we never forget that thousands of our fellow citizens need us in an urgent and critical way . 
there are of course no homeless people in this house . 
however , each and everyone of us here represents some of these people in the Parliament of Canada . 
the homeless , as well as all those who live in need and uncertainty , are also Canadian citizens . 
they too are entitled to a brighter future . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member spoke about the problem of homelessness . 
she made a very eloquent and good case for concern for the homeless . 
it is a very important issue that must be dealt with . 
she also mentioned that she is pleased to be part of a government that made the statement in the throne speech that it would continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the root causes of homelessness and to help communities respond to the needs of their members for shelter and other support . 
other than that sentence I did not see anything concrete to tell me what the government is actually doing to help those people who are living on the streets and who were so aptly described by my hon. colleague . 
would the member comment on what practical steps she sees the government taking to provide a housing program , or something which will address the issue in a very concrete fashion ? 
Ms. Yolande Thibeault : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his kind comments . 
indeed the Speech from the Throne was not very specific on the provisions the government intends to take to try to solve the problem . 
as I mentioned in my speech , the Minister of Labour travelled widely throughout Canada last summer . 
we will receive her concrete suggestions in the very near future . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I too listened to our colleague ' s speech . 
the problem with the government is that it talks a lot but does nothing . 
first , there was the appointment of the minister for the homeless , an appointment without portfolio . 
then employment insurance . 
i would like our colleague to tell us what this government , which she so strongly believes in , intends to do or should do if it really wants to help the homeless in the country , not only in words but in deeds . 
Ms. Yolande Thibeault : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for his remarks . 
the Prime Minister has already taken a big step by asking a minister to take on the problem of the homeless . 
this is a relatively recent problem . 
it is new in the scope it has assumed in recent years . 
i remember watching American television programming on street people and reading reports in American papers about them , like many of you . 
we thought the Americans had a problem and one that we would not want here . 
unfortunately , however , it has arrived here now , and I am sure , with all the work the Minister of Labour is doing at the moment , we will have results very soon . 
in any case , I hope so and I hope we will have the co - operation of all the members of this House as well . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
CANADIAN FORCES 
Mrs. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) : 
throughout Operation Persistence the 46 team members drawn from across Canada provided over 7,500 hours of forensic dental services that were crucial in identifying many of those lost in this tragic mishap . 
they performed superbly under extremely demanding and emotional circumstances that required a special kind of fortitude , stamina and emotional strength . 
few of us can imagine the trying circumstances under which these personnel served . 
on October 12 , the chief of defence staff presented a Canadian forces unit commendation to members of the team in an official ceremony that recognized their exemplary actions . 
i would now ask all members of the House to join me in acknowledging the fine work performed by these dedicated people . 
* * * 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , how can Canadians trust the Liberals when they say they will protect children and then avoid positive action on the possession of child pornography ? 
child pornography is a serious crime and in response on Friday 300,000 Canadians voiced their community - centred approach through a petition against child pornography insisting the government defend the law . 
in response , the justice minister accuses Reform members of being scaremongers . 
obviously the minister does not feel obligated to the community will , and also has no ability to get cabinet approval for action . 
children are the most vulnerable members of society and they deserve the fullest protection of the law . 
liberal sentiments delivered in regal fashion do not close legal loopholes or defend families . 
the poor Liberal justice system will only be improved when the system defenders are replaced by the system changers in the opposition . 
* * * 
YWCA 
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October 17 to 23 is the YWCA ' s fourth annual Week Without Violence . 
each year the YWCA holds activities across Canada that help to raise awareness about violence in our communities and its impact on all of our lives . 
last year local activities and initiatives touched over 20,000 individuals . 
this year ' s focus on youth is expected to touch even more lives . 
i would like to extend my congratulations to the YWCA for its ongoing efforts on behalf of all Canadians . 
i would particularly like to congratulate the YWCA of Cambridge for its ongoing dedication to making our community a better and safer place to live . 
i would encourage all Canadians to participate in local activities during this year ' s Week Without Violence . 
* * * 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Nobel Peace Prize for 1999 has been awarded to M é decins Sans Fronti è res . 
founded in 1971 by a group of French doctors and now active in 80 countries , including Canada , M é decins Sans Fronti è res provides direct , in the field medical help to victims of armed conflict , without regard to political allegiances . 
the committee of the Norwegian parliament which chooses the laureates has normally favoured national political leaders but it has also recognized non - profit , humanitarian organizations . 
the International Red Cross has been honoured three times , beginning with the first award to the Swiss founder , Henri Dunant , in 1901 . 
the Nansen committee and the later UN High Commission on Refugees have also been recognized three times . 
the Institut de Droit International was an early laureate in 1904 . 
very recent recipients have included the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1985 , the Pugwash Movement for Nuclear Disarmament in 1995 and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines in 1997 . 
the award to M é decins Sans Fronti è res continues this contemporary trend of recognizing the role of volunteer , grassroots , private citizens ' organizations in advancing world peace today . 
* * * 
women ' S HISTORY MONTH 
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October was designated Women ' s History Month by the federal government in 1992 to celebrate the past and present contributions of women in Canada and to recognize their achievements as a vital part of our Canadian heritage . 
October was chosen because of the historical significance of the Persons case . 
on October 18 , 1929 , after a lengthy political and legal battle led by five Canadian women , the British Privy Council declared that the reference to persons in section 24 of the British North America Act did indeed include women , thus making them eligible for appointment to the Senate . 
today marks the 70 th anniversary of the Persons case decision and the 20 th anniversary of the Governor General Award in commemoration of the Persons case . 
may we congratulate the five Canadian women who will receive this year ' s Governor General Award . 
these remarkable women have followed in the footsteps of the famous five of 1929 and the 107 other Governor General Award recipients since 1979 . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a recent Angus Reid survey shows 46 % of prairie farmers are seriously considering getting out of farming or have already ceased operations because of high taxes , unfair foreign subsidies and low commodity prices . 
by the end of this year , thousands of farmers will be forced from their farms , not by choice , but by this government ' s inaction and lack of interest . 
unless the government takes immediate action to resolve the farming crisis , our farmers face a bleak future . 
the Prime Minister continues to boast about Canada being the best place on earth to live . 
i wish he would face a group of Canadian prairie farmers and make that statement . 
but true to form , the Prime Minister and his government will continue to avoid addressing this very important issue . 
* * * 
child TAX BENEFIT 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi - Baie - James - Nunavik ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , according to Michel Girard , a journalist for La Presse , the Government of Canada increased the child tax benefit by $ 15 a month effective last July 1 . 
this represents an additional $ 60 million in assistance to families in Quebec . 
but only $ 10 million of it actually made its way into their pockets . 
the government of Lucien Bouchard decided to cut its provincial allowance by $ 50 million . 
of the 660,000 families in Quebec that receive the family allowance and the federal benefit , only 103,800 saw their income go up following the federal increase . 
what did Quebec City do with the $ 50 million it netted by cutting its provincial allowance by the same amount as the federal increase ? 
it put it into day care services . 
today , the government of Lucien Bouchard is cashing in on children ' s benefits . 
* * * 
CANADIAN HANDBALL TEAM 
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last July , four young members of the Canadian handball team from Drummondville took the gold medal at the UBAE grand prix in Barcelona and placed fourth in La Coupa Interamnia in Teramo , Italy . 
Martine G é linas , St é phanie Gagn é , Catherine Brunelle and Marie - Christine G é linas surprised everyone , because they have only been playing this sport for two years . 
in addition to maintaining a rigorous training program and keeping up their studies , they had to find the money to pay for their trip . 
it would be a good idea if Heritage Canada were to provide basic funding to all sports federations to assist athletes . 
the unflagging support of their trainer and their parents played a vital role in the young women ' s success . 
their outstanding determination deserves our recognition . 
bravo to all four , and good luck in the next competitions . 
* * * 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with great privilege and honour that I pass on 80 th birthday wishes to Canada ' s 15 th prime minister , the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau . 
first elected as a member in 1965 , Mr. Trudeau served as minister of justice under the leadership of Prime Minister Pearson . 
a dashing , charismatic politician , he was elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1968 and in April sworn in as Canada ' s 15 th prime minister . 
during 16 years of Trudeaumania , he reformed Canada . 
the government passed the Official Languages Act , fought the separatist terrorists in Quebec during the October crisis and introduced the metric system in Canada . 
he was devoted to national unity in opposition to the separatist goals of the Parti Quebecois . 
* * * 
breast CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the pink ribbon I am wearing today represents breast cancer awareness month . 
this serious illness devastates vast numbers of women across Canada . 
let me note some positives in this field . 
new genetic research now allows us to detect the gene in some families where the risk of breast cancer is predictable . 
this opens up preventive steps and surely prevention is better than treatment . 
regular self - examination , new diagnostic technology and early intervention are all positive developments here in Canada . 
in my work as a doctor , I have seen personally the tragic effects of breast cancer . 
i wish to pay tribute to the efforts of health professionals and volunteers , who are working to reduce the incidence and the terrible consequences of this serious disease . 
* * * 
international DAY FOR THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday was the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty . 
the objective of eradicating poverty , on which efforts must be focused every day , is an important part of our concerns if we wish to provide everyone with an improved quality of life . 
eradicating poverty must also be among the concerns of all governments , all organizations and all corporations . 
each of us has a duty to help the most disadvantaged members of our society . 
let us hope that , with the new millennium fast approaching , each of us will be able to say that we have personally contributed to this objective , this societal necessity , of eradicating poverty as quickly as possible . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , by now most Canadians are aware of the crisis facing our non - native and native fishermen in Atlantic Canada . 
since the Marshall decision was handed down by the supreme court , the fisheries are in a state of confusion and fishermen are angry at the lack of leadership shown by the Liberal government . 
i now understand why the government is negligent in its responsibility to thousands of fishermen and their families . 
it is , I believe , so that the DFO can institute the individual transferable quota system known in the fisheries committee as ITQs . 
please do not institute the ITQ system on lobster stocks . 
* * * 
doctors WITHOUT BORDERS 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Friday , the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization Doctors Without Borders , which has been providing international medical assistance for the past 28 years . 
since then , Doctors Without Borders has been involved in humanitarian endeavours in an impressive number of conflicts and disasters , in particular the war in Lebanon in 1976 , the terrible famine in Ethiopia in 1980 , the earthquake in Armenia in 1988 , and most recently the war in Kosovo . 
as one of the founders said recently " After nearly 30 years of activities , we are not sure that speaking out always saves lives , but we do know that silence kills '' . 
our heartiest congratulations to Doctors Without Borders for its contribution to the ideal of peace and the elimination of suffering in the world . 
* * * 
madam JUSTICE LOUISE ARBOUR 
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like the house to congratulate Louise Arbour , who was born in Montreal , who is the former prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal , and who is now a supreme court justice . 
madam Justice Arbour received the highest honour at La Presse ' s 16 th excellence gala , when she was named personality of the year . 
she also won the award in the " courage , humanism and personal accomplishment " category . 
all agree that under the leadership of Louise Arbour , international justice took a giant step . 
indeed , Louise Arbour showed unprecedented determination in prosecuting people suspected of war crimes all over the world . 
she did a great job in conditions that were sometimes unstable and very difficult . 
canada and the whole world are grateful to Louise Arbour for having shown such leadership in issues as complex and difficult as those of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia . 
international peace and justice are greatly indebted to her . 
congratulations to Louise Arbour and to all award winners at the gala .

fisheries 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past weekend hundreds of non - native fishers and their families converged in Yarmouth to express their anger over the federal government ' s handling of the fishing crisis . 
despite the minister ' s claim of having a solution in hand on Friday , we discovered there was no such solution , which was why he had to appoint an independent negotiator . 
west Nova fishers have very little faith in the government ' s ability to find a solution to this crisis . 
why should they ? 
the minister of Indian affairs said that we were overemphasizing the crisis . 
after all , winter was setting in , not many people would be fishing and nobody ' s livelihoods are at stake . 
for his part , the fisheries minister said that he wants a long term solution before the next fishing season in the spring . 
why will the government not take the crisis seriously and immediately implement short term solutions that would at least see all fishers respect pre - established fishing seasons in the name of conservation ?

women ' S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October is Women ' s History Month . 
this year , Women ' s History Month pays special recognition to the contribution of francophone women in Canada ' s history . 
one francophone woman who is making history today is Julie Payette , the first French - speaking Canadian female astronaut . 
Julie has been accumulating honours and awards of excellence since college . 
although her formal education is in science and engineering , her contribution to the arts is also noteworthy . 
she is an excellent pianist and has sung with a number of choirs both in Canada and abroad . 
furthermore , Julie speaks French , English , Spanish , Italian and Russian . 
in June 1992 , the Canadian Space Agency selected her as an astronaut and four years later she began training as a mission specialist at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston , Texas . 
this past May , Julie Payette climbed aboard the space shuttle Discovery and headed for the International Space Station . 
the success of her recent 10 - day mission on the shuttle Discovery and at the International Space Station is a source of pride for all Canadians . 
she is also an inspiration to young women across Canada , encouraging them to follow their dreams in pursuing careers in non - traditional work . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
taxation 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government ' s first act of the new millennium will be to raise taxes . 
on January 1 , Canada pension plan premiums will rise by $ 2.3 billion and bracket creep will pull hundreds of thousands of Canadians into higher tax brackets , which is not exactly a cheery way to enter the new year . 
we now have poverty groups , family groups , small business associations and even the banks calling for a substantive tax cut . 
why is the government to start the new century with a tax hike instead of a tax cut ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the preamble to the hon. member ' s question is totally false . 
we will be starting the new millennium with tax cuts . 
however let us deal with the issue of the Canada pension plan . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister is avoiding the issue . 
the statements in the Speech from the Throne about tax relief are half - truths . 
over the same period that the government promises $ 16 billion in tax relief it increases taxes by $ 18 billion for a net increase in taxes of $ 2 billion . 
i ask the government again why it is starting the new millennium not with genuine tax relief but with a tax hike . 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once again the hon. member simply does not know the facts . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister has notes in his margin that say " argument weak , yell like hell '' . 
the facts are these . 
when workers look at their paycheques the taxes are increased , not decreased . 
when a mother looks at her family budget at the end of the month she has less money to spend because of the minister ' s taxes and not more . 
businesses are going to the United States and not staying here because of the tax policies of the minister . 
why after six years of broken promises should Canadians believe the minister when he says that now he will decrease taxes ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I guess Canadians should believe the government because we know the facts and the hon. member obviously does not . 
real disposable incomes in Canada have not only stabilized but now for the first time in over a decade they are beginning to rise . 
the hon. member is wrong . 
unemployment in the country is now at its lowest level in over 10 years . 
if the hon. member would like to see a perspective on the Canadian economy and the net result of what the government has done , I would simply ask him to look at the Royal Bank report which came out today . 
it basically says that the country is cooking on all cylinders . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know if the country is cooking on all cylinders but I do know that taxpayers are getting roasted thanks to this finance minister . 
he should listen to his own finance department . 
he always talks about reducing taxes but all of his actions are to increase taxes . 
if the finance minister really has the courage of his convictions , why will he not eliminate bracket creep on January 1 ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member simply ought to take a look at reality . 
the reality is that our tax cuts have taken care of bracket creep and much more . 
it behoves us then to offer a polite nod of thanks in the direction of the federal finance minister '' . 
i hate to say it , but that is what he said . 
he goes on to say , for all the lecturing Ralph Klein did in the mid - 1990 s about how Ottawa needs to get its budgetary books in order like we did at the time , Klein and Day have been left in the dust by Ottawa . 
that is the Calgary bunch . 
the Speaker : 
i remind hon. members not to use any props in questions or answers . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it will be noted how the finance minister always runs away from the question . 
for someone who is pursuing the leadership of the Liberal Party that is not a great quality . 
i suggest maybe he wants to focus on the question this time . 
if he really believes in tax relief , why does he not begin with a tax cut on January 1 ? 
why will he not eliminate bracket creep ? 
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
a substantial increase of $ 1.8 billion in the child tax benefit , that is money that will be found in the pockets of middle and low income Canadians with children . 
the fact of the matter is that taxes have gone down every year since we have balanced the budget and they will keep on going down .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Friday , the Minister of Canadian Heritage said in this house that she did not know that members of her staff or of her department were aware of the investigation into CINAR , a Montreal production company . 
a few minutes later , she told the media that her deputy minister knew about the investigation . 
given that she had the whole weekend to do so , the minister must surely have checked things out . 
could the minister confirm that no other person from her department or from any organization accountable to her department was aware of that issue ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Friday , I said just about the opposite of what the hon. member is claiming . 
i said that my office had no information on this issue and that I presumed that my department was aware of what was going on , since it had already arranged for a meeting with the police . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
i hope he will let the RCMP conduct its investigation and shed light on the whole issue , instead of saying falsehoods here in the House . 
the Speaker : 
i ask everyone to be very careful with their choice of words . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
in view of the links that appear to exist between the chairman of the board of Telefilm and one of names used by CINAR , is it the minister ' s intention to give Telefilm such a mandate ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have already asked the RCMP to investigate . 
i think the RCMP is capable of investigating all the names , all the alleged names and all the people implicated in the matter . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the police themselves are calling for an administrative investigation to complement their own investigation , and the minister does not seem to be aware that people in her department or in agencies responsible to her could have links to this matter , how can she claim that this matter will be fully brought to light ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is precisely because of the allegations made last week that I took responsibility for requesting an RCMP investigation . 
* * * 
bill C - 80 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 200 food safety scientists have sounded the alarm today . 
they are warning that our government is not able to ensure the safety of our food and that the whole food safety system is in jeopardy . 
the scientists are especially worried about Bill C - 80 , the proposed food marketing bill , that it will further erode our ability to ensure the safety of our food . 
my question for the health minister is simple . 
will the government abandon this dangerous bill ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me respond to that part of the question dealing with the food safety employees of Health Canada . 
i did indeed receive a letter from them last week . 
one of the first things I did when I got there was to cancel the proposed cuts to the food directorate . 
we have $ 65 million from the most recent budget to improve food safety . 
we are continuing with the recommendations of the science advisory board - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister and the government are so concerned that they are prepared to throw the do not harm principle right out the window . 
the scientists are coming to the minister and to the public because they have deep concerns . 
they do not believe what he has just said . 
they have said we are in a disastrous situation and we are on a perilous course of action . 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the scientists are of course right to express concerns they honestly feel . 
i am responding to them as I am responding to the hon. member by saying we are both on the same side of this issue , which is the side of consumer safety and safety of food . 
so long as I am minister the scientists at Health Canada will have the resources and the mandate required to ensure that safety .

agriculture 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week the minister of agriculture in a CBC interview said he would use all the resources at his disposal to help farmers . 
when will the minister use his influence to put forward similar resources to help stop the bleeding in agriculture ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have already demonstrated that in that we have already put $ 900 million into assisting farmers . 
i think farmers are very glad that we formed the government because the hon. member ' s party platform last time said that they would merge the agriculture , environment , natural resources , and fisheries and oceans ministries . 
the projected savings they said they would make in Agriculture and Agri - Food Canada would be $ 600 million . 
we put $ 900 million in and they wanted to take $ 600 million out . 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the provinces where Canada delivers the AIDA program they have delivered $ 90 million to date . 
to date , 8,000 AIDA applications have been approved and 10,000 have been denied . 
does the minister not believe that those 10,000 farmer do not need assistance ? 
if he does believe that then when will he give them some hope and put some money in their pockets ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s statement about how much the AIDA program has delivered already is incorrect . 
to four provinces where the federal government delivers the program it is now well over $ 200 million . 
last fall the hon. member ' s party said that it believed the emergency assistance could be delivered at a cost to the federal government of approximately $ 276 million . 
that is all it said was needed . 
we are putting in $ 900 million , over three times what it said was needed . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a lot of us are alarmed at the increasing level of friction and tension in the east coast fishery . 
today we learned that the West Nova Fishermen ' s Coalition is going back to court to do what this government should have done all along , which is to apply for a stay of judgment in the Marshall decision to allow first , for a cooling off period for everyone involved and second , to give time to determine the future role of non - aboriginals in the fisheries . 
will the government support their appeal to the court which asks for a stay and a clarification of the Marshall decision ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
we said that we would live within the spirit of that judgment . 
in fact , there was a meeting this morning with chiefs from Atlantic Canada to look at how we can move on the process . 
my colleague the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is continuing to meet with them to see how we can look at the broader implications and continue that discussion so we can have a long term solution on this issue . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fishermen want a clear answer to this question . 
during last week ' s emergency debate on this fishery , the Liberals joined with the NDP and Conservative Party in refusing to consider a stay of judgment . 
this past weekend we saw the result of that bullheadedness . 
there is increasing friction with hundreds of boats in the harbour and potential for violence hanging over everybody ' s head . 
this is the last day to apply for a stay of judgment , which I repeat , will allow for a cooling off period and clarification of the Marshall decision to establish what the roles are for both aboriginals and non - aboriginals in the future fisheries . 
will the government support the West Nova Fishermen ' s Coalition application for an appeal of the Marshall decision ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it should be pretty clear to everybody in the House that it is better to negotiate than to litigate . 
that is our position . 
we want to negotiate . 
we want to make sure that we sit around the table . 
we have always said it is through dialogue and co - operation that we are going to get the real solution , not through going back to the courts , not through asking that we have another look at the supreme court ruling . 
we have a supreme court ruling . 
we will recognize that right . 
we will live within the spirit of that judgment .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Canadian Heritage has just told us that she requested an RCMP investigation into the copyright case . 
will she confirm that there had already been an RCMP investigation into this case prior to 1997 and that no charges were laid ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not comment on RCMP investigations . 
on Friday , further to allegations made in the media and by the opposition member , I requested an RCMP investigation . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to make things perfectly clear , the minister requested an RCMP investigation . 
but an RCMP investigation was conducted prior to 1997 . 
we do not know why , or how , but no charges were laid . 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I cannot make any comment about an earlier RCMP investigation . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the agriculture minister still is not willing to admit that thousands of farmers will not get any AIDA money out of this government . 
a year after Reform forced the government to debate the farm income issue in the House , only 30 % of Saskatchewan farmers have received a federal cheque . 
why can this government not get emergency assistance to farmers who fell through the AIDA cracks , and do it before the end of October ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows full well that the government responded very early to the issue . 
we have had discussions and are continuing discussions with the farm safety net advisory committee , with my provincial colleagues and with my cabinet colleagues . 
we have responded to the issue . 
we are directing as much support as we possibly can to those farmers who are under financial stress . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the problem is the program has not worked . 
the agriculture minister has failed to deliver on his December 1998 promise to get cash to all financially stressed farmers in time for the spring planting . 
premier Klein has his $ 100 million plan that includes disaster relief and low interest loans . 
the farmers in Alberta will get their money immediately . 
why will this government not follow the Alberta lead and use disaster relief and low interest loans , those two things specifically , to provide immediate assistance to farmers ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
federally we are treating the producers in every province that meet the criteria of the aid program exactly the same .

employment INSURANCE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the former Minister of Human Resources Development showed an absolute lack of sensitivity to the problems women are having with the employment insurance program . 
is the new minister going to act promptly to correct the unacceptable situation deplored by the Canada Labour Congress ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is referring to a study by the Canadian Labour Congress which will not be published until next month so it is hard for me to comment on the statistics or data . 
but there are data which we are all very proud of . 
the most recent labour market data say that Canada ' s unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in nine years at 7.5 % and the unemployment rate for women is the lowest it has been in 20 years . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government ' s intentions relating to parental leave as they are set out in the throne speech put the proposed changes off until 2001 . 
how can the minister accept such a distant date , and why will she not act now to correct one of the major injustices toward women in the employment insurance reform ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am thrilled to hear the Bloc supporting a very important initiative announced by the Prime Minister last week , which is that we will double parental benefits by 2001 . 
that will give parents 12 months to spend at home with their children . 
it will be flexible .

young OFFENDERS 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 861 days is how long we have been waiting for the justice minister to introduce new young offenders legislation , 861 days . 
there is another bill coming and another chance to get it right , but who knows how many we have to see . 
in the meantime over 30,000 violent crimes have left more than 30,000 victims in their wake . 
that is about 34 violent crimes a day . 
why will the justice minister not simply admit that the YOA is DOA and do something to fix it ? 
Mr. John Maloney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member should know , we have already introduced the criminal youth justice bill again . 
it is to be considered by the committee in the very near future and dealt with accordingly . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is going to hold the record for trying to bring in legislation . 
it can keep bringing in bill after bill but the point is this has not been fixed . 
the justice minister has had a choice . 
she has been in office for 861 days talking about this marvellous new solution . 
it is not happening . 
she can blame the official opposition or any scapegoat she chooses but the problem has not been fixed . 
will she go down in history as the minister who actually brought young offenders to justice or in the name of prevention , allowed for thousands of new victims that should never have been there ? 
Mr. John Maloney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have introduced the bill . 
as a result of that report , we have new legislation which will be dealt with expeditiously by the government . 
we are moving forward on this issue .

hepatitis C 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , at a press conference this morning , an important coalition comprised of the F é d é ration des infirmi è res et des infirmiers du Qu é bec , the Quebec section of the Canadian Hemophilia Society and the young activist Joey Hach é called upon the government to compensate Hepatitis C victims . 
since this is the government ' s constitutional responsibility , what is keeping it from showing the victims some compassion ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Canada has already earmarked more than $ 1.3 billion for people infected by hepatitis C . The Government of Quebec has already accepted our proposal to share $ 300 million just for those infected outside the 1986 - 1990 period . 
to me and to the government , this is a fair and appropriate approach . 
* * * 
health 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health . 
last Friday the government tabled its response to the report of the Standing Committee on Health on organ and tissue donations in Canada . 
after media reports and comments made by the Reform Party health critic over the weekend , can the minister clarify whether the government has closed the door to the national registry of organ donations ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I read with some disappointment the comments by the Reform Party health critic . 
what we announced last Friday is very important for a number of reasons . 
first of all , it was the first time that all governments of the country agreed to work together to make increasing the organ donation rate a national priority . 
second , we formed a national council to help make that happen . 
the provinces very importantly have agreed to invest the kind of money needed to do what is really important which is to put teams in hospitals to counsel those who are the relatives of the dying to encourage the donation of organs . 
that is going to make a real difference .

prisons 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask about a resort that has been brought to my attention called Frontenac Institution . 
do not let the fact that this is a prison fool you . 
here are some of the highlights in the brochure which I received . 
has the solicitor general completely dropped the principle that a prison should be about work ethics or even punishment or is he simply trying to compete with Florida ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in our correctional system we have minimum , maximum and medium institutions . 
when a person is convicted , Correctional Services Canada evaluates the offender . 
this is done for public safety reasons . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wonder whether they want to break out or break into this place . 
i ask the solicitor general why should law - abiding Canadians continue to serve time paying high taxes while inmates at Frontenac prison are sent on extended vacations fishing and golfing ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this summer I visited a number of institutions across Canada . 
i know my hon. colleague does not want to mislead the public . 
i can assure everyone that being in a minimum penal institution in this country is not a resort . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
i urge member to please listen to the responses to the questions which are posed . 
it makes question period much easier for all of us . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay : 
Mr. Speaker , quite simply what my hon. colleague has to realize is that most offenders come from the community and will go back to the community . 
what Correctional Service Canada does , with public safety being the number one issue , is to make sure that these people are ready to return to the community . 
* * * 
national PARKS 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible national parks , and I believe it is the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
i am sure that the minister will be concerned about reports today that the panel on ecological integrity in Canada ' s national parks appears about to report that the national parks are in serious trouble , that the ecological integrity principle that the parks are supposed to be managed on is not being applied consistently , and that scientific talent is thin in the parks . 
there are a number of very serious descriptions of the malaise in the national parks . 
what new measures is the minister planning to take in order to deal with this obviously serious situation ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for his question and , in particular , his interest in the results of the ecological integrity panel . 
in fact , the government actually launched the ecological integrity panel review as a result of the findings of the Banff - Bow Valley report , which basically pointed out how parks are at risk ecologically when they spend too much time on commerce and not enough on scientific analysis . 
when we receive the final results of the ecological integrity report , which we expect by the end of December , we want to work co - operatively with all the players to make sure that we put science first in Canadian parks . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we struck the panel the reason I personally sought out the participation of Jacques G é rin was because he is the former deputy minister and is known and respected by people concerned with ecology around the world . 
we believe that we need an ecological template for all of Canada ' s national parks . 
the Banff - Bow Valley study was a wake - up call , a wake - up call that we intend to apply by ensuring that ecological integrity is the number one clarion call for every park in Canada .

immigration AND REFUGEE BOARD 
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this month Ms. Mawani , the chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board and a friend of the minister , completes her term . 
this seven year appointment will outlast the mandate of this government and will have to oversee the implementation of a new immigration act . 
will the minister commit today to involving the citizenship and immigration committee in the selection process of candidates instead of naming just another well - connected Liberal friend ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for the question because it gives me an opportunity to correct the record . 
Ms. Mawani has served for 10 years as chair of the IRB . 
the House will note that this government was elected for the first time less than 10 years ago . 
it is true that her appointment is coming to an end and that there is a review under way for a successor . 
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is the minister ' s opportunity to keep at least one election promise , an open and accountable government . 
maybe the minister will let the committee do this job as parliamentarians working within a parliamentary democracy for a change . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would also like to point out to the hon. member that I had the opportunity to meet Ms. Mawani for the first time shortly after my appointment , when we discussed , appropriately , the procedures and policies of the board , which is an arm ' s length , quasi - judicial institution . 
i want to say to the hon. member and to all Canadians that competence is the first criteria with this government ' s appointments .

natural RESOURCES 
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources . 
quite recently I attended a meeting at Nepean City Hall where a number of citizens expressed concern about the safety of transporting a MOx fuel sample through their communities . 
what is the federal government doing to address these concerns and to ensure that those who live along the transportation route will not be subject to unnecessary risk ? 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
a proposed testing of a very small amount of plutonium oxide is fully governed by Canadian laws to protect health , safety and the environment . 
let me emphasize that this is a test only . 
with respect to transportation , plans have been published , local officials have been briefed , public open houses have been held and a 28 day public comment period has just concluded . 
transport Canada will review all of that input to satisfy itself that the public interest is properly safeguarded .

health 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the health minister has rejected the standing committee ' s recommendations to establish a national registry for organ transplants . 
the minister ' s office said it did not have time to fully explore the financial implications of such a proposal . 
that is not unusual for the minister when it comes to setting up registries . 
his gun registry is already 300 % over budget . 
can the minister tell us whether the $ 275 million his government has spent on a gun registry would have been better spent on an organ donor registry that would actually save lives ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member can always be relied upon to get his facts wrong , always . 
it is no surprise that he would ask the question he has just put . 
we have accepted those recommendations . 
we are working to achieve them . 
the provinces have agreed that it will happen . 
by November we will have a working plan to make sure it does . 
once again the Reform Party is completely out to lunch .

INDIAN AFFAIRS 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Indian Affairs intimated last week that the Marshall decision went beyond the issue of fishing rights for native peoples and included all natural resources , namely forestry , the gathering of wild fruits and the extraction of natural resources . 
my very simple question is for the Deputy Prime Minister . 
is the government ' s position the one put forward by the minister ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is meeting with the aboriginal communities from Atlantic Canada right now . 
we are doing what we said we would do , which is to have a dialogue and make sure that we talk . 
the supreme court ruling clearly said that there is a treaty right for fishing , for gathering and for hunting . 
we respect that right . 
now we need to make sure that we get around the table and start working with the parties that are affected , including the provincial governments , to come to a long term solution .

Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the minister responsible for homelessness if she thinks we will face another winter of deaths on the streets because of a lack of action by her government on housing . 
after her cross - country tour Canadians have a right to know what she will recommend in her report and why her report is not public . 
after all the fanfare last spring the government now seems intent on clawing back people ' s expectations . 
what are her recommendations and what action will the government take to end homelessness ? 
hon. Claudette Bradshaw ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I have explained to the hon. member on several occasions , the responsibility that the Prime Minister gave to me was to co - ordinate the issue of homelessness because of all the reports that were coming in to our offices . 
it is not a task force report . 
what the staff and I are doing is taking all of the recommendations that were received and I will be presenting to caucus and to our members the recommendations I received through reports coming in as well from my trip . 
i have to say that the support I received from cabinet and caucus members - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Chicoutimi .

health 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health . 
the cuts in health care have created totally unacceptable problems . 
could the minister tell us whether the fact that people are obliged to wait two , four , six and eight weeks for operations is in accordance with Canada Health Act ? 
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to remind the hon. member that , a few months ago , in the budget for this year , we increased transfers to the provinces by $ 11.5 billion , and the provinces promised that the additional funds would be used for health . 
it is now up to provincial health ministers to use this money and to reorganize health care services to ensure that the services are available to the public .

endangered SPECIES 
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) : 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to assure the hon. member that the endangered species legislation or species at risk legislation will be brought forward during this session . 
i trust it will be passed before June of next year . 
it is critical that this legislation include provisions for habitat because habitat is the critical factor for probably 75 % of the endangered species recovery program . 
without the habitat we do not have the species . 
i can assure the member that we will be bearing her remarks and her proposal in mind when this legislation comes forward .

justice 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last week in the House the solicitor general declared : " Fighting organized crime is the number one law enforcement priority of the government '' . 
the Canadian Police Association recently referred to organized crime in Canada as an epidemic . 
if fighting organized crime is the number one priority of the government , can the solicitor general please explain why it spends hundreds of millions to register shotguns owned by duck hunters rather than improving public safety by giving the RCMP the resources it needs to fight organized crime ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated , and I am pleased my hon. colleague is well aware , this government has indicated that it will give the RCMP the tools to do the job . 
for example , we gave CPIC $ 115 million to make sure it was brought up to date . 
we put $ 18 million into a DNA databank . 
i am very pleased the opposition has come to realize that this government is fighting organized crime .

CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has known since at least last March that it must appoint a new CEO of the CBC , the most important cultural institution in Canada and in Quebec . 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister . 
does the minister agree that , for the good of the CBC , it is imperative that a transparent selection process be put in place to pick this important cultural steward and that competence be the sole criterion ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , an appointment will soon be made and I hope that the hon. member will be satisfied with our competence - based appointment . 
* * * 
natural DISASTERS 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Co - operation . 
last month at the time of the devastating earthquake in Taiwan , many countries , including the United States , Germany , Japan and Russia immediately sent search and rescue teams . 
why did the Liberal government refuse to send Vancouver ' s respected urban search and rescue team both to help in the rescue and to get badly needed experience ? 
and , why did the Government of Canada not strongly refuse China ' s outrageous interference with the delivery of humanitarian aid at this time of need in Taiwan ? 
hon. Maria Minna ( Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , aid to Taiwan was not affected at all by China . 
with respect to the issue of search and rescue , directly supporting development of the search and rescue team has not been part of CIDA ' s practice in the past . 
however , as the new minister I have actually reviewed this policy .

the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that this bill is in the same form as Bill C - 69 was at the time of prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament . 
accordingly , pursuant to order made Thursday , October 14 , 1999 , the bill is deemed adopted at all stages and passed by the House .

recognition OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 224 , an act to establish by the beginning of the 21 st century an exhibit in the Canadian Museum of Civilization to recognize the crimes against humanity as defined by the United Nations that have been perpetrated during the 20 th century . 
second , this bill was previously introduced in the last session of parliament as Bill C - 479 . 
i am reintroducing it in this session of parliament . 
i also take this opportunity to thank the millions of Canadian who supported the bill throughout the last 10 months . 
i hope to have their support again in the coming months while we pursue the bill all the way through to third reading . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

tobacco ACT 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 225 , an act to amend the Tobacco Act ( substances contained in a tobacco product ) . 
i hope to have the support of members of parliament this time around so we can introduce the bill and label it as the tobacco act . 
it asks parliament to add each and every substance contained in a tobacco product so smokers can see and read what poisons they are inhaling as they smoke . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
parliamentarians ' CODE OF CONDUCT ACT 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 226 , parliamentarians ' code of conduct . 
the purpose of this enactment is to establish a code of conduct for members of the Senate and the House of Commons and to provide for an officer of parliament to be known as the ethics counsellor to advise members , administer disclosures of interest and carry out investigations of complaints under the direction of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

organ DONATION ACT 
Mr. Lou Sekora ( Port Moody - Coquitlam - Port Coquitlam , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 227 , an act to establish a national organ donor registry and to co - ordinate and promote organ donation throughout Canada . 
the bill would provide the legislative response needed to address the demand for a national co - ordinated organ donor system in Canada . 
the lack of available organs in the country results in unnecessary loss of lives , loss of quality of life and many needy recipients . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
CANADIAN TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND SAFETY BOARD ACT 
Mr. Speaker , with the extreme growth that has taken place in interprovincial and international highway transport in the last few years , there is a serious gap in safety regulations with respect to very large vehicles . 
any accident involving heavy interprovincial vehicles is now investigated only by the province in which the accident took place , unless the province makes a special request to the Transportation Safety Board to become involved . 
the bill would require the Transportation Safety Board to have authority over any accidents occurring involving large trucks and buses in interprovincial and international service . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
canada POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 229 , an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act ( letter that cannot be transmitted by post ) . 
during the last session of parliament this bill was known as Bill C - 409 . 
bill C - 409 is an important piece of legislation as it protects the Canadian consumer from telemarketing mail scams . 
it will ensure that the Canada Post Corporation does not deliver contests , lotteries or prize cards that require individuals to pay out before they are able to claim their prize . 
the bill will also regulate the use of logos that mimic federal government logos . 
before the House prorogued , Bill C - 409 was about to receive its first hour of debate at second reading . 
this legislation has not been altered in any way since prorogation . 
i trust it will resume its place on the order paper . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that this bill is in the same form as Bill C - 409 at the time of prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament . 
accordingly , pursuant to Standing Order 86 ( 1 ) , the order for the second reading of this bill shall be added to the bottom of the list of items in the order of precedence on the order paper and shall be designated as votable .

national EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA AWARENESS WEEK ACT 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 230 , an act respecting a national epidermolysis bullosa awareness week . 
the bill seeks to designate the last week in October as National Epidermolysis Bullosa week or , as it is known , EB week . 
by doing so it hopes to raise awareness of this very rare and debilitating genetic disease . 
in addition , we hope to encourage both public and private investment in research , development and treatment and to find a possible cure . 
this disease is characterized by fragile skin and recurrent blisters that cause affected individuals and their families severe physical and emotional pain and suffering as well as financial hardship . 
we hope that the bill will not only bring awareness to the disease but that we also learn about the disease , learn how to pronounce the disease or in short to call it EB disease .

internet CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. Speaker , before I introduce the bill I wish to send congratulations to my hon. colleague , the Attorney General of Saskatchewan , Mr. Chris Axworthy , who originally introduced this bill but then left . 
the purpose of the bill is to protect our children . 
the Internet is an explosive new material in terms of media . 
it has a very negative side in terms of attracting innocent children into the hands of pedophiles . 
pedophiles are using the Internet now as a tool in order to coax our young children into very obscene acts and in many cases into death . 
the purpose of the bill is to protect our children and those unsuspecting in the country from the powerful use of the Internet by incorporating the users of the Internet and governments , provincially and federally , to institute laws and legislation to protect our children from the evil effects that the Internet can have on them from the pedophiles of the nation . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

hepatitis AWARENESS MONTH ACT 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 232 , an act to provide for a Hepatitis Awareness Month . 
the disease of hepatitis inflicts over 600,000 Canadians in the country . 
although we have months recognizing breast cancer and other ailments which inflict our citizenry , I believe , after working with those with hepatitis in Nova Scotia , Mr. Bruce DeVenne , and Mr. Joey Hach é here in Ottawa , that it is time that the Government of Canada and especially us , as legislators , recognize the month of May as Hepatitis Awareness Month . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
income TAX ACT 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 233 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act ( medical expenses ) . 
as baby boomers and people throughout Canada are looking to herbal alternatives to cure what ails them , the bill will enable any licensed physician who prescribes a herbal alternative in lieu of a prescription drug to allow that patient to claim that herbal alternative as a medical tax deduction . 
when I originally introduced the bill , I had thousands and thousands of signatures supporting this initiative . 
i am sure that colleagues on both sides of the House will support this valuable initiative as well . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to bring forward this private member ' s bill again on the suggestion from Bev and Lloyd Bergeson of Cremona , Alberta who lost their daughter Denise to a dangerous driver . 
the bill would amend the Criminal Code and would enable police to take , without delay , any samples required to determine if there is any presence of drugs or alcohol in the urine , breath or blood in the event that there is a death . 
i strongly support the bill on behalf of the family . 
i assume that members across the House would be supportive in taking this kind of action . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
divorce ACT 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 235 , an act to amend the Divorce Act ( marriage counselling required before divorce granted ) . 
the divorce rate in Canada exceeds 40 % and there are over one million common - law families in Canada . 
their breakdown rate is over 50 % higher . 
the bill is compatible with the recommendations of the Joint Commons - Senate Committee on Custody and Access which deals with issues such as shared parenting , mandatory mediation and that children are the real victims of divorce . 
the bill basically hopes that we will have parenting plans in place for children of broken families and also that we address the important problem of post - divorce acrimony . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
national PARKS ACT 
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 236 , an act to amend the National Parks Act , ( Stoltmann National Park ) . 
the forest cover in Canada , despite claims to the contrary by the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association and other groups , is also shrinking . 
it is also declining in value and historical significance because of changes in forest composition after the first cut . 
the bill aims at preserving one of the few remaining old growth forests . 
it is located in the Elaho Valley and known also as Stoltmann Wilderness Area . 
twice in September I visited this forest where rare Douglas fir trees , up to 1300 years of age , grow . 
this unique heritage of ours should be protected for generations to come rather than fall victim to the chainsaw for the benefit of the short term . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

an ACT FOR THE RECOGNITION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS 
Mr. Speaker , it is indeed unfortunate that the government has chosen to abandon the last session of parliament , forcing hundreds of private members ' bills like mine to be reprinted and reintroduced at considerable expense to Canadian taxpayers . 
the bill would strengthen property rights in federal law . 
unfortunately , property rights were intentionally left out of the charter of rights and freedoms , leaving Canadians highly vulnerable to the arbitrary taking of property by government ; legally owned property like legally acquired satellite dishes and firearms . 
my bill would fix this by making it more difficult for the government to override the property rights of its citizens by requiring a two - thirds majority vote of the House . 
my bill also strengthen the property rights provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights by providing protection of our right to have compensation fixed impartially , protection of our right to receive fair and timely compensation and guarantees every Canadian their right to apply to the courts when the government violates their property rights . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
canada POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mr. Speaker , the bill deals with the rural route mail couriers , the people who deliver our mail in the country . 
our point is these are not independent contractors as such , they are wholly dependent on Canada post for all they do . 
therefore , the relationship is more that of an employer and an employee and not an independent contractor . 
however , the Canada Post Corporation Act specifically bars them from bargaining collectively . 
they are not allowed to organize into a union or take part in free collective bargaining . 
we think this is wrong . 
they are the only group of workers in the country who are specifically barred from organizing a union . 
the bill would simply eradicate one clause in the Canada Post Corporation Act and allow them to bargain collectively . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
whistle BLOWERS PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 239 , an act respecting the protection of whistle blowers and to amend the Auditor General Act , the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act . 
we want workers to feel comfortable and free to blow the whistle on these illegal , immoral or unethical things without worrying about losing their job . 
within the bill , the whistle blower would go to the auditor general who would then investigate and find out if it was made in good faith . 
if it was , he would go to the minister in charge and cause an investigation to take place . 
we believe this is long overdue . 
too many workers have been frightened about turning in things that they know to be wrong for fear of discipline in the workplace . 
the bill would look after those workers . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
labour MARKET TRAINING ACT 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 240 , an act to provide for the establishment of national standards for labour market training , apprenticeship and certification . 
we now have 10 different provinces doing different training for one career . 
the bill would introduce national standards for the entrance requirements in all the certified trades , the curriculum and the certification process . 
we would then have continuity . 
we would have a national human resources strategy for labour market training even though it has been devolved to the provinces in such a hurried mishmash that it is no good to the industry and no good to Canadians the way it stands . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
young OFFENDERS ACT 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 241 , an act to amend the Young Offenders Act and to amend certain other acts in consequence thereof . 
i suggest it will have that application as well for the new Youth Criminal Justice Act . 
the bill would lower the age of accountability from 12 to 10 . 
i would urge all hon. members to give the bill due consideration and support . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 242 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( Order of prohibition ) . 
the bill I am introducing is very important for all Canadian children . 
the bill would bring about changes to the Criminal Code , section 161 in particular , and is aimed at children who are the most vulnerable in the country right now . 
it would also empower judges to reduce contact between sex offenders and children . 
in particular , we know there is a difficulty with recidivism of pedophiles and abusers of children . 
on behalf of Miss Golder and all children , I would urge that all members of the House support this important change .

petitions 
cruelty TO ANIMALS 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , members know that before the break I introduced a number of petitions from citizens concerned about cruelty to pets . 
during the summer that has been exacerbated by a horrific example of a dog being dragged by a pickup truck until it was raw and battered . 
on behalf of these petitioners I once again call upon parliament to work toward swift and effective action to modernize Canada ' s laws dealing with crimes against animals and that the penalties for such actions be made strict enough to act as a deterrent against such behaviour . 
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have another petition . 
i have presented similar petitions from petitioners who point out that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is the most important provider of Canadian programs that reflect Canada . 
also the CBC has the unique ability to connect Canadians with each other and to help Canadians discover each other . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to ensure that Canadian old time fiddle music be deemed to be heritage music and be featured on a regular weekly one hour program on our national radio , CBC . 
young OFFENDERS 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure today for me to table this petition containing 2,087 signatures from Okanagan Valley residents who are deeply concerned at the harm caused by young offenders . 
these people call upon parliament to permit publication of names of young offenders in the newspapers and also to make young offenders pay restitution for their crimes . 
the CONSTITUTION 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to present to the House of Commons . 
the first one has some 500 signatures . 
the petitioners pray and petition parliament that parliament oppose any amendments to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or any other federal legislation which will provide for the exclusion of reference to the supremacy of God in our Constitution and laws . 
canada POST CORPORATION 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the second petition the petitioners ask parliament to consider very carefully the removal of section 13 ( 5 ) of the Canada Post Corporation Act . 
the CONSTITUTION 
Mr. Jerry Pickard ( Chatham - Kent Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I present a petition in which several of my constituents are calling upon parliament to uphold the present wording of the Constitution and to preserve the truth that Canada was and is founded upon the principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law . 
several people have commented on this in my riding . 
they are very concerned that everyone take heed of that point . 
i certainly endorse the petition strongly . 
nuclear WEAPONS 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there seems to a rush on petitions today . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to support the immediate initiation and conclusion by 2000 of an international convention which will set out a binding timetable for the abolition of all nuclear weapons . 
clowns AND SANTAS 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton - Springdale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I have the honour to present a petition signed by concerned citizens from my riding of Bramalea - Gore - Malton - Springdale . 
clowns and santas in particular need to be controlled through mandatory background checks since there is currently an automatic assumption by the public that clowns and santas , who often entertain in homes , are safe strangers . 
therefore , the petitioners call upon parliament to encourage mandatory background checks for clowns and santas throughout Canada . 
human RIGHTS 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to present a petition signed by 682 people , many of them students , from central Alberta . 
these constituents are requesting that the Canadian government confront China directly on the human rights abuses taking place in Tibet . 
they are extremely concerned about the issue of China - Tibet relations and ask the Parliament of Canada to pressure China to address this issue . 
treasury BOARD 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to table a petition that was presented to me by my constituents in Kitchener Centre . 
the petitioners request that parliament halt the plans of Treasury Board to appropriate the surpluses in the public service , the military and the RCMP pension plans . 
they also ask that the Treasury Board end all actions that undermine the confidence and morale of the public service , armed forces and RCMP personnel . 
this petition has been certified and I am pleased to present it today . 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am extremely pleased that hundreds more petitioners are talking about cruelty to children that is in the form of pornography . 
the petitioners pray that parliament take all necessary measures to ensure that possession of child pornography remains a very serious criminal offence . 
i am proud that these petitioners may not be the last of hundreds and hundreds of signatures that are coming in from my constituents on this issue . 
gasoline ADDITIVES 
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to present a petition that has been certified correct as to form and content . 
petitioners from the Grand Bend , Port Franks and Thedford areas have signed the petition . 
the petition states that the use of the additive MMT in Canadian gasoline presents an environmental problem that affects every man , woman and child in Canada . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to set by the end of this coming year national clean fuel standards for gasoline with zero MMT and low sulphur content . 
aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to present today . 
the first petition has been signed by 97 Canadians from the Hay River area . 
they request parliament to grant the concerned aboriginal fishermen , the Deh Cho , a licence to export fish and fish products and to establish their own national and international markets . 
adoption OF CHILDREN 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is signed by 39 people in my riding . 
it calls on the government to pass legislation that would provide for a deduction of up to $ 7,000 in expenses related to the adoption of children . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
during the time allotted for the presentation of private members ' bills , a second item listed by the member for Wild Rose was inadvertently missed . 
i ask for unanimous consent to revert to introduction of private members ' bills to allow him to present his private member ' s bill . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent to revert to the introduction of private members ' bills ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to bring forward this private member ' s bill which will amend the Criminal Code regarding dangerous offenders where an inmate may be declared a dangerous offender at any time during his incarceration . 
in the past 10 years a report has been sent out by the solicitor general ' s office indicating that there has been a total of 2,292 new victims of violent crime at the hands of violent offenders who were released from prison either mandatorily or on probation . 
this enactment would prevent the release of such people as Mr. Auger who managed to murder Melanie Carpenter a few years ago . 
it would prevent what is going on this very day in Edmonton where an effort is being made to warn society of another dangerous sex perpetrator who is being released in that city . 
releasing these kinds of individuals does not protect Canadian society . 
this bill would prevent further problems in the future . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

blood SAMPLES ACT 
Mr. Speaker , last year there was a very unfortunate incident in my riding . 
a young man apprehended a thief who was shoplifting from a store and unfortunately quite a bit of the perpetrator ' s blood spilled on him . 
there is no legal way to force that thief to give a blood sample for disease testing . 
for several months afterward the young man and his family went through the emotional anguish of extensive drug prevention therapy just in case there was HIV present . 
it was also a very expensive and a very trying time for the entire family and especially for the young man . 
this bill will eliminate the terrible emotional anguish for good Samaritans who find themselves in similar circumstances in the future . 
the rights of police officers , health professionals and good Samaritans who try to protect life and stop crime must take precedence over the rights of the perpetrators of any wrongdoing .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Gar Knutson ( Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister , Lib . ) :

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
hepatitis C 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i have received a request from the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve for an emergency debate , pursuant to Standing Order 52 . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 52 of the House of Commons , I am asking this house to hold an emergency debate on government compensation for victims of hepatitis C who were infected by blood transfusion in Canada before 1986 and after 1990 . 
the government has always refused to allow parliamentarians to discuss this issue . 
worse still , the Minister of Health has refused to meet representatives of hepatitis C victims , in spite of repeated requests to that effect . 
yet , the Krever commission clearly established that it is in the interest of all Canadians and Quebecers that the blood supply and distribution systems be as transparent as possible . 
members will agree that this need for transparency requires the federal parliament , which is responsible for regulating blood and its constituents , to deal with all relevant issues . 
in that regard , there can be no doubt that responsibility for compensating hepatitis C victims who were infected before 1986 and after 1990 rests squarely with the government . 
the Krever commission also asked the government to set up a no fault compensation plan . 
i attach a copy of that recommendation to the letter I sent to you . 
for all these reasons , I believe it is imperative that we parliamentarians be allowed to debate this critical public health issue . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
notwithstanding the case made by the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , I feel that , at this point in time , his request does not meet the criteria governing emergency debates . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
without questioning your decision , I would just like you to tell me something . 
i believe that if we were to consult Beauchesne ' s , we would find cases quite similar to this one , in which the government rejected a decision made by a royal commision of inquiry . 
i believe there are precedents where parliamentarians were allowed to discuss such issues . 
why , given the case I made , does the chair feel that my request must be turned down ? 
i would like to know the basis of your ruling , with which I will fully comply , but which seems ill - founded at this point . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry the member does not agree with the Chair ' s ruling , but it is not customary to explain why a request for an emergency debate is being denied . 
we will also have , as the member well knows , seven allotted days between now and December , and his party will be free to raise this issue during one of those opposition days . 
i am sure the member can convince his colleagues to have such a debate on one of those days . 
government ORDERS 
speech FROM THE THRONE 
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Jerry Pickard ( Chatham - Kent Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak to the throne speech . 
as we stand before a new century there is a growing sense of optimism , confidence and pride in the country . 
canada is one of the greatest success stories of the 20 th century . 
we began as a small colony with little industry and no real place in global affairs . 
canada is the place to be in the 21 st century . 
we look with pride on the achievements as an independent and prosperous nation with a dynamic economy , a strong and democratic society , and a sense of community , a nation with unrivalled quality of life . 
canada is starting the next century or the new millennium with the honour of being the first ranked country of the United States for the sixth year in a row . 
the Liberal government intends to ensure that Canada remains the best country in the world in which to live . 
when we took office six years ago we put forward a comprehensive and balanced plan . 
we have stuck to that plan and it has worked . 
key programs have been modernized . 
in the last two budgets taxes have been cut by $ 16.5 billion over three years , cuts that will benefit every Canadian and take 600,000 low income Canadians off the tax rolls . 
however , the government remains committed to never letting the nation ' s finances get out of control again . 
according to statistics every billion dollars in exports supports as many as 11,000 Canadian new jobs . 
we will continue to create opportunities for Canadians to access foreign markets and to promote Canada as the ideal place in which to invest . 
we will increase our support for life - long learning to continue building the most highly skilled workforce in the world that is part of the Canadian advantage in a knowledge based economy . 
the government has committed itself to put in place the knowledge information , cultural and physical infrastructure needed for the 21 st century . 
another major focus of our government has been the seven million children in Canada . 
the strength of our society will depend on the investments we make today as a nation for the families and children of tomorrow . 
the federal government will continue to work with provinces , territories and other partners to provide the necessary support . 
the centrepiece of our progress to date is the national child benefit , the most innovative new national social program in a generation . 
thanks to the NCB an additional $ 1.7 billion annually is going to low income families with children . 
the federal contribution will increase to $ 2 billion annually by July 2000 , bringing the total federal assistance for families with children to almost $ 7 billion a year . 
the federal government will make a third significant investment in a national child benefit by the year 2002 . 
we are also proud of the new national children ' s agenda . 
we are developing with the provinces and territories a comprehensive strategy to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children with a special focus on the problems of low income families . 
as part of this agenda we will work with the provinces and territories to reach an agreement by December 2000 on further joint initiatives to support early childhood development . 
the federal government will also put more dollars into the hands of families with children through further tax relief . 
families will also benefit from initiatives that include lengthening and making more flexible the employment insurance benefit for maternity and parental leave . 
in terms of Canada ' s youth our goal is to give the youth generation of Canada , no matter where they live , a shot at personal success in the knowledge economy , a job with the future that pays well and an opportunity at becoming the best and the brightest there are . 
we are committed to helping young Canadians get the skills and opportunities they need to succeed in the 21 st century . 
for example , we have announced the Canadian opportunities strategy , the Canada millennium scholarship fund , the Canada educational savings grant , the youth employment strategy , tax relief on interest payments on student loans , and have helped to connect every public school and library in Canada to the Internet . 
we plan to draw on the expertise as well as the talents of young Canadians to create new Internet access sites in communities across Canada . 
furthermore , we intend to provide thousands of Canadians with the opportunity to participate in Canadian exchange and international internship programs and to volunteer in community and national environmental projects . 
we will work with all partners to help communities meet the needs of their members . 
in particular we will work to eliminate barriers to the mobility of citizens within Canada so Canadians are not denied government services or access to work or education because of the province of their origin . 
we will enter into the new national accord with the voluntary sector that will lay the key foundation for an active partnership with voluntary organizations . 
we will work to ensure persons with disabilities are fully included and we will help new Canadians adapt to life in Canada . 
we will also work to ensure that our communities remain safe . 
that is why the Liberal government will remain vigilant , taking further community based crime prevention measures , to ensure that our communities are safe and healthy places in which to live . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the hon. member who just spoke about the commitment that he has , or that his government has , toward young people , or is the commitment primarily to the banks of Canada ? 
it is particularly with reference to his last comments when he talked about student loans and the privilege that young people have subsidized interest rates on their student loans . 
it is true that while they are attending university or a post - secondary institution of some kind the government pays the interest on these loans to the banks so the student is free from paying them . 
when the student graduates he or she is then obligated to repay the loan at an interest rate exceeding the prime rate in the bank system . 
is the government ' s primary concern about young people , or is the government ' s primary concern to absolve the banks from incurring any risk for these , our most educationally elite people ? 
these people will lead industry in their areas . 
what is the real purpose behind this whole operation ? 
Mr. Jerry Pickard : 
when we stop and think about it , the Canadian opportunities strategy is about helping young people get experience , helping young people work in the environment and helping develop a record of work experience by putting programs in place that allow them to be out in the communities working . 
concerning the educational grants given to students , we certainly are doing the very best we can to make sure there are grants for young people to develop youth environment strategies . 
any type of opportunity where young people get an opportunity to work in programs is very good . 
i think he is suggesting go further , go further , go further . 
that has been the policy of the Reform Party . 
the sad part is that its members say to cut taxes but spend , spend , spend . 
i have heard them today alone suggest 10 policies which in fact - 
Mr. Werner Schmidt : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the hon. member has deliberately misconstrued what I said a moment ago . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that deliberate misconstruction may happen from time to time . 
Mr. Jerry Pickard : 
Mr. Speaker , I clearly remember the hon. member ' s comments . 
he asked " What are you doing for youth ? " 
that is exactly what I am commenting on now . 
the fact is that members of the Reform Party have said time after time , interestingly , " Spend money here ; spend money there '' . 
i could cite specifics , but the fact is that they have asked for tax reductions on one side and they say " spend , spend , spend " in every program . 
the problem is , we cannot do both . 
that is why Canadians have put them where they put them , across the way . 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague for Chatham - Kent Essex made the point that we can look forward to the future with optimism and pride . 
can he explain to the farmers of the Annapolis Valley , especially those who in the last three years have been faced with drought and those who have just in the last three or four years come into business , who cannot take benefit from the AIDA program , how they can have pride and optimism for the future ? 
not supporting these farmers is deplorable and it cannot and should not be tolerated . 
Mr. Jerry Pickard : 
Mr. Speaker , I accept the question from my hon. colleague in the spirit in which it was given . 
there is no question that we must ensure that industry in Canada , be it farming or any other type of industry , gets the proper support mechanisms required . 
there has been a lot of difficulty with the situation in Atlantic Canada , as well as the situation in western Canada . 
we all feel that we must do as much as we can . 
that is why the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food stood today in the House to say that the government had put $ 900 million into trying to bring supports in place for the agricultural industry . 
one has to admit that we are trying our best to handle things in a way that is reasonable and sustainable for the future . 
many of these situations were unanticipated . 
given the opportunity we will develop programs and safety nets that will make certain agriculture is safe in this country . 
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I find it interesting to rise in reply to this throne speech , as this allows us to tell those who are listening to us that , to us , this speech seems drab and empty . 
rather , this speech is an election platform ; most commitments will take effect between 2001 and 2004 , and probably during the next election campaign , which leads us to believe that the Prime Minister will still be there for the next campaign . 
let us consider one example : parental leave . 
everyone wonders why it is not now . 
the money is already there , it is not a problem , so why not start the program up ? 
as hon. members are aware , the funding for this program comes from the employment insurance fund . 
if access to employment insurance benefits is not changed , one may well wonder who will lucky enough to benefit from parental leave . 
first and foremost , October 12 th ' s throne speech is a long shopping list . 
that list includes the government ' s commitment to a slight , long term and conditional tax reduction , to reducing the debt still further , to investing in capital projects , and to creating a broad range of programs ranging from improving the national child tax credit , to home care , to education . 
we are familiar with the Liberals ' promises . 
the numerous promises in the throne speech appear to be just window - dressing . 
we have never been given the real cost of these commitments . 
it is fine to support the homeless in the throne speech , but since 1993 , this government is no longer involved in social housing programs and has not invested anything in them . 
so much , then , for compassion . 
recent years have shown us that government commitments were anything but solid . 
many still wonder about the ability and real desire of the government to honour its commitments . 
other examples come to mind : the GST , pay equity and international aid , for which the government promised to provide .7 % of GDP . 
my colleague , responsible for daycare , tells me that the 150,000 places in daycare that were promised in recent budgets have yet to be provided . 
that said , the fact that the government says it wants to do everything at once is a very clear indication of the fiscal leeway it has this year and of the surpluses that will be distributed in the next budget . 
as they say , they got the bucks . 
however , since they want high visibility as they move into the next millennium , they are offering a sprinkling of new programs instead of going after the real problems . 
what is even more distressing is that these surpluses have been accumulated on the backs of the unemployed . 
there is the $ 25 billion from the employment insurance fund , because $ 5 billion a year accumulates in this fund . 
the cuts in provincial transfer payments have hit the public very hard . 
for the benefit of those listening , I am talking about a $ 33 billion cut . 
then the government wonders why there are health and education problems . 
it makes cuts and crows about the money it is saving , but the provinces are stuck with the unenviable task of running programs on nothing . 
they do not have the money and are having trouble maintaining services . 
it is disgraceful to slough one ' s problems off onto the backs of others . 
they no longer qualified for employment insurance . 
health systems throughout Canada are in terrible shape and the provinces must work hard to avoid the appearance of a two - tier health system , one tier for the rich and one for the poor . 
it is not just Quebec that is facing problems in its health care system , but all the provinces . 
the government would have people think that the problems are limited to Quebec , because of its sovereignist government , but that is not true . 
we must broaden our horizons and look at the other Canadian provinces , which are forced to turn to the United States to provide health care for their inhabitants . 
this from Mr. Charest in May 1997 . 
now that the budget is balanced , it is obvious that the ruthless cuts and overtaxing to which the federal government keeps resorting in spite of the public ' s pleas are giving it more money than it needs , but the government is still avoiding its responsibilities . 
in Quebec , we already have homecare and pharmacare programs . 
therefore , why not give the money to Quebec , to improve what is already in place ? 
i will conclude by saying that instead of using common sense , the Liberals are beginning again to spend money on all sorts of new programs whose only sure impact is to empty taxpayers ' pockets . 
why ? 
this is all in the name of visibility and propaganda , coast to coast . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member talked about , what she coined , our two - tier health care system . 
as far as I am aware , the federal government deals with health through the Canada Health Act , which has the five principles of our health system : universality , accessibility , portability , publicly funded and comprehensive . 
while I understand that anybody can travel to any other country to purchase health care , in Canada that is not the case . 
could the member please clarify her statement ? 
Mrs. Pauline Picard : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not say that we had a two tier system , I said that we were heading that way . 
when transfer payments to provinces are cut by $ 33 billion , including $ 10 billion for Quebec alone , it is obvious that health care is in jeopardy . 
Quebec does all it can to maintain the five major principles of medicare . 
we believe in universality and accessibility and when we are a sovereign country these five principles will be maintained . 
we believe in those principles , but what can a province do when its funds are being cut off and hospital costs are skyrocketing ? 
i remind the House that our population is ageing and needs more health care . 
furthermore , new technologies , like laser treatments and other medical equipment , arre increasingly expensive . 
when Quebec needs more money to buy new equipment and to give health care to an ageing population but its transfer payments are cut by $ 10 billion , how do members think it will be able maintain the five great principles of medicare ? 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the new session opened with a Speech from the Throne , in which the government was supposed to highlight its new policy thrusts during the second half of its mandate . 
since it paves the way for the next election , the throne speech , inevitable , was greatly influenced by the right and the intolerance movement with which both the Liberals and the Reformers seem to be so cozy . 
under these circumstances , political expediency is the rule : public perception prevails over public interests . 
the Reform Party , which has been actively promoting law and order ever since its election to this House , as we have seen many times , took advantage of the shift to the right and , in the last two federal elections , campaigned on a platform that called for a harsher youth justice system . 
reformers decided to fight tooth and nail against what they saw as the excessive clemency of Liberal policies toward young offenders . 
given the situation , it is unlikely that the government will reconsider its plan to reform the Young Offenders Act . 
this is unfortunate , because the government will be missing an opportunity to show how effective the current legislation is and to distance itself from the demagogic policies of the Reform Party . 
bill C - 68 , the Young Offenders Act , as it was called when it was introduced , died on the Order Paper , since we started a new session . 
however , statistics on young offenders tell us it was a pointless piece of legislation anyway . 
many experts in Quebec have condemned the justice minister ' s eagerness to sacrifice several decades of expertise . 
nevertheless she is standing her ground , claiming that a so - called flexibility will allow provinces , especially Quebec , to continue enforcing the model of their choice . 
such flexibility , a kind of opting out , which is as virtual as a stroll on the bow of Titanic , is not tangible and the minister knows it full well . 
the system the minister has been proposing so far is based on the nature and seriousness of the offence , thereby ignoring the young offenders ' needs . 
as a matter of fact , the bill - and this is important - did not even mention the special needs of teenagers . 
however , it is precisely because the Young Offenders Act allows for individual treatment based on each teenager ' s own characteristics that Quebec has the lowest juvenile crime rate in Canada . 
during her summer vacation in Alberta , the Minister of Justice must have had the time to review the request from the Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec government to withdraw Bill C - 68 or , at the very least , to amend it in order to allow the province to continue enforcing the Young Offenders Act its own way , the Quebec way . 
by granting this reasonable request , the minister would make it possible to keep intact an approach that has already proven itself . 
on the other hand , an outright rejection might lead to improper handling of young offenders . 
we hoped that the term " reintroduce " would not mean reintroduction of all the provisions of Bill C - 68 on young offenders , a bill no one in Quebec wanted . 
however , based on the rumours going around the Hill , I fear that the minister will be introducing Bill C - 68 in its entirety within days . 
should this be the case , I trust that members will remind the Minister of Justice that it is not in the interests of either Quebecers or Canadians to back such a reform , since it is not warranted by the present situation . 
the statistics the minister is quoting in support of the Young Offenders Act demonstrate that she does not need to do anything to change that act , only to require that those provinces that do not enforce it do so , in order to achieve the same results as we have had in Quebec . 
those involved in this area in Quebec have worked tirelessly to prevent juvenile delinquency from leading to " chronic delinquency '' ; it would be unfortunate to impose upon them an instrument unsuited to youth rehabilitation . 
in the course of my summer reading , I came across a quote from Honor é de Balzac " Once the convicts were marked , once they were given their numbers , they took on an unalterable character '' . 
it is my belief that , with the young offenders legislation , or the amendments the Minister of Justice wants to make to the Young Offenders Act , these young people will be marked forever , branded , considering all the publicity that surrounds this issue . 
when the time is right , and when the minister reintroduces - as rumours on the Hill would have it - the bill to amend the Young Offenders Act , we shall see what transpires , but the fear is that the minister will go back on the prior commitments . 
too much effort has been invested in Quebec to date for us to be forced in future to regretfully apply the Balzac citation to ourselves . 
for our collective security , the Minister of Justice must abandon her plans once and for all . 
unfortunately , the experience with young offenders legislation reform is not the only one of its kind . 
by way of example , the debate on the reinstatement of life sentences for persons driving while impaired is another illustration of the need for sensationalism of the federal justice system . 
by way of reminder , the government initially agreed with the Bloc Quebecois and amended Bill - 82 to retain the 14 year maximum sentence for persons driving while impaired and causing death . 
during the negotiations preceding the adjournment for the summer recess , the Bloc Quebecois contended that a life sentence was unreasonable , despite the seriousness of such an offence . 
it was a mistake to think that the government would stop there . 
everything indicates , once again , according to the rumours on the Hill , that the government will introduce another bill to obtain a life sentence for impaired driving causing death . 
we will see that , on the subject of justice , the Liberals , the Reformers and , to some extent , the Progressive Conservatives , are all on the far right . 
at page 23 , the throne speech provides : 
the Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats to Canadians and their neighbours around the world . 
it will work to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global in scope , including money laundering , terrorism , and the smuggling of people , drugs and guns . 
it continues : 
the Government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP and other agencies to address threats to public security in Canada - 
i do not know if the government realizes that there is a world of difference between what it says in its speech and what it does in reality . 
maybe reality has caught up with the Liberals but they do not know exactly what to do . 
they should listen more carefully to certain proposals made by the Bloc Quebecois , including the bill introduced by the member for Charlesbourg to withdraw $ 1,000 notes from circulation to help in the fight against money laundering . 
we presented all kinds of information . 
i will close by saying that , at some point , the Bloc Quebecois will reach out to the federal government to conduct a serious study on the whole issue of organized crime . 
i see the Minister of International Trade . 
i think that , as a member from Quebec , it would be interesting if he could co - operate with the Bloc Quebecois to set sound policies - 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon : 
a policy that would show respect for Quebec . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
exactly , and this concludes my remarks . 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I rise today in the House to offer comments on the Speech from the Throne , which was so ably delivered to us by Her Excellency the Governor General last week . 
i also want to thank her for her excellent and moving installation speech . 
i am sure that all of my colleagues in the House join me in offering best wishes to Her Excellency as she begins her term of office . 
her appointment is of special significance to the residents of my riding of Papineau - Saint - Denis . 
i am proud that Her Excellency inspires us all and demonstrates that in this country , Canada , all citizens , old and new , have access to all offices , even to the highest office in the land . 
i know he is particularly well thought of in France . 
in the throne speech , the government stressed the need for Canadians to open up to the world , and to be aware of our role and our responsibilities in this respect and also of the great opportunities and challenges that this entails . 
not the least of these opportunities are those that come about through international trade and capital movement . 
as all members are well aware , Canada has founded its economy on external trade . 
our present and future prosperity and growth are largely dependent on international trade . 
in Canada , one job in three is directly linked to international trade , and 40 % of the GDP depends on it . 
this is the highest percentage of all industrialized countries in the G - 8 . 
a mere five years ago , we exported 25 % of our GDP . 
we have therefore gone from 25 % to 40 % in just under five years . 
the vast majority of the 1,700,000 new jobs created since 1993 are the result of the increase in exports . 
as mentioned in the Speech from the Throne , Canada ' s economy is more open than any of the other leading industrialized countries . 
our investment in diversity over the years is turning into a major asset for us . 
to ensure that we continue to enhance that very real advantage , we intend to increase our trade promotion efforts in those sectors that have high export potential . 
some of these exports did not exist even a few years ago , but thanks to some very dedicated , innovative and very clever people , whole new economic sectors are now growing up where nothing existed before . 
our biotechnology industry for example is pursuing some of the most leading edge innovations in the world . 
our environmental industries are growing at an incredible rate . 
our information technology sector is large and getting larger with investments in high tech all over the world . 
the same is true in many other sectors of our economy such as agriculture , agri - food and natural resources . 
in other words , we are an important player in the global economy . 
as a government , we want to help our industries to develop the linkages with the world that will help bring growth and jobs here to Canada . 
as the throne speech stated , we also intend to create investment in Canada , a co - ordinated effort by all governments and the private sector to promote the unique opportunities that are available here . 
in addition , we will continue to support innovation and the development of new technologies . 
doing so is good for Canada and it is also good for our trading partners . 
of course , one thing that is very favourable for Canada and its trading partners is the introduction of a rules - based international trade system . 
in fact , we are one of the most active advocates and promoters of this system . 
it is important that we be active in this area because our country , Canada , is neither the biggest nor the most powerful country in the world . 
we must continue to co - operate with like - minded countries in order to ensure that the rules are accepted by all and not dictated by the largest players . 
this requires skill and perseverance in all circumstances . 
soon , the WTO ' s ninth round of multilateral trade negotiations will begin in Seattle . 
we hope to be able to build on the successes of the previous rounds . 
during these negotiations , Canada will continue to promote the strengthening of the international trade system . 
we will continue to ask for the rules to become more transparent , predictable and enforceable . 
we will continue to urge the World Trade Organization to keep pace with technological and social change . 
we want a system that would guarantee a level playing field , give Canadian businesses in all sectors easier access to the world markets and respect the needs , values and culture of Canadians as well as the environment . 
issues are brought to the attention of the World Trade Organization on a daily basis . 
the recent interim decision on the Auto Pact is just one example . 
unfortunately , I am clearly not at liberty to comment on this issue today because the decision must remain confidential until it is made public . 
i just want to say that we are actively consulting business people and other governments on this issue , and more specifically on its impact on NAFTA , and we will have another announcement to make . 
some people are also concerned about the United States putting health and education on the table . 
i want to clearly reiterate in this House that our health system is not being threatened and will never be questioned during these negotiations . 
our universal health care system is not negotiable . 
of course , if we can find ways to export our health and education services , we will undoubtedly go ahead and do it . 
but , as the Prime Minister said many times , our universal health care system is central to our way of living . 
we will not let it be weakened in any way . 
i hope to be able to put forward specific proposals to improve it . 
many think the WTO is no longer of any use since we have NAFTA with the United States , which accounts for 85 % of our exports . 
i want to remind the members that the World Trade Organization is still very useful and needed , including to fight protectionist pressure from the United States . 
another long term goal mentioned in the Speech from the Throne is our intention to work with our partners in the hemisphere toward the establishment of the free trade area of the Americas by 2005 . 
i will be very pleased to host the 34 democratic countries of the hemisphere in Toronto in November , to continue to work toward the establishment of that zone of free trade of the Americas . 
in Canada we have the great advantage to be the neighbour of the very strong and dynamic American market . 
as the world trading system opens up as never before , as we enter the age of globalization , an age of new knowledge economies , we have to be aware that this new phenomenon is shaping the choices we make as a society . 
in Canada we believe very much that it is important to humanize globalization . 
it is important to remind ourselves that there is a human purpose to the economy and we want everyone to be able to buy in . 
the humanization of globalization is one of our gouvernment ' s objectives . 
i would like to share with the House some of my thinking , for example , on the issue of culture , on the role of artists in society and thus on the importance of cultural diversity for a country like Canada . 
i find that the role of artists in society is not only to express emotions felt by society but also to shape these emotions . 
at a time when we have to undergo changes as radical as those brought about by the globalization of the economy , I find it extremely important for every country tocontinue to make room for artists and allow artists with this responsibility to shape the emotions felt by people . 
it is extremely important to allow them to work to enlighten us , as a society , on what it is we are going through . 
let us look at the deep emotions , the excitement as well as the insecurity felt by people dealing with globalization . 
in our own society , the society I come from in our country , Quebec society , I look at the role of the artists and the automatistes in the global rejection movement in 1948 . 
i look at Gratien G é linas ' theatre in 1948 as well , his Ti ' Coq . 
these artists were the harbingers in 1948 of the quiet revolution that took place in Quebec in the 1960 s . 
twelve years ahead of time , these artists showed the extent to which Quebec was stifled and had to be liberated from many of its past experiences . 
so , the artists are the ones to see what is coming first . 
i therefore think it extremely important to give this matter careful attention . 
i would also like to tell the House how much the phenomenon of globalization changes the nature of exclusion as well . 
for 200 years , we have fought exploitation . 
the exploitation we have fought for the past 200 years is now over , because , unlike industrial capitalism , financial capitalism means the exclusion of more individuals . 
exclusion is much more radical than exploitation , because exclusion means a total loss of bargaining power . 
in the case of exclusion , there is nothing to negotiate and no one to negotiate with , hence the importance of humanizing globalization , of remembering that the economy has human finality and that it exists to serve the whole population to grow . 
it is extremely important to me that people understand that there is a balance with which the Liberal government has been approaching things , a balance that has to be concerned with this because markets cannot solve every problem . 
of course our commitment should be to make markets work better , but at the same time governments need to pursue policies that reflect the democratic values and inclusiveness that ultimately make economic activity more sustainable . 
as the Speech from the Throne made clear , we intend to do more in the coming months to ensure that Canada continues to be an inclusive society , a society that values the contributions of all its people , a society in which everyone is given a fair chance to participate by helping people to learn new skills and to take new opportunities , a society in which children are given the best start in life and are given the support they need to grow up healthy and safe , and a society that supports and practises the concept of sustainable development for our environment so that future generations will also be able to build their own dreams . 
i think Canada is in a better position than most countries to succeed in the new context of globalization , in large part because of our history and in part because of our geography . 
as the throne speech indicates , Canada was born at a time when countries were formed in the crucible of war or revolution . 
in the 19 th century , the norm in the traditional nation states , as they emerged throughout the world at the time , was for majority to assimilate minority and majority to eliminate differences . 
the traditional nation - state was based on a single language , a single culture , a single religion . 
we chose a Canadian approach to reconciling differences . 
we chose to place tolerance , acceptance and respect of others at the core of our country ' s identity . 
we therefore chose to develop a political citizenship rather than an ethnic , linguistic or religious one . 
that political citizenship allowed diversity to become , not a threat to our identity or our existence - as some try to make it out to be - but instead a strength , an asset . 
canada is a bilingual and multicultural society , one used to the reconciliation of differences and mutual respect . 
moreover , I believe that people everywhere in the world are interested in our experience . 
the most radical and the most fundamental question that will be raised in the new century with the phenomenon of globalization will be : is it possible to live together , equal and different ? 
that is the most radical and the most fundamental question . 
with this throne speech , we want Canada to represent the optimistic response to that fundamental question . 
yes , we can live together , in equality and difference . 
that is the human and optimistic answer . 
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there are a couple of things I would like the minister to address . 
i thank him for being here today to address the Speech from the Throne but there are some things that are missing in the speech . 
where is the plan and where is the high level attack that we need as a country to put against the unfair foreign subsidies that are killing our agriculture community ? 
one thing the minister touched on , which is more to the point , is U.S. protectionism . 
that victory is taking millions of dollars out of the cattle industry in this country every day . 
i would like the minister to comment on what he is going to do . 
the northwest beef producers have been in touch with the government . 
they have suggested changes that could be made to the health regulations for cattle coming from the United States that would help to solve this problem and that would send a message to the ITC that Canada is willing to work at solving this . 
would the minister comment on exactly what his plans are and when this issue will be solved ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the opposition member for giving me the opportunity to add more comments to my speech . 
there are a number of things I did not raise in my 20 - minute speech because obviously one cannot touch on every issue . 
at the end of August , we presented the government ' s position showing our plan and our objective of working very hard at the next round of negotiations to eliminate the European export subsidies . 
the government has stated this position time and again and we will continue to work on it . 
as for cattle , we recognized last week that in part of the decisions we were favoured . 
for instance , on the countervail subsidy side , we won that part of it . 
the member will be pleased , as will the House , that on the countervail subsidies we are very pleased that the U.S. upheld its initial decision and found that Canadian exports of live cattle do not benefit from countervail subsidies , so it is a good decision . 
on the question of whether Canadian cattle were being dumped , that is to say being sold at prices less than the cost of production , the department of commerce reconfirmed an earlier ruling that Canadian cattle were indeed being dumped into the U.S. market . 
as a result , most Canadian producers will now have to pay a 5.6 % duty on their cattle exports to the U.S. 
we expect the decision on November 8 . 
we remain hopeful that they will determine that Canadian exports are not injuring the U.S. domestic industry . 
we will continue to work closely with the Canadian cattle industry . 
Mr. Gordon Earle : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i wonder , with the minister ' s consent and the consent of the House , if we could extend the minister ' s time for questions by about 10 minutes . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments by about 10 minutes ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we would like the minister to give us more time . 
i listened with interest to the address in reply to the throne speech given by the member for Papineau - Saint - Denis . 
on this side of the House we are getting tired of hearing that it feels good to know that Canada is the best country of the world , the government is letting it go to its head . 
to say that Canada is not a traditional nation state as the minister said again today and as he wrote in a book well worth reading , is a contradiction of the throne speech itself . 
as I asked in my own speech last week , how many times is the word national used in the throne speech ? 
the throne speech mentions that Canada has a national government and yet the minister claims it is not a nation state . 
this is a contradiction the minister might want to explain . 
could it be that he disagrees with people who say Canada has a national government ? 
i noticed that regarding negotiations at the WTO , under the heading " international trade '' , the throne speech does not say anything about the provinces taking part in such negotiations . 
i would like to know whether the minister intends to involve the provinces in these negotiations and make sure they are asked to approve any future treaty dealing with issues coming under provincial jurisdiction in the Constitution . 
does he intend to involve parliament in the negotiations ? 
is he willing to have the outcome of such discussions and negotiations reviewed by parliament , not only by the foreign affairs committee , but also by the House of Commons ? 
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew : 
Mr. Speaker , the member for Beauharnois - Salaberry is criticizing the Canadian government for constantly saying that Canada is the best country in the world . 
i would like to tell him that his problem is not with the Canadian government , but with the United Nations . 
indeed , it is the United Nations Development Program that , each year for the past six years , has noted that respect for others and the quality of life in Canada were absolutely remarkable . 
therefore , the member may have more of a problem with the United Nations than with the government . 
he went back to what I said about Canada not being a traditional country , a traditional nation state , and wondered if there was a contradiction between the throne speech and my way of thinking . 
the member for Beauharnois - Salaberry must look at 150 years of history and at the country we have built to see that it is indeed a country , contrary to any nation state . 
what is a traditional nation state ? 
it is a political power that has formed an alliance with a nation , generally the majority nation . 
that is what happened in France , in Great Britain , in Germany and in Italy . 
the state formed an alliance with the majority nation and systematically assimilated minorities and tried to eliminate any differences . 
here , in Canada , the country we have built is not a traditional nation state because , contrary to what happened in other countries , we have built our country on the reconciliation of different peoples and different nations . 
that is Canada ' s strength today . 
since we are a country that did not try to eliminate diversity but , rather , made it central to its identity , I say that in this era of globalization , which imposes diversity everywhere , we have a great advantage in that we have been experiencing such diversity for 150 years , including here in this parliament . 
madam Speaker , you are tolerant toward me , so I will continue to provide replies to the questions that were put to me . 
we are determined to work closely together to ensure that the next round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization will prove as satisfactory to Canadian businesses as did the first eight rounds . 
i can assure you that we will work very hard to achieve that goal . 
as for getting the house involved , we will do all that is necessary with our excellent Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade . 
i will of course be very pleased to work with the committee and with the house . 
Mr. Charlie Penson : 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i think you can see the amount of interest in the House today as we have the Minister for International Trade here . 
there was a motion asking for a 10 - minute extension of questions which was denied . 
i think those people have ducked out . 
i wonder if we might try that again . 
there are different people in the House at the moment and there is an interest . 
i would ask that the minister be allowed to be questioned for another 10 minutes . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
i will ask on your behalf for the unanimous consent of the House to extend the period by 10 minutes . 
is there unanimous consent for this request ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , if members have been paying attention to the news out west they will know that Alberta was troubled over the summer by the antics of an environmental radical bent on destroying the oil industry . 
for clarification , I am referring to Wiebo Ludwig and not the new environment minister , although I understand the hon. member for Victoria has the sport utility owners quaking in their heated leather seats . 
i am anxious to respond to the Speech from the Throne because once again Canadians were forced to endure the platitudes of a political party committed to an unworkable big government agenda . 
as the newly appointed opposition critic for the environment , I would like to address this important aspect of the Liberal agenda . 
i would like to thank my colleague , the hon. member for Lethbridge , for his hard work on this portfolio . 
my colleague has consistently defended the interests of average Canadians against environmental policies that ignore the essential component , people . 
he is a voice for common sense and we can be sure he will bring the same talent and dedication to his new responsibilities in agriculture . 
i would like to address two broad policy concerns which were addressed in the throne speech , first , the concern regarding global warming and second , the concern regarding endangered species legislation . 
with respect to global warming , I have three questions for which I seek clear answers . 
is the planet really warming ? 
what is the cause of this warming ? 
what is the potential consequence for average Canadians of this warming ? 
scientists and environmentalists are not in agreement as to the validity of global warming . 
while climate models produced by computers predict that there should have been some warming over the past 18 years , satellite data collected monitoring global temperature since 1979 actually indicate a slight global cooling . 
therefore these data refute the claim that there is a long term warming trend . 
furthermore , even if we are to assume that the planet is warming , and I must stress that the evidence is inconclusive , we must next consider what the root causes of this warming are . 
have 100 years of industrial activity upset the balance of the ecosystem , or are we witnessing a natural warming trend beyond our control ? 
according to ground level temperature records , most of the increase in the world ' s temperature over the past 100 years occurred before 1940 , before the main input of human induced CO 2 emissions . 
finally we must also consider the actual impact of global warming and the fact that this phenomenon exists . 
environmentalists have long concluded that while there may not be a clear warming trend or a clear cooling trend , we are seeing instability in our global ecosystem that is causing erratic weather patterns . 
if the planet cools , do deserts turn into tropics ? 
if the planet warms , do growing seasons last longer ? 
what is the likely outcome of global warming ? 
i would like to stress again that before we pursue a national energy program style of politics , we must have conclusive evidence that global warming trends are real . 
we must be certain that these trends are the result of industrial CO 2 emissions . 
finally , we must be certain that the effects of this warming trend will be negative for average people . 
when we have conclusive evidence that shows all these three conditions , the Reform Party will be the first to demand action . 
however we will not embark on a reckless and irresponsible campaign that will cripple our economy and send hardworking people to the unemployment lines . 
on the issue of endangered species , in the Globe and Mail this morning I read that the government has failed to achieve adequate habitat preservation in the national parks . 
government stewardship has not achieved the objective it intended to achieve . 
this conclusion comes from an independent task force led by Jacques G é rin . 
this record of failure is interesting when we compare it to the very recent results achieved by a private sector company . 
TransAlta has just completed a massive strip mine reclamation project in Alberta . 
because the company owns the land and because it has an incentive to ensure that the property remains valuable , care was taken to restore the property to its original condition . 
today where the strip mine once provided vital energy to our nation , a wildlife habitat now exists that is recognized the world over as an example of successful private stewardship . 
those at TransAlta did not do this because the Minister of the Environment threatened to put them in prison if they did not . 
this company had the reclamation plans in place one full year before any provincial or federal statutes were passed regulating the impact of resource industries . 
they did it because it made good business sense . 
i would like to quote a former chairman of TransAlta who worked on this project . 
Marshall Williams said " it made business sense that land on a major tourism route into Jasper be reclaimed and perhaps sold at a future date for a reasonable return '' . 
a wildlife habitat was created because it made good business sense . 
this is a powerful demonstration of the success of private property rights in ensuring the preservation of the environment in harmony with sustainable development . 
when property rights are respected , there is little conflict between sustainable development and both habitat and resource management . 
where conflicts do exist , a policy of co - operation and partnership will ensure that wild areas are preserved for all Canadians with the costs borne equally by all Canadians . 
the government ' s idea of an environmental partnership is a prison cell and a pair of handcuffs . 
in past attempts at creating endangered species legislation , the Liberals were prepared to levy fines up to $ 250,000 or five years in jail as punishment against otherwise honest , law - abiding people . 
the government ' s idea of environmental education is fearmongering and misinformation . 
instead of challenging the critics of global warming or ozone depletion , the Liberal government has disgracefully politicized environmental science . 
when the leader of the Reform Party challenged the junk science of the Kyoto agreement , the government responded with personal attacks . 
the government ' s idea of a common sense environmental policy is more taxes : tax cars and tax gas and force low income Canadians to give up the pleasure and freedom of mobility ; after that , tax industries and emissions and send hardworking people to the unemployment lines . 
that is the Liberal plan for the environment . 
Canadians deserve better than that from their government and they deserve better from the Minister of the Environment . 
if problems such as climate change and dangerous levels of persistent toxins can be resolved , it will very likely necessitate a ban on all speeches given by the government benches . 
their hot air is what is really causing global warming . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
i remember 35 or 38 years ago we were ranching up in Dead man country out of Savannah , British Columbia . 
one of the big news articles of the day was to prepare for a new ice age . 
that was the government ' s selling point , prepare for the new ice age . 
it was cold enough we could almost believe it . 
it became a big topic with all the other ranchers and that maybe everybody should get ready . 
the government had us frightened about what was going to happen . 
i was fairly young then . 
we wondered whether we had enough winter feed in for the cattle and everything else . 
lo and behold , the next winter it was a fair bit milder and it was really nice . 
after falling into that trap back then and getting worried and upset about different things , I came to the conclusion that this is a big money scheme . 
these issues become big dollars , big business for many different groups . 
today it is the ozone and global warming ; next year it is just as likely to be prepare for the new ice age . 
i would like the hon. member ' s comments . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
madam Speaker , I thank the member for Okanagan - Shuswap for his very pertinent intervention . 
from my hon. colleague ' s intervention , there is no doubt that whatever certain groups tend to say or wherever the politically correct argument of the day lies is where the present government and obviously past governments tend to go . 
there is no doubt that when working hard in minus 55 degree weather , as many farmers do , they are asking where this global warming is , if it actually exists . 
they are hoping for it . 
i wanted to make clear in my speech that the government has to step back and take a critical look at what sort of policies it is implementing today . 
they are going to affect future generations . 
it must look at what sort of effects they are going to have on industry as well . 
people who are working hard to make ends meet are being put on the welfare lines simply because of poor management decisions by the government . 
i was trying to encourage this government to think about it . 
as a younger Canadian in the House looking forward , in trying to create sustainable development in this country , let us take a step back . 
let us make sure that when we make decisions that are going to be implemented today that they are going to be compatible with the future of the developing economies and of the environment . 
let us not make rash decisions that are going to end up backfiring on future generations . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I appreciate the comments of the Reform Party member . 
however , I do not think that the expression global warming really tells the public what is at stake here . 
it would be more appropriate to talk about climate destabilization . 
this is what causes the flooding , ice storms and tornadoes that destroy crops and towns , and that kill people . 
the government has not met the challenge - in fact there is not even any mention of that challenge in the throne speech - of dealing with the climate destabilization we are currently witnessing . 
how can we ensure that people will be able to face the various problems that this destabilization will generate ? 
i would like to hear the comments of the Reform Party member on this aspect of the issue . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
madam Speaker , the Bloc Quebecois member has expressed another point of view in the debate on the environment . 
i think that the government should really sit up and take note . 
for example , it should be telling us about the effects on the environment of climate destabilization . 
i think the government should perhaps examine this point of view more closely , instead of telling us about vague things like global warming . 
i thank my colleague for his question . 
perhaps we can consider this further at a future date . 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
her reaction to the things we do here has been enlightening to me . 
her almost childlike enthusiasm , seeing the things that she has seen , reminds me that this is a very special place and a very special opportunity . 
it reminds me as well of what a privilege it is to serve my constituents and express their ideas and constructive thoughts . 
i have had a recent responsibility change in parliament . 
i would like to take this opportunity as well to express my thanks to those individuals who made my job as health critic so enjoyable . 
i had an opportunity to associate with and have interchange with associations across the country , medical , nursing , dental and chiropractic associations and many individuals who had strong positions . 
for instance , the public who fought for freedom in health foods and in alternative therapies were very powerful individuals . 
they made their positions so strongly known that the government changed some of its direction in those areas . 
i met some victims who contracted hepatitis C from tainted blood . 
their powerful position , especially that of a young man , made the government look shaky in some instances . 
i would like to focus on little Joey Hach é , a young man with an illness that should have made him weak , should have sapped his strength , but instead has made him strong . 
i want all Canadians to know how proud I am to have known him and to have had a little opportunity to interchange with him . 
i want to be very careful that the wording I use is exact because Reformers believe that Canada can be united by reforming the federation on the principle of equality and through a rebalancing of power . 
knowing what that means and what , from my party ' s perspective , we mean in terms of unity , I looked carefully at the throne speech to see what it said on the issue of unity . 
this was the government ' s response : 
the best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians . 
[ - ] the Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians that the principle of clarity , as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada , will be respected . 
this is the Government of Canada ' s response on this very important matter : the clarity of the question , the majority acceptable , and the negotiation process . 
these are not the best way to ensure Canada ' s unity . 
as the Reform Party sees it , the way to ensure our country ' s unity is to make changes in the federation . 
for instance , we would like to strengthen or improve the exercise of federal legislative and administrative authority in the following areas : defence , foreign affairs , monetary policy , regulation of financial institutions , criminal law , definition of national standards , equalization payments , international trade and interprovincial trade . 
these are important matters that come under federal jurisdiction . 
must try to strengthen or improve the exercise of provincial legislative and administrative authority in the following areas : natural resources , manpower training , social services , education , language and culture , municipal affairs , sports , housing , and tourism . 
these are to diminish federal intrusion into exclusive areas of provincial responsibility . 
what does that mean to my home constituency in Alberta ? 
that means that many of the things that Albertans are disappointed with and unhappy with in the way our federation works would be answered . 
what would that mean for those disaffected in Quebec ? 
in my view , and in the view of my party , it would mean exactly the same thing , a rebalancing of the powers of confederation based on the principle of equality . 
that is quite different than just simply saying there is one way , the status quo . 
that has been the complaint I have heard over and over again from my Quebec colleagues , many of whom feel there is no other option but to split from this country . 
my colleagues across the way seem to think that the option is to stay rigid . 
we believe that there is a troisi è me voie , a third way , another mechanism to reach the same goal : a stronger federation , not for those in these halls but for our children . 
some other things that we think would go a long way toward improving our country would be changes in the way things work in this House . 
we believe that we could involve members of parliament better to make backbench MPs feel that they have a powerful place here by freeing up votes on issues that should not be a vote of confidence . 
if a vote causes a bill of the government to fail , there could simply be a vote of confidence in the government so that the government itself would not fail . 
that is done in other jurisdictions . 
it is mind numbing to my constituents at home why we have the convention that the failure of a bill would cause the government to fail . 
there are very few bills that should cause the government to fail . 
we also believe that we could involve the public better in terms of being able to initiate by citizens ' initiative information or laws that are not coming from the government and binding national referenda on major important issues , especially moral issues . 
three hundred and one individuals in the country should not decide an issue of such importance . 
these things , in terms of direct democracy , we are convinced would make a huge difference to the way this place works and also to the way politicians are looked at and thought of . 
time is always short . 
the government had very little to say about unity , maybe hoping that the unity problem would gradually diminish . 
i have looked at the unity debate over the last 30 years and have found that the interest in sovereignty goes up and down , and it is usually from combative things that are done in this place that sovereignty gets its strength . 
i look forward to working with my colleagues in the House on this issue and I look forward as well to an interchange with Canadians who will guide me and help me to be at least a proper debater in this area . 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , first I would like to congratulate my Reform colleague for his appointment as his party ' s intergovernmental affairs critic . 
i am sure he will be as keen and dedicated in his new role as he was as health critic . 
i am looking forward to debates with him and the intergovernmental affairs minister , as undoubtedly they will be worthwhile debates . 
i would like to point out to him that indeed very little was said in the throne speech about unity . 
obviously this is the way we feel the federal government thinks federalism should be . 
actually , not so much the federal government because the words federal and federalism hardly occur in the throne speech . 
i would like to know whether the Reform intergovernmental affairs critic has noticed , as we have , that the government wants to centralize , and whether his party is not discouraged by this government ' s attitude when it comes to changing the way we look at the future and federalism in Canada . 
Mr. Grant Hill : 
i thank the hon. member for his question . 
for us Reformers , the problem is partly the centralization of the federal government ' s business . 
it is not the only problem . 
there are other issues and a balance is necessary in this debate . 
we would like the question to be clear , we would like to know what constitutes a clear majority and we would like to know about negotiations , should a referendum end with a victory for the yes side . 
this is a major concern . 
it is not a concern that affects just one province or one group of Canadians , but one that concerns everyone . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I also congratulate my colleague on his new portfolio . 
i think he will do an excellent job . 
when it comes to rebalancing powers , many people often confuse the position of the official opposition . 
could he add some clarity , that we are not just talking about independent states far away from the government but a better working relationship ? 
often when we talk about rebalancing people look to see if we are trying to advocate independent provinces that have no regard for the federal government . 
we are looking at the opposite . 
we want the federal government to show more respect for the provinces and to let them take on more decision making and work in a much better fashion than is happening now . 
would my hon. colleague comment on that particular relationship ? 
Mr. Grant Hill : 
madam Speaker , that is a very helpful question . 
there are things that the original constitution laid out as exclusive responsibilities of both the federal government and the provincial governments . 
there is no question that there has been an intrusion into those areas of provincial responsibility . 
my colleagues from the Bloc will point that out every time it happens . 
we look for a strengthening of the federal role in certain areas and a strengthening and improvement of the provincial role in other areas . 
most importantly , we look for a co - operative approach , if there is to be money spent on specific things that the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over , and not simply an edict from on high . 
that helps in other parts of the country and , in my view , it certainly helps in Quebec . 
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I too wish to offer my congratulations to the governor general . 
i had a pretty interesting summer . 
for a Liberal MP it was actually a pretty easy summer because people in my constituency appreciate the efforts of the government , the way it has managed the finances of the nation and the way in which there is a great deal of employment , particularly in my area of the country . 
there were times when I referred to it as a love - in . 
when we ended the congratulatory exchanges between member and constituent , one of the issues that kept coming up was the behaviour and performance of parliamentarians . 
Canadians do not really understand what it is we do here . 
i spent a lot of time trying to explain what it is that we do . 
what they see is question period . 
that is what they believe parliament is all about . 
i had some difficulties in explaining to them that parliament is something more than us making silly fools out of ourselves in question period . 
not only does parliament end up in disrepute , it means that parliament is not seen as a forum for debating the larger issues of the day . 
it is an anachronistic irrelevancy and more , and Canadians just switch channels rather than engage in political debate . 
one of the reasons we do not involve ourselves in the big issues of the day is that we end up in partisan slinging matches which do us no credit at the end of the day . 
i am as guilty as any other person in the House . 
i anticipate that notwithstanding this speech and to the contrary I will not greatly improve my behaviour . 
however , in an effort to be non - partisan I want to compliment the Leader of the Opposition on his remarks and to pick up on some of the comments he made in his speech even though I do not have 100 minutes . 
the thrust of his remarks was that the serious issues of the day were being dealt with by the courts rather than by parliament because parliament seemed to be quite prepared to duck the issues and to let the courts decide . 
he also stated that transferring the charter of rights from a system of checks and balances , as is found in the United States where there is a clear legislative function , a clear administrative function and a clear judicial function , has not translated well in a parliamentary democracy such as ours where the legislative function and the administrative function are clearly fused , which in some respects leaves the judicial function out on its own . 
he went on to cite a number of decisions that leave a great deal to be desired in their interpretation and application . 
he made reference to the Singh decision which has imposed upon our nation a refugee determination system that is both costly and cumbersome . 
the government is stuck with a costly and problematic refugee system which shows its flaws when migrants show up on our shores with absolutely no intention of making any claim for status . 
he made reference as well to the Marshall treaty about which we have heard a great deal . 
these decisions in isolation are quite sound . 
legal reasoning within the confines of a courtroom have a certain purity and logic but leave a great deal to be desired in application . 
i am not here to blame judicial activism . 
i believe the courts would only be too happy to return to what we used to call in law school black letter law . 
for instance , on the issue of spousal definition , Mr. Justice Cory said : 
the issue of how the term spouse should be defined is a fundamental social policy issue and Parliament should decide it and Parliament should listen to and balance the competing social issues , the philosophical issues , the legal , moral , theological issues that go into this definitional process . 
the courts shouldn ' t be deciding it . 
parliament should be deciding it and the courts should defer to Parliament . 
the reality is that the foregoing issues have not been addressed by parliament in any meaningful way notwithstanding that they are well within the competence of parliament . 
there is no party or government that runs on a pro - pornography platform . 
as a practising politician , there are a lot of these issues I would be just as happy to duck . 
these issues are largely the result of parliamentary neglect rather than judicial activism . 
picking up on the comments about family by the Leader of the Opposition I would suggest that the legal environment as set out in M and H is as follows . 
first , discrimination between unmarried heterosexual couples living in a conjugal relationship is contrary to the guarantee section in section 15 of the charter . 
second , discrimination between married and unmarried common law spouses is contrary to section 15 of the charter . 
third , discrimination between married and unmarried couples is not contrary to section 15 if is intended to promote family , children and marriage and has a socioeconomic basis that parliament can articulate . 
we have heard several suggestions . 
one of the easiest suggestions is to do nothing . 
others suggest we should use section 33 to do an override . 
might I suggest a more nuanced approach to this major social issue . 
for want of a better term may I suggest that it be called the three silos concept . 
the first silo is that of marriage . 
marriage is a unique institution of great significance to many Canadians particularly of religious and cultural communities . 
i recommend that the government make a strong and positive statement rather than simply use double negatives so that any legislative ambiguities may be cleared up . 
the second silo is that of registered domestic partnerships . 
surely that should be an operative principle in anything we discuss . 
the second point in the domestic registered partnership is that legislative entitlement and responsibility are based on dependency rather than conjugality . 
i do not quite see why that is so problematic for people . 
i do not really know why the state should again be pursuing what happens in the bedrooms of the nation . 
it should be a test of dependency rather than of conjugality . 
the third point of the operating principle of domestic partnerships is that they be treated the same as marriage unless parliament can demonstrate some compelling socioeconomic reason otherwise . 
fourth , it should recognize that the family has many forms in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries . 
fifth , the government should open a register for domestic partnerships for same sex conjugal , same sex non - conjugal , opposite sex conjugal and opposite sex non - conjugal , with the only proviso that there be one relationship at a time and that any rights or benefits not be greater than anything that would be acquired by marriage . 
sixth , we should expunge the concept of spouse from the lexicon , save and except for those people who are married , and replace that language with that of partner . 
seventh , we would eliminate other forms of discrimination between conjugal and non - conjugal couples . 
eighth is the principle that registered domestic partnership is severed on death . 
it may be dissolved in the same manner as any partnership . 
the third silo is that of what is called a non - registered domestic partnership , which would essentially be the same as a second silo although in this particular instance the individual couples claiming this benefit would have to prove on the balance of probabilities that in fact they did live in a relationship with some dependency . 
if in fact parliament were to adopt this kind of reasoning , the government would be able to draft an omnibus bill . 
it is my belief that there would be virtually no one in the House who could vote against the positioning because of the wide range of views that are accommodated . 
i would argue that parliament properly should reflect that wide range of views . 
to return to the theme as I have outlined it , I would prefer to see parliament dealing with the big issues of the day rather than exercises in partisan foolishness . 
i would prefer when I visit a public school or a high school that I could point to colleagues who have made thoughtful contributions to the big issues on both sides of the House . 
i appreciate the opportunity to present those views and I look forward to questions . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened carefully to the remarks of my hon. colleague opposite . 
he made a very thoughtful and thought provoking speech . 
i know that as an active and able member of the justice committee he holds very sincerely to the ideals he has put forward . 
i listened with particular interest when he spoke of parliamentary neglect as opposed to judicial activism . 
i guess it goes without saying that as a member on the government side he is in a very unique position in his ability now to move the government to being more active in some of the social areas that he touched upon . 
in particular , I would like to get the member ' s comments arising out of the throne speech where some of the policing issues I feel were not given a great deal of attention or a great deal of emphasis . 
the hon. member would know that the RCMP in particular is facing a near crisis with respect to the increase in drug trafficking , illegal immigration , organized crime and crime stemming from the increase in Mafia , and I am talking about Mafia from outside Canada obviously . 
i would suggest that the same situation exists in our armed forces . 
specifically with respect to the police I am wondering what it is he suggests we should be doing and what the government intends to do about this increasing problem in Canada . 
Mr. John McKay : 
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough for his comments . 
i thought my speech was about three silos , registered domestic partnerships and so on . 
however I was asked a question about policing which I do not think I mentioned . 
having said that , in some respects the response of the government to many of these issues should be to refer a number of them to the justice committee in particular or to other committees as the case may be . 
on the face of it that has a superficial attractiveness to it . 
in my area of Toronto and the GTA we have a particular problem with homelessness which is frankly nation - wide . 
how that ranks in priority to any resources that the police may need I do not know . 
i know when the police come before the justice committee they do make excellent presentations and what they say is frequently heard . 
for instance , on the issue of child pornography in the Shaw decision I really do not know why that should stick to the government or to any particular party because no one is in favour of that kind of activity . 
that is the kind of thing that should be coming before the justice committee , with the competing values to be analysed , the competing requests for priority , whether they are police priorities or other kinds of criminal justice priorities , and then a reasoned decision is reached . 
Mr. John Richardson ( Perth - Middlesex , Lib . ) : 
we stand before a new century confident in the promise of Canada for our children and grandchildren . 
yet without proper management it is difficult to sustain . 
i applaud the government ' s untiring work not only to support our nation but to encourage Canadians to grow beyond the envelope . 
our children and our children ' s children will ultimately benefit from the new direction our government is now taking . 
i understand full well the benefits and consequences of our social system . 
in a recent era of cutbacks and slowdowns many Canadians have seen the fabric of our social safety net fray , but that era is finally behind us . 
with better services being provided for early childhood education , health , the environment , families and our infrastructure , Canadians can face the challenges of the 21 st century with confidence . 
the task at hand is in no way simple . 
it will require perseverance and grit for every Canadian to see benefit from this new direction . 
the throne speech states that " the strength of Canada is reflected in its rich diversity '' . 
this simple phrase speaks volumes about Canada ' s ethnic makeup and the bounty all Canadians reap from it . 
it is amazing to think in a world torn asunder by wars of ethnic and religious hatred that Canada stands apart like a beacon of tolerance . 
this pluralistic cohabitation has led to an immense wealth of culture , plucked from the very communities that make up Canada ' s geography . 
a people are made up of their past and their future . 
the synergy of these two creates Canada ' s national identity . 
it is this identity that culture seeks to preserve , to bottle it in words or movement , to embellish it in works of art or in monuments that grace our parks . 
with new technologies come new possibilities for enhancing our cultural heritage . 
the 21 st century will allow us to bring the world into the classrooms and homes of every Canadian . 
no longer are Canadians hindered by the vast distances that separate them . 
the digital age is upon us . 
by plugging in , people will be able to explore the world around them without leaving the comfort of their chair . 
our government must embrace this medium by linking our cultural resources and ensuring access to all Canadians . 
the benefits gained by such quality exposure are immeasurable . 
if we speak of cultural heritage then it must also hold true for the military . 
Canadians owe it to our veterans to ensure that the memory of their deeds remain in our collective psyche . 
every regiment ' s imprint runs deep in their respective communities . 
each has its own story to tell and they often do it with fervour . 
as veterans pass and memories fade , there is a generation of children and grandchildren now making themselves aware of Canada ' s proud war history and affirming their important role in educating generations to come . 
as such , we are standing on the forward edge of a new era where digital technology will move beyond anything we can imagine and will provide government with the tools to marry the past and future into a seamless venue to attract and amaze viewers . 
imagine ourselves participating in a World War I dogfight in the skies over northern Europe or experiencing the emotions as we crash ashore in Normandy on June 6 , 1944 . 
using leading edge technology to improve our cultural attractions , this type of viewer interaction is a real possibility . 
renewed emphasis on our National War Museum will not only enhance the prestige of our historical past but will also the government to focus new technologies into bringing the past alive . 
today ' s youth seem to lack the knowledge of the great deeds our forefathers performed in acts of utter selflessness and courage . 
i wonder how many people today really and truly understand the meaning of Passchendaele , Vimy Ridge , the Scheldt or Hill 355 . 
the government has a duty to pay homage to that past , to elevate and preserve their memory for time immemorial . 
the Canadian War Museum will not only honour those who served in war and peacekeeping but will also ensure that their legacy of heroism and sacrifice is not forgotten by generations that have never experienced war . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I listened quite intently to the hon. member ' s very eloquent speech . 
i commend him on pointing out the importance of the rich diversity of our country . 
i was somewhat disappointed with the throne speech . 
to this day I have not yet received a response to satisfactorily explain what took place in that situation . 
what we really say to people in our society comes through by our actions more so than the words that are written in a speech . 
if this speech is to be meaningful as we move forward into the 21 st century , if we are to give more substance to these words , then the actions have to prove and bear out that we really mean what we are talking about in terms of the diversity of our country making us strong and people having equal opportunities . 
when the hon. member mentioned the military , I thought about our veteran merchant mariners who are still fighting for justice , still seeking some form of compensation to make up for the injustice that was done to them following the war . 
could he also perhaps indicate how he sees his government moving forward in a real positive way to give some substance to the words that are in the throne speech ? 
Mr. John Richardson : 
Mr. Speaker , I would really like to respond to the first part of the member ' s question but I do not have the background on the issue at hand . 
as I do not know the situation thoroughly , I feel I would be overstepping the knowledge I have in order to give an answer . 
we both see eye to eye and we will continue to work on behalf of our veterans who crewed the ships during the war and were lost in heavy numbers or were taken prisoner well in advance of many members of the Canadian forces . 
it is certainly my wish to see a wrong righted in that area as well . 
i do not think I can say much more other than to say that we do see eye to eye . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in standing to speak to the throne speech , I must say that there were no big surprises . 
since I hold the critic responsibility for the Reform Party in the area of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , I eagerly scanned the throne speech to see what was in there that related to aboriginal people and the challenges that aboriginal people and government face in Canada today . 
i was not surprised but I was disappointed to see that there was no change in direction on the part of the government and that it is steady as she goes . 
the government feels that it is charting the right course . 
it obviously continues to use words like partnership , gathering strength and all kinds of nice words and phrases that would leave the average person listening to the throne speech with the impression that progress has been made , is actually being made and that things are continuing to improve . 
i can assure the House that nothing could be further from the truth . 
in fact , for aboriginal people in Canada things continue to go downhill . 
the social problems on reserves continue to worsen . 
the economic circumstances for aboriginal people living on reserves continue to worsen . 
the programs that have been put in place by successive governments over a long period of time in the country have actually , if anything , been counterproductive to the health and welfare of aboriginal people in Canada . 
as an example , the Government of Canada decided to invest in aboriginal economic development back in the early 1990 s . 
it spent $ 1 billion on aboriginal economic development over a period of four years . 
the question one naturally asks is why would the government continue to go down the same road when there have been no positive results and there continue to be negative results ? 
do we not learn as human beings from experience ? 
do we not look to the past to gather and analyse information to assist us in making decisions about what we are going to do in the future ? 
that is really what learning and human history is all about . 
the government has refused to do that . 
naturally , one asks why we would go through the trouble of having all of these government departments that can track the impacts and effects of various government programs and expenditures if we are not going to pay attention to the results . 
i have come to the conclusion that the government by choice automatically insulates itself from the realities of its own policies . 
it does not want that feedback . 
it does not want to know that its policies are failures . 
the Liberals do not have the courage to face that challenge . 
they do not have the courage to admit that the way things have been done in the past , the policies that have been implemented and the taxpayers ' money that has been expended has not been of any benefit to native people in Canada . 
is the government not willing at least to analyse the results of its policies ? 
we would think that at least a majority of native leaders would be interested in going through that analysis and going back to government and saying that what the government has been doing has not been working and they need a change . 
i think the reason becomes clear when more time is spent looking at what the department of Indian affairs does and how it has a relationship with native leaders across Canada and native leaders at the national level . 
there is a symbiotic relationship . 
both parties are unwilling to admit failure because they fundamentally do not want to change the status quo . 
one of the things that strikes me as I travel from place to place and talk with grassroots aboriginal people is that they feel as fundamentally disconnected from their leaders in many cases as do ordinary Canadians from their political leaders . 
there is a sense of frustration that the programs are supposed to be benefiting them as individuals but they are not hitting the mark . 
one has to do a critical analysis to determine why that is the case . 
the greatest mistake the federal government has made and continues to make and shows no sign of changing when it comes to native people is it continues to treat native people as collectivities rather than as individuals . 
it wants to deal in programs and policies that are related directly to collectivities . 
that is why we see certain things in modern treaties that are being negotiated . 
fundamentally it sees the Nisga ' a as a collectivity of some 5,000 people . 
it does not see the individuals . 
it looks at the Nisga ' a people , and aboriginal people in general , as being some kind of homogeneous group that thinks the same way , that wants the same things and that fundamentally has a culture that is different from the rest of Canada and therefore must be treated differently . 
of course , what gets lost in the shuffle when that happens is the individual . 
individual rights are put on the back burner in favour of collective rights , and individual aboriginal people are coming to that realization in a major way in the country .

Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 249 , an act to prohibit the export of water by interbasin transfers . 
there is a great interest in the country in terms of bulk water exports and the bill is very specific . 
there are various requests on various order papers , in a sense , of firms wishing to divert rivers into other basins in order to export water to the United States and northern Mexico . 
this bill would prohibit such interbasin transfers of water for export purposes . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure what the numbers mean , but I can describe the bills . 
one deals with release on bail and the other is in regard to special consideration for aboriginal offenders . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
perhaps we could proceed with other routine proceedings and the hon. member could clarify which two of the four he would like to introduce and we could come back to this a little later . 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
* * * 
committees OF THE HOUSE

Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in relation to one of our standing committees I think you would find consent for me to move the following motion : 
that , notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order 106 ( 1 ) the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans be permitted to meet for the purposes of electing a chair on Wednesday , October 20 , 1999 .

( motion agreed to ) 
the Deputy Speaker : 
we will now revert to the introduction of private members ' bills . 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , this private member ' s bill is an act to amend the Criminal Code to prevent a person accused of sexual assault with a weapon , aggravated assault , sexual assault or criminal harassment who has been identified by the victim or by a witness to the offence from being released until the charge is withdrawn or the accused is acquitted at a trial . 
section 522 , which currently allows a judge of a court of a superior or criminal jurisdiction the discretion to allow bail in these very serious offences , would be repealed . 
this would be one major way of providing a great deal of safety to a number of Canadians who are injured annually by people who commit violent crimes while released on bail . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
the drunk driver in this case was Christopher Goodstoney and he was charged with four counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing injury . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , that is out of order . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member is permitted to give a succinct explanation of the purpose of the bill and we have not heard anything yet about the bill . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I am really sorry . 
i hate to offend my little friend across the way . 
i will see if I can do a better job . 
the bill is to prevent a judge having to take into consideration the race of a criminal when he is convicted of a crime . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
petitions 
taxation 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very honoured to stand in my place today to represent my constituents by presenting two petitions . 
the first one has to do with discrimination under the Income Tax Act against families that choose to have one parent stay at home . 
they ask that the tax benefits be the same for single income families as they are for double income families . 
there are 229 names on this petition and we have had a number before . 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition I am honoured to present today adds to the 300,000 names already presented in the House on the issue of child pornography . 
i am very pleased with the people in my riding who to this date have submitted 4,311 names on this petition requesting that the government should immediately take steps to re - enact the provisions of the criminal code which make the possession of child pornography illegal in Canada . 
the SNOWBIRDS 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour and obligation to present a petition regarding the Snowbirds signed by several hundred folks mostly in my constituency , but I note names from Alberta and British Columbia . 
the petition notes that the Snowbirds are a national symbol and a Canadian institution . 
it reverts to subject matter of this summer wherein the Department of National Defence was suggesting that the Snowbirds 431 air demonstration squadron could be and should be scrapped for financial reasons . 
the petition also notes that the mission of the Snowbirds is to demonstrate the skill , professionalism and teamwork of the Canadian forces and that these magnificent pilots and their flying machines should remain airborne for the foreseeable future . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to take the action necessary to ensure that continued and stable funding for the Snowbirds 431 air demonstration squadron remains a priority . 
the CONSTITUTION 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , speaking of some of the events that happened this summer , I am also pleased to present a petition in conformity with Standing Order 36 . 
they are concerned about the preamble to the charter of rights and freedoms as a foundation upon which the subsequent sections are based . 
they are concerned about the majority of Canadians . 
they believe in God who created heaven and earth and are not offended by the mention of His name in the preamble of the charter of rights and freedom . 
they are proud to name Him and they present this petition to parliament . 
nuclear WEAPONS 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present two petitions . 
the first one is on the subject of nuclear weapons . 
it notes that there continue to exist over 30,000 nuclear weapons on the earth and that the continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to the health and survival of human civilization and the global environment . 
it also notes the concerns of the Secretary - General of the United Nations on this subject . 
the petitioners therefore pray and request that parliament support the immediate initiation and conclusion by the year 2000 of an international convention which will set out a binding timetable for the abolition of all nuclear weapons . 
the SENATE 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present a second petition on the subject of the abolition of the Senate . 
the petitioners from my constituency of Burnaby - Douglas and elsewhere note that the Senate of Canada is an undemocratic institution composed of unelected members who are unaccountable to the people , that it costs taxpayers some $ 50 million per year , that its role is redundant given the roles played by the supreme court and the provinces , that it undermines the role of MPs in the House of Commons , and that there is a need to modernize our parliamentary institutions . 
therefore the petitioners call upon parliament to undertake measures aimed at the abolition of the Senate . 
NISGA ' A TREATY 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to table a petition signed by 237 persons in my riding of Okanagan - Shuswap . 
they are asking for the rejection of the Nisga ' a treaty that will serve to entrench inequality and may divide Canadians forever . 
the SNOWBIRDS 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to present this petition pursuant to Standing Order 36 on behalf of a number of western Canadians who are concerned about the Snowbirds as a national symbol and a Canadian institution . 
they make a number of points , one being that 85 million North American spectators have been enthralled by the Snowbirds over the past 28 years . 
they ask parliament to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that continued and stable funding for the Snowbirds 431 air demonstration squadron remains a priority for our country . 
genetically MODIFIED FOOD PRODUCTS 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the first petition that I am tabling in the House today is asking for the mandatory labeling and thorough checking of genetically modified food products . 
this issue concerns many Canadians . 
the petitioners are calling upon parliament to adopt an act on the labeling of genetically modified food items . 
food LABELLING 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is calling upon parliament to pass legislation to make it compulsory for companies importing food products into Canada to ensure that these products are properly labelled as to the ingredients they contain . 
they are asking that all companies importing food products into Canada ensure that those products are properly and thoroughly labelled as to the ingredients they contain and the ingredients they contain by virtue of the environment in which they have been prepared .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government ORDERS 
canada ELECTIONS ACT 
bill C - 2 . 
on the Order : 
government Orders 
October 14 1999 - The Leader of the Government in the House - Second Reading and Referral to Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs of Bill C - 2 , an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons , repealing other acts and making consequential amendments to other acts . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I move : 
that Bill C - 2 , an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons , repealing other acts and making consequential amendments to other acts , be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . 
the Canada Elections Act constitutes the operational basis of our democratic electoral system . 
our elections act is based on three essential principles : equity , transparency and accessibility . 
for close to 30 years now , the Canada Elections Act has been the focal point of an electoral system that has been an inspiration to democracies the world over . 
our Elections Act is based on solid principles and orientations . 
nevertheless , administrative inconsistencies have developed over those 30 years , and we need to eliminate them and to amend sections of the Act the courts have chosen to strike down . 
first of all , I would like to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for preparing the excellent report on which this legislation is based , particularly the hon. member for Peterborough who chaired its work . 
the amendments we propose today are based on the committee ' s findings and recommendations . 
the bill also reflects the recommendations contained in the 1991 report of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform , the Lortie Commission , the proposals submitted in 1993 by the special House committee , and the Chief Electoral Officer ' s reports to parliament in 1996 and 1997 . 
as well , the bill reflects discussions between myself and my counterparts in the United Kingdom , as well as the ideas , concerns and initiatives shared with us by large numbers of MPs , senators , members of all political parties , academics , interest groups and ordinary citizens . 
our government is determined to see this bill passed and to implement amendments which reflect the wisdom and collective vision of the hon. members . 
reference to a committee before second reading will permit broader amendments , provided of course that these amendments amend the same statute as is the subject of the bill . 
allow me to take some time to describe some of the administrative changes proposed in this bill . 
we have proposed that the chief electoral officer be empowered to adjust voting hours for areas that do not switch to daylight saving time . 
this will address the problem Saskatchewan voters experienced in the last election . 
we are also offsetting the impact of inflation since the act was introduced in 1974 , increasing the threshold for the disclosure of the names and addresses of campaign contributors for donations and the threshold for receiving the 75 % political tax credit from $ 100 to $ 200 . 
we have proposed extending voting rights to all returning officers in Canada . 
we have included amendments to ensure the right to campaign canvassing and the posting of signs in apartment buildings . 
we have proposed that the enforcement capabilities of the commissioner of Canada elections be strengthened . 
in recent years , court decisions have called on the Government of Canada to take a second look at some sections of the Canada Elections Act . 
we believe that amendments in this legislation are consistent with both the spirit and the letter of those decisions . 
our amendments regarding third party spending are a perfect case in point . 
we looked closely at the 1996 decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal which threw out the previous spending limits , but we also examined the 1997 Libman decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which said : 
the court further stated : " While we recognize their right '' - third parties - `` to participate in the electoral process , independent individuals and groups cannot be subject to the same financial rules as candidates or political parties and be allowed the same spending limits . 
although what they have to say is important , it is the candidates and political parties that are running for election . 
limits on independent spending must therefore be lower than those imposed on candidates or political parties '' . 
we have also placed fairness at the heart of the proposed changes to the rules governing blackouts . 
recently the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the 72 hour election blackout on election polls . 
however , the court did not close the door on giving voters the means and the time to assess polls . 
consistent with the guidance of the court , we have required publication of polling methodologies and we have shortened the blackout period . 
we have also addressed the issue of blackouts on political advertising . 
we have proposed a new 48 hour blackout period prior to election day on political ads ; no ads on election day and the day before for anybody . 
we want to make sure that the only group to get the last word in a campaign is Canadian voters . 
most recently the Figueroa decision of the Ontario court struck down another provision in the elections act under which a political party that loses its status as a registered party must deregister and liquidate all its assets and turn them over to the receiver general . 
we took note of that decision and we responded by allowing third parties that fail to field the required number of candidates during an election to retain their assets subject to certain conditions . 
the government is however , and most members will know this , appealing that part of the court order holding that a party need only nominate two candidates to become a registered party . 
the government believes strongly that the existing requirements should be defended . 
does it promote accessibility ? 
does it keep our electoral system open and transparent ? 
i believe that in every case the answer is yes . 
of course this is going to be a non - partisan effort . 
i look forward to sending the bill to committee and listening to the constructive suggestions of all members of parliament that would permit us to improve the bill , providing that the amendments amend the same acts as those referred to in the bill . 
i urge all members of the House to join in support of the bill and to send it to committee . 
i believe that together we will make it such to maintain one of Canada ' s most important pieces of legislation as our country and our democracy moves into the 21 st century . 
i thank hon. members for all the work they have done thus far on improving the Canada Elections Act . 
i look forward to appearing before the committee , answering all questions from hon. members and working together with them to make this bill better for all Canadians . 
Mr. Ted White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
in the spirit that has been shown by the government House leader , I wonder if the House would give unanimous consent to question the minister for five minutes . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not object to that , but we are only limited to three hours and I would be taking away other members ' time . 
i am appearing before the committee in a few days . 
i can do it either way , it is the same for me . 
i just do not want to take up other members ' time . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
perhaps we can clarify it . 
is there unanimous consent to proceed with questions to the minister at this time for five minutes ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i did not hear any nos . 
is someone saying no to the proposal ? 
no one is saying no . 
we will therefore have a five minute question period . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron : 
Mr. Speaker , I understand the concerns of my hon. colleague , the government House leader , and I must say that , up to a certain point , I share them . 
if question and comment period is limited to only five minutes , it is obvious that all political parties will lose out . 
if we were to agree on , say , five minutes for each party , then I could agree but otherwise not . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
five minutes each . 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a shame that we would not get the chance right at the beginning of this debate to ask the minister a few questions . 
it would help clarify the issues . 
even if we all had to give up a half minute of our time , it would have helped to focus the debate . 
the practice of referring bills to committee prior to second reading frankly is nothing more than a way for the government to fast track legislation that it really does not want the public and the media to get a good handle on . 
i know that I am not allowed to use props , but we are looking at a bill that is 253 pages thick . 
this bill was introduced last Thursday in the House by the minister and just a few days later he wants to ram it into committee behind closed doors where the public and the media cannot see it . 
it is so full of objectionable stuff that he does not want anyone in the real world to catch on to what is happening . 
the government House leader is denying the public and the media the opportunity to hear a meaningful debate of the extensive provisions in the bill before it goes to committee . 
how are the public and interested parties going to get enough information about this bill to come to committee and make meaningful comments , answer questions and suggest amendments when they are not going to know the bill is here ? 
the reality of the situation is that when this bill disappears later today after the vote into committee , nobody except a few special interest groups - and if they can get a few talk show hosts or media commentators to talk about it - will know it even exists . 
that is an absolutely appalling situation for such a comprehensive piece of legislation . 
in the six years I have been in the House I have seen very few pieces of legislation that have been this thick . 
one of them would be the gun control bill , Bill C - 68 , some years ago . 
look how long that bill took to move through the House . 
here we have something that is going through in a flash . 
if I had had the opportunity a few minutes ago , I would have asked the minister a couple of questions in connection with the Communist Party of Canada challenge to the elections act and the number of members that constitute a party . 
why is it that the government House leader is so concerned that the Communist Party of Canada or the Green Party of Canada might actually have its party name on the ballot ? 
what is the minister so afraid of that he wants to reinstate a rule that requires 50 candidates for a group to be labelled as a party ? 
why on earth is there anything wrong with two , three or 10 people getting together and saying they would like to be the such and such party and have their name printed on the ballot ? 
is the House leader so afraid of competition that he cannot stand the thought that some other credible group might actually be on the ballot ? 
if we look at Germany or New Zealand , both of which have mixed member proportional systems in their elections , or any other country that has a proportional element in its electoral system , there are up to 35 parties on the ballot . 
yet the voters in those countries seem perfectly capable of making sensible decisions about which parties to elect and which to reject . 
why would the government House leader believe that Canadian voters are too stupid to make those same decisions ? 
surely when he stood there and argued that the final decision should be that of the Canadian voter , why does he not let them make that decision ? 
put anybody ' s name on the ballot , anybody who wants to apply under the rules and pay the candidate deposit . 
let them put whatever name they want on the ballot and let the voters decide . 
i certainly believe that voters are sensible and smart enough to make that decision themselves . 
another question I would have asked the minister is in connection with patronage which riddles like a web the field operations of Elections Canada . 
elections Canada has begged the government for years to remove the patronage provisions from the elections act . 
when Elections Canada advises third world governments and emerging democracies how to set up their electoral systems , it never recommends the system that is used here in Canada of political patronage in all of the field positions of Elections Canada . 
the government will not give it the right because it suits the government to reward political supporters . 
the government House leader mentioned that he is going to give ROs the right to vote . 
i guess they must be afraid they do not have enough votes already so they have to claw in every single vote they can get . 
it amuses and puzzles me that the government is prepared to ignore court decisions in B.C. that allow child pornography to run rampant . 
the government is quite prepared to ignore court decisions that endorse race based fisheries , but it rushes quickly to block any tiny little court decision that might diminish its advantage in elections , such as the 50 candidate rule and the third party expenses . 
it wants to retain the patronage . 
it pays lip service to democracy but its actions speak a lot louder than its words . 
i mentioned the size of the bill . 
we have already started to contact a few parties , groups and individuals who have shown interest in the bill . 
we have not even been able to send them copies of the bill until yesterday by courier . 
the minister wants to appear before committee as early as this Thursday . 
how can we expect it to be reasonable for interested people in the country , who may or may not have legal training , to go through 253 pages of a complicated bill , work out the implications for their group or part of society , prepare submissions , apply to come to Ottawa and transport themselves here by Thursday or maybe next week ? 
when the committee begins discussions on the timetable for the bill , I hope it will show some reasonable consideration for those outside this place who are interested and who would like to come here as witnesses and talk about the provisions in the bill . 
i hope the committee will have a realistic timetable that will perhaps extend into the spring of next year . 
i do not see why we should rush through on something as complicated as this bill . 
an hon. member : 
maybe there is a snap election coming . 
Mr. Ted White : 
one of my colleagues on this side says that there may be is a snap election election coming . 
it is interesting that he says that because I notice Bill C - 2 , which is pretty much a replacement for Bill C - 83 , which was introduced just before we broke for the summer and ended the first session , contains an extra couple of clauses that were not in Bill C - 83 . 
those clauses deal with the registration of and reporting of parties prior to June 2000 if the bill is passed before then . 
when I read those clauses , I just wondered if some sort of quick election was being planned and the government wants to make sure that certain things are in place by June of next year . 
it is interesting that my colleague mentioned that . 
i am not sure if he read those clauses but that was certainly there . 
even the debate we are having this morning is an affront to democracy . 
the House leader stood and talked about the democratic process and how he supports it . 
however the debate we are having now is an affront to democracy . 
we do not get to ask any questions of any speaker on the government side . 
we get the opportunity to put up four people , 10 minutes each , no questions and comments , have a vote that the government side will win and it is rammed into committee . 
we have all been here long enough to know exactly what will happen behind closed doors . 
we are all adults . 
it will be back here in the House again in its final form . 
that is just not good enough . 
it is simply to build in the opportunity for the chief electoral officer to investigate and experiment with electronic voting . 
i look forward to being in committee . 
i also look forward to a meaningful debate once the bill is back in the House . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with pleasure that I rise today to take part in the preliminary debate on Bill C - 2 , an act respecting the election of members to the House of Commons , repealing other acts relating to elections and making consequential amendments to other acts . 
i would like to point out that , in preparation for this bill , no fewer than 14 sittings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs were spent considering the present Canada Elections Act during this parliament . 
given our detailed and careful study , we were entitled to expect that the government would pay particular attention to the various recommendations formulated by the standing committee , but this did not seem to be entirely the case . 
to begin with , when we considered the Canada Elections Act , I was struck by two things in particular : funding of political parties , and the corollary issue of trust funds established to support candidates . 
no less important , I would say that the partisan process for appointing electoral officers also leaves me confused . 
under the Canada Elections Act , small and large corporations have always been able to contribute to the funding of federal political parties . 
this practice allows the various parties to amass huge sums , while making it less necessary to approach individual voters for money . 
as they do not have to keep to a contribution limit , corporations may contribute huge sums to the federal political parties of their choice , and , need I point out , these contributions certainly do not go to political parties for purely philanthropic purposes . 
the funding of political parties , as practised federally , necessarily implies preferential treatment for the most generous , and God knows just how generous they can be under the law . 
i simply want to say that , with a simple contribution of a few dollars , the ordinary voter runs the risk of not having the ear of his political representatives to the same extent as a bank , which , for example , may make substantial contributions of up to several tens of thousands of dollars . 
the situation creates different categories of contributors , and , unfortunately , different levels of attention to the many requests and expectations political leaders must address . 
today , we are considering a bill , which , according to the government , aims at , and I quote : " equity , transparency and accessibility '' . 
i might question that . 
how can the government claim that this process is equitable , when the provisions of the bill do not establish any sort of limit for contributions ? 
who could claim , without raising an eyebrow , that this system is truly equitable , transparent and accessible , a system that allows corporations , which do not have the right to vote , to meddle in the electoral process by making contributions far beyond the capability of the ordinary voter , and thus unduly influencing the political policy of the parties and the candidates seeking votes ? 
this bill runs counter to a narrow concept of the rules of democracy that should govern our society , since it still gives its wealthier members a more attentive ear and a greater voice with those representing the public . 
as I mentioned in the introduction , having a trust fund to support candidates seems to be nebulous at the very least . 
another financial matter , you will say . 
this point was unanimously recommended by the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs when the federal electoral legislation was studied . 
the members of the committee wanted the government to clarify the rules governing this practice , which may make it possible to circumvent the already lax provisions of the election act on funding of political parties . 
well , not a word ; nothing we recommended on the subject appears in the bill we are now considering . 
so what is the point of in depth examination in preparation for bills such as this one , if the government merely nods and takes from our deliberations only those elements that suit it and which it had already in all likelihood decided to legislate ? 
does this mean that the work and recommendations of the committees are only recognized and implemented when they meet cabinet ' s expectations ? 
but the Liberals decided not to endorse that recommendation and one wonders why . 
i will now address the appointment process of electoral officers , which is another example of transparency that is opaque , to say the least . 
how can the government claim to have a transparent electoral process when returning officers are all appointed by the governor in council , that is by the party in office ? 
the Bloc Quebecois can only deplore the partisan nature of these appointments , something which is unacceptable in a process as democratic as an election . 
the government preferred to keep this eminently partisan instrument , which it can use to its advantage , instead of leaving the electoral process in the hands of qualified , non - partisan and objective people . 
can one truly believe that a returning officer appointed by the party in office will be unbiased ? 
i have doubts about that in many cases . 
and what about the provisions dealing with third party interventions , which set a spending limit only for costs related to advertising ? 
when it considered issues such as the ones I mentioned earlier , my party came to the conclusion that the expressions " reform " and " in - depth review of the elections act " were somewhat exaggerated . 
it has been over 30 years since the Canada Elections Act last underwent any serious overhaul . 
the government claims to have put forth the so - called principles of equity , transparency and accessibility , when in fact it did nothing more than indulge in a primarily self - serving exercise at the expense of the voters that it should be serving . 
government members missed a good opportunity to demonstrate that they really had democratization of the electoral process at heart . 
it seemed to those of us in the Bloc Quebecois that , after thirty years of elections under this legislation , a serious reform could , and should , be undertaken . 
having experienced , in this last year of the millennium , the Liberal regime and its twenty - five gags imposed in the first session of the 36 th Parliament alone , it would be daydreaming o believe that the government truly intended to carry out any real modernization of the electoral system . 
i will take this opportunity to express the wish that , despite the somewhat singular character of the legislative process in which we are currently engaged in order to pass bill C - 2 , the government will truly pay attention to the concerns expressed by the witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , that it will be open to proposed amendments it might receive from the various parties in this House , and that it will be prepared to truly make this process , this operation to revise the federal election legislation , a process devoted to truly democratizing the electoral system in Canada . 
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak on Bill C - 2 which is the first major overhaul of the Canada Elections Act since 1970 . 
MPs are very interested in the minute details of the bill because it is one of the key rule books for the sport of politics and the business of politics . 
i will put the bill ' s importance into some kind of context . 
the biggest single difference between Canadian rules in elections and U.S. rules in elections is the fact that we have reasonable campaign spending limits in Canada . 
in the U.S. spending limits are stratospheric . 
one does not have to be a billionaire like Donald Trump , Ross Perot , Steven Forbes or Oprah Winfrey to run an election campaign in Canada as one would have to be in the U.S. We do not have to spend most of our time as elected members of parliament sucking up to the political action committees of various lobby groups that have the power to raise money for our campaigns or to spend millions of dollars to defeat us over some narrow issue . 
it is true that we are seeing a few Americanisms entering our process on a small scale . 
if the National Citizens ' Coalition and the Reform Party had their way we would have even more . 
they want American style health care and American style politics to help them get it . 
let us be proud of the following point . 
it cost Barbara Boxer $ 22 million U.S. to win her senate seat in California . 
that amount and more will be spent by both Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani as they run for the vacant New York senate seat . 
we have these spending limits in part because David Lewis and the NDP were foresighted enough make them part of their price for supporting the minority Liberal government in 1974 . 
U.S. style campaign financing makes running for office an impossibility for ordinary citizens like most of us in the House . 
another benchmark is if the provision encourages us to concentrate in the public interest and the public good , rather than endless fundraising from special interests . 
then it is worthy of our support . 
there are many changes in the act that the NDP supports . 
we support the national riding limits on third party advertising and the requirement to identify their sponsors . 
we believe uncontrolled advertising would distort elections in favour of those groups which can afford million dollar ad campaigns at the expense of democracy . 
without this clause we would have the U.S. style financing to which I referred . 
we also support polling blackouts during the last 48 hours of the campaign . 
poll results are capable of being manipulated and the parties involved need to be given sufficient time to respond to published findings so the public can get the whole story . 
we support the changes which do not automatically deregister parties and thereby force the sale of assets if that political party for one election could not muster a slate of at least 50 candidates . 
we strongly support the increases in the federal political contribution tax credit limits for individuals . 
this is an inclusionary policy . 
another positive change is the fact that all candidates are now eligible for the return of the $ 1,000 nomination deposit once the appropriate election expense returns are filed with Elections Canada . 
previously candidates needed to get 15 % of the vote or they would lose their deposit . 
official agents can be fired and replaced if necessary during a campaign and nomination papers can now be filed electronically or by fax . 
for our urban friends , the right of access for candidates and their volunteers to campaign in condos and apartments is strengthened . 
we also support the changes which make it administratively easier for political parties to merge . 
unfortunately , for the Leader of the Opposition , it cannot be made politically any easier for him , at least not in this piece of legislation . 
however , there are two changes which we oppose , and there are some glaring omissions . 
we cannot support the elimination of so - called " rural vouching '' . 
people who live in the city often do not know their neighbours . 
they grew up together , went to school together , farm together , do business together and are usually related to one another . 
if Georgina says that Kaye got left off the list because she does not live on the farm any more , then everyone will take her word for it because that is the way things are . 
some people can tell a lie to a stranger , some people cannot , but it is just about impossible to get away with telling a fib to a DRO , a poll clerk and three or four party scrutineers from your home town ; any or all of whom could easily catch you out . 
i know we will find the same thing next time in places like downtown Vancouver and , in particular , Vancouver East . 
if we do not reintroduce some mandatory enumeration of polls with a high proportion of renters or tenants we may wind up with the American situation where only rich people and homeowners get around to registering and voting . 
that would be a shame , unfair and undemocratic . 
the other provision I cannot support and my party cannot support relates to returning officers . 
they are now able to vote , which is okay , but they are still appointed by the government . 
this is significant because they hold the job until they die or the riding boundaries change . 
these positions should be awarded after a competition on the basis of merit . 
a whole new merit system would be quite a refreshing change in the House of Commons . 
it is the only way to maintain the appearance of neutrality , as well as the practice . 
what is missing ? 
there were several issues omitted from this review of the elections act , a number of which are very important to the New Democratic Party . 
at our recent policy convention we adopted a paper on democratic reform which made a number of recommendations , including promoting a form of proportional representation as appropriate for our country . 
a system of proportional representation would contribute to the Canadian sense that the House of Commons belonged to them and would reduce regional frictions , resulting in a more dynamic and equitable democracy in Canada , which is another refreshing suggestion . 
the government and the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs decided not to examine proportional representation , or PR as we call it , in spite of a very thorough presentation by my colleague , the member for Regina - Qu ' Appelle , and a lot of interest around the table . 
given the level of cynicism about politics these days it is a pretty grave omission . 
people feel their vote does not count when the allocation of seats in parliament does not fairly reflect the distribution of the popular vote . 
a modified system of PR , where most of the seats in the commons were still constituency based but a portion were allocated under a regional or percentage basis under a PR system , could go some way toward relieving this imbalance . 
pr would overcome some of the arguments about regional or provincial representation made by some defenders of the unelected , undemocratic Senate . 
we would like to see the idea of fixed election dates reviewed as well . 
our convention and our party supports this . 
this would remove one of the advantages that an incumbent political party has over every other political party in the country . 
finally , the voting age has not been lowered in this version of the act . 
the Liberals have been trumpeting their so - called children ' s agenda . 
in my view , let the young people vote on the children ' s agenda . 
in fact , it would be interesting to see how often all party leaders volunteered to campaign in high schools if these students could actually vote . 
young people are thought responsible enough to drive at age 16 . 
they can be held responsible for committing violent criminal acts in adult court . 
more than that , they will have to live with the long term implications of decisions taken by the parliament of today . 
unfortunately , they are taken seriously enough by other parties in the House , some of which have been known to offer kids a free bus trip , pizza and a bit of booze to skip school and wave the flag . 
i believe that young people will live up to the expectations we have of them and will not disappoint us . 
many support lowering the voting age to 16 , including my colleague , the member for Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , as well as the New Democratic Youth of Canada , the Nova Scotia NDP and many other organizations around the country . 
finally , one thing we would like to see addressed , which was raised by my colleague from Palliser , is the use of a private person ' s likeness without permission in an advertisement during a campaign . 
this should not be allowed . 
we will work to see that this happens . 
i am glad to hear the government House leader say that he is prepared to co - operate on these issues . 
this week we are celebrating co - operatives week and I am pleased to see that the government House leader will co - operate with all parties to make some changes to this very important act . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to follow my hon. colleague . 
he has hit a very important tone ; that is , on an issue such as this there should certainly be an element of co - operation 
i also appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly to Bill C - 2 , formerly Bill C - 83 , an act to replace the Canada Elections Act . 
as has been pointed out by previous speakers , this is the first attempt in over 30 years to address this problem . 
the way in which this country elects its representatives is the cornerstone of democracy . 
it is important to examine closely all of the ways in which those changes would impact on our system . 
to repeat what has been said earlier , this attempt , although perhaps the bill itself may appear at first blush as being rather cumbersome and lengthy , is a very important exercise as we engage in looking at some of these changes . 
such legislation is required to update the language , add new provisions and recognize the content to reflect changes in the political landscape . 
Roger Gibbons , a noted and highly respected political scientist and author , said that in most instances there is very little incentive to change a system that is on the government ' s side , a system that was responsible for electing it . 
i give the government some credit for having taken this bold initiative . 
time will tell as to whether some of these suggested changes toward making the process more democratic will actually come to fruition . 
canada ' s electoral laws in their current form , while still very effective , do require updating . 
we know that just 38 % of the Canada population elected the current government , which resulted in this very precarious majority government system that we now have . 
i will not take the time of the House to review the bill in great depth that we are sending off to committee because it is at committee where this study will really get down to the nuts and bolts . 
however , I will point out a number of the positive elements as well as some of the areas of the bill that the Progressive Conservative Party takes issue with . 
first , we are pleased to see that third party spending limits have been reintroduced to the $ 150,000 maximum , with no more than $ 3,000 against the individual candidate . 
the PC Party is also pleased to see that measures have been taken to control Internet advertising . 
one needs only to mention the issue of child pornography and other particular broadcasts that are taking place on the Internet to highlight the fact that this is an area that has to be examined very carefully . 
the potential for abuse is very real . 
bill C - 2 would eliminate the possibility of adding or deleting content from political parties ' election websites after a blackout period , which is 72 to 48 hours . 
just as with the Internet , the emergence of polls as an important communication tool is another element that cannot be ignored . 
the release of polls in relation to the proximity of election day has been an ongoing source of concern and frustration both for the elector and the electorate . 
i am very pleased therefore to see that the provisions in the bill would require an individual or polling company who releases a poll during a writ period to provide an in - depth analysis of the poll itself , speaking to the voracity , I suggest , and the importance of the accuracy of the information being relayed . 
one can only hope that this measure would dramatically reduce the number of polls that are perhaps based on inaccurate or inadequate data . 
i also believe that it is important that the media take greater responsibility in clearly outlining the poll ' s methodology and how the findings were reported . 
another very positive change that has been alluded to is the changing of the voting hours , particularly in the province of Saskatchewan , but I suggest it is as important in Chicoutimi as it is in Antigonish or anywhere in the country . 
an interesting addition to the legislation that is not contained in Bill C - 2 would be to require the chief electoral officer to notify the leader of a political party of any outstanding filings from candidates . 
this , I believe , would be consistent with the efforts to be more transparent and open as to how all financial matters are being conducted . 
the Conservative Party supports the initiative of the chief electoral officer to provide candidates with an estimation of the spending limits in their respective ridings . 
greater clarity and understanding of the rules of engagement are extremely important to running efficient , effective and honest elections . 
this is certainly a tool that would assist candidates as they undertake their election preparedness . 
an examination of the finances that takes place in Bill C - 2 is an extremely important part of the legislation . 
increased accountability , increased accessibility , transparency and all of those fine watch words that we hear have to be more than just words . 
to quote the previous speaker , there is a high degree of cynicism that exists about the process that of course flows into a degree of cynicism about politics in general . 
if we can address this at the outset , early in the process , the process that is responsible for each and every member of the House arriving here in Ottawa as a representative , it will perhaps help to stem , to a degree , the cynicism that does exist . 
being able to identify how much money is given to parties will allow for scrutiny . 
it is perhaps important as well to look at the raising of the thresholds for 75 % of political tax credits from $ 100 to $ 200 . 
we have some concerns with respect to the publishing of contributor ' s names and specific information about where they are doing business , their location and the ways in which they may be contacted . 
this may be a disincentive for some and if we want to encourage people to participate on a financial level in the process I think there has to be some respect for confidentiality . 
however , this will be dealt with in greater detail at the committee . 
the return of the $ 1,000 candidate ' s deposit also encourages people to participate in the actual process because this is the basic threshold that a person has to cross to enter into the fray . 
the return of the $ 1,000 deposit is an important change . 
the current legislation simply requires that a name be provided when a donation is made . 
bill C - 2 , just to hearken back to my earlier point , now requires that an individual must provide addresses for publication . 
there has been a lot of debate outside of the House in a different context , and it is not something that the Conservative Party has pursued . 
my initial interpretation of the section in Bill C - 2 dealing with mergers requires simply that two political parties wishing to merge obtain a signature of two leaders in respective parties . 
i can think of a personal example where that will not happen . 
a 30 - day waiting period is then imposed . 
however , there is some concern that when an election is called , that the merger itself would be nullified . 
so there is some nebulous content in the bill respecting mergers . 
i believe we may be heading down a slippery slope if we were to accept carte blanche what is currently in the legislation . 
while the principle behind this is sound , it is imperative that the mandate and the position of this particular person be clarified in the legislation . 
the role of the registered district agent or auditor has far - reaching powers and it is something that must be clarified . 
we are also aware of the seriousness of electoral fraud . 
we know it can be a problem . 
we must therefore empower those auditors and individuals entrusted with the role of overseeing elections with the ability to act and act with clarity and force . 
however , those powers must be carefully examined before they are laid down . 
i think there was mention of the difference between rural and the vouching for individuals . 
we recognize that there is in some instances in rural communities the ability of a neighbour to come and vouch for a person but there should be some clarity and perhaps a method for doing so . 
i am encouraged that the government has recognized this as an area for change to produce a more democratic , better functioning electoral system . 
i look forward to taking part in the debate at the committee and look forward to waiting to see how the government will react to the input that it will receive no doubt from all members of the opposition . 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I am particularly pleased to be able to speak in the debate on the new Canada elections bill . 
i was the chair of procedure and House affairs last year when we dealt with this matter on a preliminary basis . 
it has already been mentioned by some members of the opposition that this is a large bill . 
the fact of the matter is that this is one of the underpinnings of our democracy . 
our legislation and Elections Canada are a model to the world . 
people come to Ottawa regularly from other countries to examine how we do things . 
it has been 30 years since there was a comprehensive review of this important piece of legislation . 
over those years , of course , given the changes in technology and in communications across the country , all sorts of smaller changes have been made to it , trying to keep it up to date and so on . 
i am particularly pleased at this time that the government has seen fit not just to fix parts of it but to take this very basic piece of legislation and develop what is essentially a new act . 
the time is right for that given the changes of the last three decades . 
the process on how this was done has been mentioned . 
it was unusual , and I realize that it may be difficult for some opposition members to understand . 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , which is the committee responsible in the House for the Canada Elections Act , conducted an elaborate review of this last year . 
i recommend the report that resulted from that review to all members of the House and to anybody watching this on television . 
i recommend it not because it provides all the answers or that it provides a sort of complete blueprint from which this new legislation was taken , but because it presents all the views of registered parties , members of parliament , members of the House and others who appeared before the committee . 
the report does not say one way or the other how it should be done . 
the report , which involved very wide consultation in the House and beyond , provided the basis for the drafters of the legislation , which was very useful to them . 
during the committee ' s consultations , we did not start with a blank space . 
we had before us the work of our predecessors over the last 30 years in the House of Commons , for example the Lortie commission which the minister mentioned . 
we considered the recommendations of the Lortie commission , many of which have not been acted upon , with great care and included them in the committee ' s report . 
we also considered the recommendations of the special committee of the House which dealt with electoral matters only a few years ago . 
we considered those and they are also referenced in the report . 
the drafters had the Lortie commission , the recommendations of the special committee of the House and the general framework laid out based on the consultations of last year ' s Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . 
now , continuing the process , the minister wants the bill to go directly to committee for further consultation not only with members of the House but , as usual , by holding public hearings with people across the country . 
there will be further input . 
i commend the minister for that . 
it is very courageous and appropriate to get the bill into committee now so it can be debated by all members of the House . 
we have now heard from the minister and a number of members of the opposition parties . 
there was criticism of course from the opposition parties but it was constructive criticism . 
because it is a very thick document , I would like to point out the sorts of things the bill is trying to deal with . 
in doing that I underestimate the bill in some ways . 
it is not a bill that simply fixes bits and pieces of the legislation . 
it is a bill that rewrites the legislation to fit with the modern era . 
nevertheless , I will mention some of the specific points . 
let me give some examples of the way people as voters will benefit from the legislation . 
Canadian voters temporarily abroad will be able to submit their ballots at embassies and consulates . 
the legislation has not been revised for 30 years . 
thirty years ago it would have been very difficult to administer a system like this . 
one can well imagine people in remote embassies trying to get a valid vote back into Canada . 
it could have been quite difficult and could have delayed the process . 
we now need something easier so that is being done . 
the minister made the point about signs in multiple dwelling units . 
we know we can canvass in buildings which are like small communities in some of our cities . 
people live in those communities . 
the modern reality is that many of us live in multiple dwellings . 
it is very appropriate that those of us who do live in those dwellings have the same chance to advertise and show our political affiliation as the people who live in single or small units . 
if members think about the changes over the last 30 years , they think about the role of polls . 
polls are now part of modern life like so many other things . 
maybe in the backs of our minds we would like to turn the clock back to when polls did not exist but they do exist . 
it is now possible to sample thousands of people in a very short time and very quickly put the results of that sampling in front of people as they are watching TV at night . 
this is now recognized in the legislation today . 
the legislation does not ban polls or anything of that sort . 
among other things , it states that during an election campaign when a poll first appears , the first time it is mentioned in the campaign , the methodology , that is the exact way in which the poll was conducted , will have to be given to the public . 
we will know if is a straw poll and it is somebody selling hamburgers and counting the hamburgers that are red or blue or whatever the methodology may be , or if it truly is a statistically based sampling of people in all regions , people of all ages , people of different income groups and those types of thing . 
i think it is very appropriate nowadays because the general public is well informed about such things . 
now , when a poll first appears in an election , the methodology will be described and it will allow us all to judge the reliability of the results of that polls . 
third parties are groups that are not registered and have no running candidates in an election , but want to be able to advertise on a particular issue in a certain constituency . 
this is a fundamental piece of legislation . 
the process so far has been very positive and open . 
it is my sense that when this gets to committee it will create great interest and input from all members . 
i look forward to the discussions . 
i urge all members to move forward so that at the end of this process we will have a new , even stronger Canada Elections Act . 
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) : 
the idea that a ruling party seeks to restrict the ability of any other person or group to counter government propaganda during an election is frankly evil . 
the government currently uses its advertising to an unfair advantage . 
the population of the country knows them well . 
i do not understand why a government is allowed to use taxpayer funding to get themselves re - elected . 
i think that is wrong . 
citizens should be able to enforce provisions by filing complaints with Elections Canada to prevent governments from doing those types of things with taxpayer funds . 
another aspect I would like to touch on is the whole idea of patronage . 
elections Canada as an instrument of democracy is rife with people who are chosen by the government to do its bidding during elections . 
i cannot think of a better example in government of a totally patronage ridden system . 
other countries would be wise never to copy such a thing . 
with regard to spending limits , two separate court decisions in Alberta have struck down spending limits as unconstitutional . 
it is not the place of the government to limit the right of an individual Canadian or a group of Canadians to spend their own money in support of an idea . 
there is a saying that nothing is so important as an idea whose time has come , but you can bet that this government will toss as many roadblocks and obstacles at the success of an idea as it possibly can . 
spending limits only really serve the interests of the governing party . 
i will elaborate on that later . 
regarding registered party status , in March an Ontario court struck down requirements that would force a party to run 50 candidates in order to have its candidates listed with party affiliation on the ballot . 
by what rationale are two candidates or more not sufficient to be recognized as a political party ? 
this is why . 
it is because the governing party likes big parties . 
the Liberals like the idea that you cannot start up small and expand and it does not like competition . 
that is the reason these rules have been put in . 
it goes so far as to require the liquidation of a party ' s assets and to send the money to the receiver general for failure to run 50 candidates in an election . 
how dare they . 
why not let the voters rather than the government decide who they want to represent them ? 
it is nothing but a clear attempt to stifle the formation and growth of new parties and to limit competition on the ballot . 
that is exactly what the Liberals are saying by this legislation . 
instead it centralizes power and requires the signature of party leaders in order to perform some sort of local merger . 
it disallows the idea of local decisions and local self - determination . 
on the idea of voter identification , currently an electoral official may ask for proof of identification but a voter can take an oath instead . 
imagine the strange and bizarre scenario where a homeless friend of the prime minister could arrive at a voting station and say " I do not have any proof of my eligibility to vote or proof of residence '' . 
" what is your name , sir ? " 
" John Crouton '' . 
" where do you live , sir ? " 
" 24 Sucks Us Drive , Ottawa , Ontario '' . 
and that person may be eligible to vote . 
that is a travesty in our democracy . 
that type of abuse could go on at our polling stations . 
identification should be shown to prove eligibility and residence . 
that is only fair . 
it substantiates our right to vote and gives it some validity . 
i will talk about taxpayer subsidies . 
there should be no reimbursement for those types of things . 
on the issue of byelections , the legislation reads now that byelections must be called within six months but not held within six months . 
the distinction is it allows the ruling party to time byelections according to its own circumstances which it does all too well . 
with new computerized voters lists there is no problem with holding elections within six months and indeed that has been done . 
i will quote a few different sources which I think eloquently back up some of the things I have been talking about today , some of the travesties which I think are being done to our elections act and to democracy . 
a person who says that kind of thing is probably the type of person who wants to bring forward legislation that would restrict freedom of speech and restrict competition on the ballot . 
i do not doubt that for a second . 
these people want to control the election agenda . 
they want to ensure that political parties themselves , particularly the government party , can establish the agenda of an election . 
unfortunately I note that I only have one minute left in my time . 
i would like to quickly read into the record the type of subsidies that go on and who they benefit . 
people should do what they can to fight this legislation . 
i urge those who challenge it in the courts to please do so . 
i hope that even though legislation like this was brought forward by Trudeau in 1983 , again by the Conservative government when it was in office and by the NDP in British Columbia , that it once again will be thrown out as unconstitutional by the courts of this land . 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , it is always a privilege to take part in a debate as important as the one we are conducting today . 
the vast majority of the measures in the bill are as a result of a long broad based , painstaking consultation process . 
today we are referring this bill , the new Canada Elections Act , to committee before second reading . 
the results of the consultation were subjected to careful analysis by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . 
the proposed amendments to the current Canada Elections Act stem directly from that analysis which was performed by members of all parties represented in this Chamber . 
our first responsibility as parliamentarians is therefore to pass those improvements into law and give Canada an elections act which is suited to the society of today and more important still , to the society of tomorrow . 
we should bear in mind that the new elections act we pass will govern the election of the first government of the next millennium . 
our second responsibility and no less important , far from it , is to uphold Canada ' s role in the eyes of the whole world as a leader in democracy . 
the virtues of our democratic system are known and recognized the world over . 
in this area as others , Canada has served as a model , one which is acclaimed at home and indeed abroad . 
although we have a firmly established reputation for democracy , we must always work continually to maintain it . 
our whole democratic system in its fullest and most noble expression rests first and foremost on our electoral process , the very process which is our task to perfect here today . 
no matter how strong our collective commitment as members of parliament to the shared cause of serving Canadians may be , there will always be new circumstances , special situations , unforeseen snags and impediments along the way . 
simply the process of social change , the pace of which has increased exponentially as a right of technological explosion , makes a periodic review necessary . 
the amendments before us today are in keeping with the existing act ' s three hallmarks : fairness , transparency and accessibility . 
they relate chiefly to the three distinctive areas of administrative adjustments , publication bans and spending by third parties during election campaigns . 
on the last point , the courts have found some aspects of the act to be too restrictive and incompatible with the charter of rights and freedoms . 
we believe this is fundamentally unfair . 
the second main issue of the bill deals with the matter of publication bans which have also been contested in the courts . 
the regulations concerning partisan advertising and the publication of public opinion polls have been the subject of various court challenges . 
as I have mentioned , the first major component of the bill relates to various changes of a basically administrative nature . 
here more than anywhere else the three great principles of fairness , transparency and accessibility apply and are in evidence . 
we had previously settled the problems relating to the release of election results and closing of polling stations given the existence of different time zones in Canada . 
however , we had not dealt with the special case of Saskatchewan which , unlike the other western provinces , does not move its clocks forward in summer . 
the bill provides for this adjustment . 
the third point relates to urban concentration . 
multi - unit buildings , condominiums and homes for the aged are proliferating in some towns and are home to a growing number of voters . 
we are proposing in Bill C - 2 to let candidates campaign in dwellings of that type and to let tenants or owners , as the case may be , put up posters and signs . 
it has been my experience that certain boards of condominiums have instituted private bylaws prohibiting canvassing which then is enforced by security guards . 
i was involved in one situation where the security guard was fired for having let canvassers into the building . 
our existing Canada Elections Act is an exceptional , remarkably effective document which has served Canadians well for many years . 
many other countries in the world would like to be able to say the same . 
it remains however , like many other laws , that it needs to be updated periodically . 
some of its provisions are 30 years old . 
as I have pointed out , the changes before us are based on a thorough analysis of the situation performed by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , an analysis which I think we can all agree is untainted by partisanship . 
that analysis yielded a number of suggestions and in some cases , conclusions which were included in the committee ' s nearly unanimous report . 
based on that report the government framed the new measures that are being proposed to improve the Canada Elections Act . 
personally , I believe these new measure will achieve their purpose . 
i am convinced that in the medium term and the long term the new provisions will raise the quality of our democratic system to a still higher level . 
the main purpose of a new elections act is to build democratic respect for the rights and freedoms of a country ' s citizens and let all citizens freely choose the people who will represent them , defend their rights and ultimately ensure their quality of life . 
i wholeheartedly recommend passage of the bill in its entirety . 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , after the Constitution Act , the Canada Elections Act is , without a doubt , the cornerstone of our democracy . 
the purpose of this act , which encompasses the entire electoral process , is to ensure that the rules of democracy are respected so that the House of Commons reflects , as faithfully as possible , the wishes expressed by voters . 
this act has not been overhauled in over 30 years . 
it was time , and we might have expected Bill C - 2 to opt clearly for transparency . 
on reading it , however , we are forced to admit that , for this government , there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip . 
the transparency is still veiled ; I would even go so far as to say that the veils number at least seven . 
there are 577 clauses in the present bill . 
for the initial consideration of some 250 pages of text , before Bill C - 2 is referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs , 301 parliamentarians will have a total of 180 minutes : three hours of debate . 
this will allow a mere 6 % of elected members to speak . 
given that nine of 18 opportunities to speak go to the government party , that leaves nine for the four opposition parties . 
already , the decision to go with this entirely parliamentary rule might suggest that the government is not too inclined to hear what the opposition might have to say on this subject . 
during the few minutes allotted to me , I would like to draw particular attention to two points that we feel are fundamental but which are striking by their very absence : democratic funding of political parties , and the method of appointing returning officers . 
for over 20 years , Quebec has been able to take just pride in having had the courage to clean up party funding by allowing only individual voters to contribute to party coffers . 
the contribution limit is set at $ 3,000 per voter . 
the Quebec legislation , which has been in effect for over 20 years , has been proven effective and we are sorry that Bill C - 2 shows not even the hint of a desire to take a similar approach . 
however , not a month goes by that events do not make us think that perhaps the influence of contributors to the government ' s electoral fund is directly proportional to the size of their cheque . 
is it simply by chance that the Minister of Transport is on good terms with the president of Onex ? 
the question is put ; it is up to you to come up with hypotheses . 
clearly , the bill before us today will not increase the public ' s confidence in the political parties . 
the old adage " Them that has gets " has not lost its meaning entirely . 
so long as corporations , both large and small , can contribute to the electoral coffers as they like , with no restriction , democracy will be at risk . 
for a country that wants to be the best and prides itself on being so , the federal approach to funding in this bill is an obvious blight on democracy . 
in 75 days or so , we will be in the next millennium . 
how can we not regret the fact that this government prefers the status quo to clearly opting for transparency ? 
not only is the ordinary individual ' s perception of elected officials not improved , but , more importantly , democracy would come out ahead with legislation that recognized the vital need to give back to voters and to them alone the responsibility for the vitality of the political parties . 
the second matter I would like to draw your attention to is that of the selection of returning officers . 
far be it from me to cast any doubt whatsoever on the ability of the governor in council to make valid recommendations in this connection . 
moreover , making the number of appointments of all kinds that fall under its jurisdiction must be a full time job . 
yet the fact that appointments of returning officers are perceived as political appointments in itself casts some doubt on the impartiality of these appointments . 
the role of returning officer is key to the entire electoral process . 
he is responsible for applying the legislation and for settling any conflicts . 
as everyone is aware , a decision can satisfy some and stir up controversy with others . 
just how wise is it to maintain a controversial system of appointment rather than assigning this responsibility to a committee which would examine applications for the position submitted in a competition ? 
could a candidate defeated in a previous federal election be appointed returning officer ? 
there have already been appointments as surprising as this within the present selection process . 
it is not unreasonable to believe that a committee would select from among the candidates the person best fitting the requirements of ability plus impartiality . 
and if , by chance , a former Bloc Quebecois candidate were to become a returning officer , there is a good chance that he or she would make an excellent one . 
that is a choice that we regret . 
on the 18 th century , Montesquieu wrote " The love of democracy is a love of equality '' . 
canada is a democratic country , but democracy is as fragile as fine china , and the lawmakers have a duty to protect it . 
not only to protect it , but to improve it . 
by maintaining the present rules for political party funding and the appointment of returning officers , Bill C - 2 confirms our suspicions that the democratic discourse adopted by the government does not necessarily have as its corollary any love for equality . 
we greatly regret this , and in the words of Ch â teaubriand , a parliamentarian himself , we are forced to acknowledge that this bill does not meet our legitimate expectations and that , " despite the efforts of democracy to raise its standards with its grand goals , its standards are lowered by its actions '' . 
what a pity that the democratic habits of the Liberal Party will , instead of raising the standards of Canadian democracy , remorselessly lower those standards . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , it is a delight to have an opportunity to speak today to Bill C - 2 to amend the elections act . 
my presentation will be somewhat different from some of the others we have heard so far , which I must say have all been quite interesting . 
i will be very specific in my comments . 
i know it is a policy also in a number of other party sections , particularly the youth sections . 
i am referring in particular to section 3 of the elections act which states that every person who is a Canadian citizen and is 18 years of age or older on polling day is qualified as an elector . 
as we begin the 21 st century , we hear more and more from all political parties about the concern of young people . 
the way society and the economy are going there will be a future for them . 
the younger generation will be taking on major leadership roles very quickly and at very young ages . 
probably most MPs like myself spend a lot of time in high schools talking to young people . 
if there is one point that stands out clearly it is that young people today are very informed , very serious , and very hard working . 
we do not often hear about them . 
it becomes very clear that they are very well informed about political , economic and societal issues . 
when it comes to elections in some cases I am prepared to say that many of Canada ' s young people aged 16 or 17 are probably more informed than their parents on some issues . 
also it was suggested a few years ago that first nations people should have a chance to vote . 
today I am suggesting that young people aged 16 and 17 should be given the opportunity to participate in Canada ' s electoral process . 
section 215 of the criminal code says that everyone is under a legal duty as a parent , foster parent , guardian , or head of a family to provide the necessities of life for a child under the age of 16 years . 
at age 16 a whole number of things change for young people . 
at age 16 , for example , they can drive any kind of vehicle on our highways . 
they can join and serve in the armed forces of Canada . 
they are eligible for adult court consideration in our justice system . 
they can use a firearm and go hunting . 
they can leave school if that is their wish . 
they are no longer under their parents ' legal obligation to care for children . 
they have the legal right to get married and to raise children . 
they are not permitted to vote . 
they can go hunting , drive cars , get married and join the armed forces , but we do not permit young people who wish to vote the opportunity to cast their ballots in terms of the party of their choice and of the policies of their choice . 
after all , people who are aged 16 and 17 probably have the most to lose or gain by policies that parties and governments put forward compared to others in society . 
let us look at what happens in other jurisdictions that have given the vote to young people aged 16 and 17 . 
there are countries which for a number of years have said that they want our young people to participate in the electoral process , to get involved . 
we do it for a particular set . 
young people of 16 and 17 years of age are welcome to join a political party and choose the leader of that party . 
they are welcome to participate in enumeration during election time . 
they are welcome to participate and develop party policy for the New Democrats , the Reform Party , the Conservatives or the Liberals . 
they can choose leaders , develop policy and participate in the electoral process , but they cannot vote . 
there seems to be some inconsistency here , some slight hypocrisy in our positioning when we say we want to involve young people in their country ' s electoral process , we want them to participate but we will not let them vote on voting day . 
now there is a window of opportunity which we have not had for a long time as members of parliament . 
we can say to young people that not only do we want them to participate in the electoral process to determine the future of their country but we certainly want them to be able to cast a vote on election day by lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 . 
it would potentially add almost 700,000 young people to the voters list . 
they would not all want to vote , just as their parents do not all want to vote . 
a lot of adults do not vote today but the majority do . 
there are jurisdictions that have permitted young people to vote . 
a number of years ago Brazil said it wanted 16 and 17 year olds to participate in the electoral process . 
there were a lot of naysayers who said that they do not care about politics and they will not participate , blah , blah , blah , but the reality is quite the contrary . 
the participation rate of 16 and 17 year old voters in Brazil is higher than the average . 
in other words , given the opportunity to involve themselves in a meaningful way in their country ' s future , these young people rallied to the cause , as do young people in Nicaragua . 
they also have the opportunity to participate and vote at ages 16 and 17 . 
they are participating and showing interest in numbers beyond those of their parents . 
they know the situation . 
they have concerns . 
they would love to participate in the electoral process if we gave them that opportunity . 
from the limited information we have of those countries that permit this , not only do young people participate but they participate enthusiastically . 
my understanding is that the youth wings of all the political parties in the House have endorsed this concept , at least in principle or in detail . 
many of the provincial sections of our parties have adopted the idea of considering lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 . 
as we look through the various clauses of the elections act before us , clause 3 says a person has to be 18 . 
we all know about the technological revolution that has taken place in the last few years . 
now young people are plugged into the electronic world probably a whole lot more than we are . 
they understand the issues . 
they know how to get the information . 
those who wish to be are tuned in to the web pages of political parties . 
for those young men and women who are 16 and 17 years old , let us be bold as members of parliament as we approach the 21 st century and extend to them a welcoming hand . 
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood St. James - Assiniboia , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me first say that I find it particularly satisfying and exciting to begin the new session of parliament with the prime objective of improving our nation ' s democratic process . 
that consultation , conducted with the highest regard for the principles of parliamentary democracy , generated many suggestions and even allowed us to draw certain conclusions . 
the bill we are examining today is therefore not exclusively the creation of the government ; rather it reflects to a considerable extent the opinions of all parties present in the House . 
our electoral system has certainly made its mark throughout the world . 
new democracies are taking inspiration from it and using it as a model . 
true , this electoral system has evolved over the years and up to now has generally served the Canadian people well . 
but like anything else in the real world , an electoral system is never perfect . 
because the society it serves is constantly changing , our electoral system must not only keep pace with this evolution , but it should anticipate it to the greatest extent possible . 
when we come to think of it , an electoral system is never intended to respond to the limited needs of the day . 
on the contrary , an electoral system must anticipate tomorrow ' s democratic society and prepare for it . 
to achieve this objective , Canada has spared no effort . 
over the past few years there have been countless studies and reports . 
more recently , Canada ' s chief electoral officer , Jean Pierre Kingsley , submitted his own report following the 1997 election . 
in fact , our task is basically to improve a system that has made our democracy a source of pride and international recognition . 
we must correct a few imperfections , fill some gaps , update some components of the existing act to better reflect today ' s reality , but perhaps most important , adapt each measure to the requirements of the charter of rights and freedoms . 
to what extent should we accept this participation and what restrictions are to be imposed on spending ? 
those issues have already raised much controversy , including legal action . 
in this regard , the new bill provides for higher limits to allowable spending , $ 150,000 nationally and $ 3,000 per riding . 
in terms of administration , Bill C - 2 includes a series of new measures intended to facilitate many matters and here again to better respect Canadians ' rights and freedoms . 
the third important aspect of the bill concerns publication bans on both advertising and polls . 
this is another aspect of the act that has been contested before the courts . 
the elections act of 1974 banned all electoral advertising at the beginning of the campaign and before voting day . 
this was the situation until 1996 when the Alberta Court of Appeal rejected this principle in the Somerville case . 
as far as publicizing the result of polls is concerned , the ban applied for 72 hours before polling . 
last year however , the supreme court handed down a decision in the Thomson case declaring this to be inconsistent with the exercise of rights and freedoms . 
thus the court was saying that parliament ' s restrictions might be more acceptable if they included a requirement to make the polling methodology public along with the results of each poll . 
as a result , the government has opted for the best possible compromise in the new measures being put forward . 
first , all bans at the beginning of the electoral campaign are lifted . 
second , the bans before voting day are shortened from 72 hours to 48 hours . 
third , the bill requires that the publication of all public opinion polls during an election period include in the first 24 hours of publication , full details of the polling method applied . 
this decision first and foremost was intended to ensure fairness toward all voters . 
obviously some will cry censorship . 
they will argue that Canadian voters are perfectly capable of separating the wheat from the chaff and selecting the information that is meaningful to them . 
that may very well be . 
however the 48 hour period is a means of giving the voters a bit of a respite before they go to the polls , allowing time for personal and individual reflection without outside influence . 
i should note here that the supreme court in the Thomson decision did not take this reflection period into consideration . 
i believe this is a serious argument that brings the new measures entirely within the intent of the charter of rights and freedoms . 
as to polling methodology , its publication will enable people to get a better idea of whether the results are based on professional polling or amateur surveys . 
in closing , this electoral reform is yet another means of preserving what is most precious to all the people of Canada , our democracy . 
as we go about our day to day business we do not often have to think of it and when we do , we often see our democratic freedoms as an acquired right , perhaps even as our due . 
yet it takes only passing attention to international events of late unfortunately to remind us of the richness of our democracy . 
it is this richness that Bill C - 2 seeks to preserve . 
with Canada being a world leader in this area , there is no standard to follow . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , modernizing the Canada Elections Act is of the utmost importance to update a tool that is indispensable to the framing of our democracy . 
i think it is not going too far to say that , after 30 years , we must carefully look at every detail of this issue . 
it is a start . 
members of the House of Commons have done some preliminary work that is very important . 
but this bill is far from being perfect . 
in this exercise , it is essential to keep in mind that the work that has started and will continue over the next few weeks and the next few months will serve Canadian democracy and also each Canadian who must assume his or her responsibility to vote at specific intervals . 
it is important to consider certain elements which , to us , seem indispensable . 
this is a very laborious exercise . 
we are addressing issues on which it may be difficult to reach a consensus . 
the numerous clauses and hundreds of pages setting out the proposals to be submitted to the House at a later time force us to recognize that it is almost a monk ' s job that will be asked of parliamentarians . 
it will be hard to agree on everything . 
regarding the financing of political parties , for example , policy issues will arise that will need to be discussed . 
and these will be difficult issues . 
there is , for example , the issue of popular financing , which was introduced in Quebec . 
in spite of the fact that the act marked a huge improvement in the exercise of democratic rights , it is not perfect either . 
under the provincial act , a business or its members may still contribute to the financing of political parties . 
for example , in a law firm , only personal contributions are allowed . 
however , the firm itself could very well ask its members to contribute to a political party with the promise of being reimburse by the firm . 
a direct link between financing and democracy is not as easy as it may seem to make . 
these are nuances that will be important to address in debate or in committee . 
the selection of returning officers is also an issue that will have to be addressed . 
we need to put in place a system where returning officers at least appear to be beyond too direct political influence . 
in debate , it will be very interesting to hear suggestions from all political parties and all Canadians on how to improve this procedure . 
it will also be important to consider issues such as the voting age . 
it is becoming almost unavoidable to change the legal voting age given that , as one of my colleagues noted , young people are increasingly well - informed , and from an earlier age , about the problems and challenges they will have to face during their life . 
it will be important to consider changes in that respect . 
letting younger people take part in a democratic process , in an election , would probably force the vast majority of Canadians to be more attuned to the priorities that are of particular concern to young people . 
some of our debates , which have been going on for over 15 , 25 or 30 years , will have to be set aside , so that we can deal with issues that concern young people . 
in that context , we have to be open to the idea of lowering the voting age . 
to allow young people to vote at age sixteen might be appropriate . 
at that age , and even before , young people are increasingly aware of the issues confronting them . 
such a change might bring some fresh air to the Canadian democracy . 
let us not forget that these amendments to the Canada Elections Act concern all Canadian voters . 
that is why we may have to try to go as far as we can in seeking a consensus , so as to achieve near - unanimity in the House of Commons regarding this legislation . 
there will obviously be policy issues involved . 
each party has been adhering to certain principles for many years , even decades . 
in undertaking a review of such an important act , we should perhaps set aside the principles that have guided our actions in the past and be more forward - looking instead . 
this is important in order to give all Canadians an act that will reflect a great deal of openness regarding several issues , including financing . 
financing has always been a very divisive issue in Canada , where we have the strict public financing process as we know it in Quebec and the traditional financing system used elsewhere in the country . 
i think it is possible to reconcile the two and come to agree on financing methods that are acceptable to all Canadians , without contravening the principles of democracy . 
we raised the issues of polls , electronic information , Internet , etc. , and we will raise them again . 
it is important to limit such action rationally , because it is possible - democracy is important , we must protect it - to put it to demagogic use even . 
therefore , activity involving election polls and electronic information that will be distributed increasingly , both publicly and within our families , must be given a framework . 
i believe that the fact of having to publish the full rationality behind polls conducted will prevent , obviously , in the context of a regular election campaign , the publication of certain polls intended strictly to serve partisan purposes and to manipulate the very democratic action people are called on to take from time to time , namely vote in all good conscience . 
this is an important point that must be addressed . 
the fact that the number of hours in which the publication of polls both rational and less rational will be controlled is surely good news and will enable all Canadians to cast their vote in an objective and rational way that will benefit the country as a whole . 
i believe that our role as politicians is to do everything necessary to promote transparent democracy . 
among the various parties , everything must be done , in the context of the revision of election legislation , so that the periodic act of voting by the public may be governed by objective and non partisan rules . 
i am sure that all the time spent revising the Canadian election legislation will be beneficial for decades to come . 
i thank the House for having given me a few minutes to express my thoughts . 
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by expressing my support for the bill introduced by the government leader and reminding members that the new measures in this bill are the result of consultation by various parties over a period of several years . 
first , with respect to the time difference dilemma , we realized that the situation of Saskatchewan called for special attention . 
the minister has already covered this this morning . 
a special amendment in the bill also applies to the various aspects of publication during an electoral campaign . 
the problem of blackouts arises , not just with respect to advertising per se , but also with respect to the publication of opinion polls . 
the minister has set out the government ' s reasoning very clearly : in any democratic election , the electorate must have the final word , without any interference or influence . 
under the 1974 legislation , third parties claiming to have no political affiliation could intervene financially and however they wished in an election campaign . 
the solution thus led to a new problem . 
but there is public pressure on the government to do something about this . 
in this new bill , the government is therefore proposing that third party spending be capped at $ 150,000 nationally , and $ 3,000 per riding . 
still on the topic of funding , another factor called for immediate attention and that was inflation . 
by keeping its fiscal house in order , the present government has undoubtedly managed to minimize inflation ' s impact in recent years . 
nonetheless , since the 1974 legislation , the need for improvements at the electoral level has made itself felt . 
and this is another of the provisions in Bill C - 2 . 
as I indicated , the bill is a good step in the right direction . 
i am certain there will be other desirable measures in the not too distant future . 
i would like to put on record a suggestion that was made by a group of constituents in Davenport who some months ago suggested the establishment of a declined vote ballot paper . 
in other words , the option ought to be given to the elector to indicate that he or she declines to vote as a form of rejection , disapproval or malcontent with the candidates who are indicated on the ballot paper , none of whom meet the expectations of the elector . 
i look forward to the opportunity of explaining it in more detail at the appropriate moment . 
before concluding I will comment on the financing of election campaigns . 
election campaigns need not be as expensive as they are now . 
they can be run on much smaller budgets , with much less publicity at the national and local levels , with perhaps more debate and with particular discussions at the community level . 
there is no doubt we have a good system in place . 
in that respect I urge the government to give serious consideration to the elimination of contributions by sectoral interests such as the corporate sector and organized labour and trade unions and to increase the incentives for individual contributions . 
under that kind of system which exists in some jurisdictions the head of a corporation or union would make a personal contribution . 
in other words , the contribution would be on a personal basis rather than on the basis of a company or a union . 
the person would make that contribution out of the funds available to him or her as a private citizen and not as a contribution in the name of a corporation that may pursue specific interests in the legislation in the following parliament with a specific bill under certain conditions , or may use the threat of the withdrawal of contributions in future elections as a means of obtaining the attention and bending , so to say , the will of the government of the day . 
at the same time this would be coupled with the goal of eliminating corporate sector and organized labour contributions and any contribution by a specific narrow interest in society . 
one has to recognize that this is one of the issues that the government has already tackled in Bill C - 2 , by way of its amendments , which will deal with sectoral interests and specific interests with respect to publicity and intervention during an election period . 
we now need to build on this measure contained in Bill C - 2 and move toward a system that will allow for the flourishing of individual contributions and a gradual , if not determined , elimination of contributions from the corporate and organized labour sectors . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak in opposition to the government ' s scheme to torpedo Bill C - 2 through the House . 
this bill proposes changes to the Canada Elections Act . 
it is a very important bill for our democracy . 
as my colleagues , the hon. members for North Vancouver and Calgary West , have already pointed out , this bill was examined in committee during the first session of this parliament . 
yet , the contents of the bill being introduced today prove that the Liberals have ignored the witnesses who appeared before the committee . 
it is as if there had been no committee hearings at all with respect to this bill . 
normally bills before the House are sent to committee for study after the debate at second reading has taken place . 
this bill maintains the most objectionable provisions of the Canada Elections Act , especially those that benefit the ruling party , in this case the Liberal Party . 
our elections should be democratic , free and fair , offering equal opportunity to all candidates and all parties . 
Canadians have been asking for changes to the way we elect our federal government representatives . 
this week the Liberal government that lacks vision is being particularly undemocratic with Bill C - 2 . 
in the short time I have to speak on this bill I will say a few words about some of these areas . 
let us talk about patronage appointments . 
under the current elections act the system of patronage allows parties to appoint people to positions . 
this is a way of rewarding the party faithful , which has no place in our electoral system . 
it is outrageous in what is supposed to be a non - partisan , impartial and neutral electoral organization . 
elections Canada always recommends against a patronage ridden system when it helps developing nations set up their electoral system . 
yet , the Liberals are maintaining the system because it benefits them . 
they go out to preach what they do not practise at home . 
elections Canada has repeatedly asked the government to release it from the patronage system and allow it to hire its own staff for elections by advertising and interviewing based on ability , merit and experience . 
many Reform MPs have insisted in the past that these appointed positions be advertised in newspapers for staffing instead of filling these positions as patronage appointments . 
the chief electoral officer ' s report on the 36 th general election made the same recommendations as we have been proposing on this side of the House . 
opposition MPs on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs supported this position , but the Liberals opposed it , proving that the government ' s position is politically motivated in what should be a non - partisan situation . 
the third party spending limit is proposed to be $ 150,000 during a federal general election , of which no more than $ 3,000 may be spent on any particular riding . 
we believe that it is not the place of government to limit the rights of individual Canadians , or group of Canadians , to spend their money in support of a cause or a candidate in federal elections . 
far from levelling the playing field the Liberals are challenging the hallmarks of our democracy . 
for example , the ruling Liberal party has free broadcasting time based on the number of members of parliament it has , far and beyond what any other party is allowed to have . 
have the Liberals changed that situation with this bill ? 
this would give a huge advantage to the Liberals by restricting the ability of any other person or group to counter government propaganda during an election . 
let us talk about the requirements for registered party status . 
the elections act requires a political party to run 50 candidates in an election to remain a party on the ballot . 
the courts in Ontario say that only two candidates are needed to form a party . 
it is the voters , not the government , who should decide whether a party or a candidate is worthy of their vote . 
it is up to the voters , not the government . 
this is an attempt by the government to hinder the formation and growth of new parties like the Reform Party . 
the government is actually trying to limit competition on the ballot . 
it is undemocratic . 
it is anti - democratic . 
that is absolutely ridiculous . 
if someone is evil enough to try to commit fraud in an election , surely we can assume that the same person would have no problem swearing an oath , lying to God or to himself . 
regarding electronic voting , the Liberal government is ignoring the realities of the information age in denying us the use of electronic voting methods that are more efficient , less costly and more universally accessible voting systems . 
in Ontario electronic council elections can be run for one - sixth of the normal cost . 
let us talk about the reimbursement of a party ' s election expenses . 
the Liberals allow reimbursement of campaign expenses and then restrict eligibility for reimbursement to certain parties . 
what is going on here ? 
there should be no reimbursement at all to any candidate or any party . 
bill C - 2 retains the requirement for a candidate to deposit $ 1,000 . 
the candidate ' s deposit should be much lower , in the interest of encouraging Canadians to participate regardless of their financial position . 
in conclusion , there are many other areas where the bill could be criticized as undemocratic , including the lack of fixed dates for federal elections , the timing of byelections , government advertising or propaganda before an election , and others , but time prevents me from commenting on these matters . 
i would like to read an e - mail from one of my constituents . 
bill Lawton states : " All in all I feel this is just an affront to democracy . 
this bill is really draconian and not relevant to the democratic citizenry '' . 
it is nothing less than dictatorship , worse than even the military government in Pakistan . 
it is a crime in broad daylight . 
the government must amend Bill C - 2 and restore democracy in Canada . 
if this bill goes through in its present form Canadian voters should refuse to vote Liberal in the next election . 
Mr. Gar Knutson ( Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the government ' s introduction of a new elections act . 
let me begin my remarks today by congratulating Elections Canada for the work it has done in the past . 
i know that under the new bill it will continue to do fine work . 
i have been involved directly in two elections . 
i do not know if Elections Canada is monitoring this speech , but if it is I want to say how well I thought it did from my own personal experience . 
any Elections Canada official I had to deal with was extremely fair and I have had nothing but a good experience with the organization . 
elections Canada really is like a referee . 
we have the best election when we do not notice that it is there . 
it is like a sports game where we do not notice the calls that are being made by the referee . 
there is much work that Elections Canada does in getting ready for an election , such as voters lists and setting up the polls . 
it is a tribute to the hard work that there are not more complaints , given the complexity of the task of having people vote in a country as large as this . 
i will now turn to some substantive issues which have been addressed by members opposite . 
the opposition has raised the issue of the bill going to committee before second reading . 
i want to point out to members in the Chamber and to Canadians generally that by having the bill go to committee before second reading gives committee members greater latitude for a fuller , broader debate and to make different amendments than they would otherwise be able to make if the bill went to them after second reading . 
the basic principles of parliamentary procedure are that once a bill goes through second reading it has been approved in principle . 
amendments that can be made are somewhat more narrowly defined than would be allowed under parliamentary law , or more narrowly defined in that they cannot go against the bill which has already been approved in principle . 
by going to committee before second reading committee members can have a broader debate . 
they can look at numerous amendments in a broader context . 
being a member of that committee I look forward to having a very full and frank debate , which will impact on all of us elected to the House as well as Canadians everywhere . 
there are a number of administrative changes that are being proposed in the bill and there are reasons we need to make those changes . 
canada ' s electoral laws are based on principles we value as a democratic society : fairness , transparency and accessibility . 
they provide the framework of our electoral system . 
a House of Commons committee has concluded that Canada ' s electoral law remains strong , although a number of provisions came into effect nearly 30 years ago and should be updated . 
the proposed administrative changes are based on the committee ' s report . 
the first electoral administrative change I would like to talk about is the adjusting of voting hours . 
we will allow for the adjustment of voting hours for areas that do not switch to daylight savings time when other clocks move ahead one hour . 
i am sure we all remember a time when it used to be a grievance of western Canadians that as they turned on their televisions on election night there was a sense that the election had already been determined even before they had cast their votes because of the time zone switch . 
a government may have obtained a majority once the returns were made in Atlantic Canada , Quebec and Ontario . 
by the time the returns got to either the prairie provinces or British Columbia , the majority had already been set and there was a sense that their vote did not matter as much . 
all Canadians have a sense that their votes count just as much when the returns come in at roughly the same time . 
the act will also provide for standardized hours of voting for a single byelection or more than one byelection in the same time zone , being from 8.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. It will enable returning officers to vote . 
at present they may vote only in the case of a tie . 
it will authorize the electronic submission of nomination papers for all candidates to take account of the advent of new technologies . 
it will ensure the right of electors to post reasonable electoral signs and of candidates to canvas in multiple unit residential buildings , including condominiums , during campaigns . 
it will be good to have it spelled out more clearly in the Canada Elections Act that candidates actually have a right to go into apartment buildings during reasonable hours to canvas . 
the act will abolish the process of vouching to reduce the risks of electoral fraud , a practice whereby rural voters could vouch for neighbours at the polling place so that they would be allowed to vote even when they had not been enumerated . 
it will consolidate , clarify and modernize the language and organization of the act to make it easier to understand and apply . 
to offset the impact of inflation it will increase the threshold to $ 200 from the $ 100 level which was set in 1974 , the 75 % threshold for the political tax credit . 
all of us as politicians who have to raise money understand what this means , but the general public may not . 
the issue of what level the threshold should be , whether $ 100 or $ 200 , is somewhat academic . 
the main point is that it is an example of something that makes our system fair . 
if one wants to donate to a political party , whether one ' s name is Gerry Schwartz or some other name it becomes a matter of public record . 
this is one of the key elements of our electoral law that prevents corruption in our system . 
someone may want to try to influence me by making a donation to my party or to my campaign . 
however , if it has to be public there is a record . 
the opposition can obtain that record and raise the issue in the House . 
the local media can obtain it . 
this is one thing that limits the influence of big money . 
in Canada we have a system of which we can be particularly proud , particularly in comparison with the system in the United States where the accusation is often made quite rightly that its politics are driven by big money . 
the amount of money that a congressman or senator has to raise to run for re - election in its federal system is somewhat scandalous . 
under the new act we will require a more detailed financial reporting by registered parties . 
it is the same issue of making sure that parties conduct their business in a transparent way . 
if a party is receiving money from individuals , they are registered and become public . 
it will also let us know what money is being spent on . 
during a campaign there are limits on what someone can spend . 
it should be open and transparent reporting so that we can see whether someone is trying to sneak around the campaign limits by spending money ahead of the campaign . 
proper reporting is one of the cornerstones or the guardians of making sure that people do not overspend their limits . 
the new act will also prohibit the transfer of surplus funds from a party or local association to a candidate after polling day . 
all this does is prevent someone from trying to run to raise money for their own personal benefit . 
i am happy the government is proceeding with the bill . 
as a member of the committee I look forward to debating with the opposition the merits of the bill and any amendments that will come forward from all members of the House . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to be able to rise in this short debate today . 
as you know , Mr. Speaker , but perhaps not everyone within hearing distance of the debate knows , we are indirectly talking about Bill C - 2 . 
the motion before the House right now is whether or not we should send the bill to committee prior to second reading . 
i have had some experience with this matter . 
i will use the first couple of minutes of my time to address what we are really supposed to be addressing today , whether or not the bill should go to committee at this time . 
hopefully we would come forward with a bill with less controversial wording and less in need of amendment . 
the whole idea sounded like a really good one . 
that is really a strong statement but it really is so , unfortunately . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
i wish members opposite would listen to what I am saying . 
i know they have a duty to protect their political party and the government of the day . 
it is a sham in this sense . 
it is known that the Liberals as the governing party dominate every committee . 
for the Liberals to have eight members and all of the opposition parties together to have seven is I suppose okay , but unfortunately government members lose their freedom in committee as they do the House . 
just as we have had members of the Liberal Party stand with tears in their eyes to vote against something they were deeply in favour of , so we have those members in committees controlled by the leader of the government or the minister , as the case may be . 
i have firsthand experience in this regard . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
i know members are enthusiastic in their support of what he has to say or against it as the case may be , but it is nice to be able to hear the words of wisdom of the hon. member for Elk Island . 
i am sure all hon. members would like to do that . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
Mr. Speaker , I really wish they would give thoughtful attention to what I am trying to say . 
as defenders of democracy , as they like to call themselves , they should also be speaking the same words I am now speaking . 
it was one of the first bills that went to committee before second reading . 
i was involved in the debate . 
i thought it would be great and I put forward an idea . 
a clear majority of members , including those on the government side , were in favour of the amendment I proposed . 
it is a stifling of freedom of speech in the House of Commons . 
i proceeded with the amendment to the wording of the bill and assumed that it would be accepted . 
i thought you agreed with the common sense of what I was trying to propose '' . 
the Liberal member to whom I spoke looked at me , shrugged his shoulders and said " We really don ' t have a choice '' . 
i put forward that evidence to say that the whole process is a sham . 
even though the committee will do the work , and I have no doubt that it will try to do good work , the ultimate control will come from the government House leader in that committee . 
he will basically dictate what the final results of the bill will be . 
it is surely unfortunate that I do not have a couple of hours to debate everything . 
i will have to hurry . 
i will now talk a little about the bill . 
my colleague has already mentioned the magnitude of Bill C - 2 . 
it is a huge bill . 
it has 250 - some pages . 
there is a lot of detail in terms of prescribing how we conduct our elections . 
the index alone has xxii pages , and I will talk about two of them . 
according to the government House leader who made a speech this morning , one of the topics covered is improving the way our elections work and of improving democracy in Canada . 
i want to talk about clause 39 . 
it is important to actually put on the record what it says . 
i cannot read them all but they all have this wording : 
then it says that the candidates shall be appointed as much as possible half from the candidate ' s party that finished first and half from the candidate ' s party that finished second . 
is not Elections Canada and the work of Elections Canada impartial ? 
is that not what democracy is ? 
we have right in the elections act proposed by the government an entrenchment of a practice which has been in our procedures for far too long . 
there is a pay off if one votes correctly . 
the Prime Minister will tell people in his riding to vote for him and he will be able to funnel millions of taxpayers dollars into the riding . 
that will be their prize for voting for him . 
i was surprised when I was first elected to find out that this process existed . 
in fact I was a brand new candidate back in 1993 . 
i had never participated in elections before and one day I got a phone call telling me that the Reform Party came second in the 1988 election and that I now had the right to name all the deputy returning officers in the polls . 
i said , " That cannot be , Elections Canada is surely impartial . 
just because we came second surely does not give me the right to now say that the people who voted for the Reform Party in the last election will now get a payoff , a government job '' . 
i declined . 
i told the returning officer in Elk Island to choose the person who did it the last time if she or he did a good job . 
i also said that I did not care what party the person was with , but that if there was somebody who worked last time and did not do a good job that I would give my permission to fire them . 
i should have been out of the loop . 
the principled Reform Party , not the one of political expedience doing anything that needs to be done to get elected but rather the one that is based on principle , says that the Reform Party supports giving Elections Canada the power to select and hire all of its own employees , including but not limited to returning officers , deputy returning officers and other field staff . 
we believe that the decision should be made on merit and on ability to do the job and not based on a debt to be paid because of having shown favour to one political party or another . 
if I had time I would also love to talk about many other issues in Bill C - 2 but of course with this process we cannot . 
i have only these few minutes and members cannot even ask me any questions . 
that is regrettable , I am sure . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
my colleague spoke so eloquently that I wonder if the House would agree to allow him another 10 minutes . 
it was such a great speech , I would like to hear more . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent to extend the hon. member for Elk Island ' s time by an additional 10 minutes ? 
an hon. member : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted to speak to Bill C - 2 . 
i was particularly interested in the analysis and comments by the previous speaker with regard to the work of committees . 
in the last two years I have served on the public accounts committee which is chaired by one of the Reform opposition members who , I would add , does a very good job , is very impartial and fair and really runs an excellent committee . 
we have a process in place here where the official opposition automatically gets the opportunity , if it so chooses , to chair the public accounts committee . 
i also served on the citizenship and immigration committee and filled in on a number of different committees . 
the committee system that is in place is not dysfunctional and is not what the member has said , a sham . 
in fact , it is representative of the make - up of this place . 
why would that be ? 
interestingly enough , the majority of Canadians voted for this government in two elections in a row . 
should we abdicate our responsibility ? 
we have been told by the Canadian people that they want the Liberal Party and this Prime Minister to run the government . 
we understand that the opposition is not happy with that . 
i served in opposition myself to a labour party , to Bob Rae and - I will be nice - his group of colleagues . 
it was somewhat frustrating , to say the least , to see a majority government of New Democrats in the great province of Ontario . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad : 
Mr. Speaker , it appears to me there are not very many members to hear the speech of the member opposite . 
i ask that quorum be checked . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i see a quorum . 
the hon. member for Mississauga West has the floor . 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
Mr. Speaker , it is not my fault if the room empties when I stand up to speak . 
i try to do my best . 
i do appreciate the assistance to bring in some of my colleagues whom I know are working hard at their desks on behalf of the people of Canada and their constituents . 
even though the official committees are not up and running yet , although I understand they will be in a day or two , we , in particular , have caucus committees . 
last evening I had the privilege of having dinner with the parliamentary group from Barbados who are here on official business and will be here for question period . 
there is a lot of work to do . 
i recently attended a meeting of AECL where it gave us an update of its work around the world . 
to denigrate the work of members really is not fair . 
it is not something that I would do on that side of the House and would not expect it to be done here . 
i would say that the committee system is very clear in this government . 
in this place , in Ottawa , there is a role for opposition members . 
sometimes I am quite surprised , actually . 
were I in opposition , I think I would be substantially more aggressive in going after - 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
or effective ? 
Mr. Steve Mahoney : 
i certainly would find more opportunities to raise issues . 
i do not see that . 
i put a proposal forward back in the Ontario legislature in 1992 . 
in fact , I stood for the leadership of our party . 
this is about as close as I have seen any government get to that particular principle . 
this is taking the bill reforming the Elections Act into committee before second reading . 
if I were in opposition I would have my staff working overtime going through the bill . 
i would see this as an open and accountable government giving opposition members the opportunity to make comments at committee , to repair anything they thought needed repairing , to change parts of the bill and to have input into the process . 
what do we get ? 
we get , I am afraid , the somewhat typical response , " If they are doing it , we must disagree with it '' . 
that really is unfortunate . 
it is somewhat myopic and narrow - minded . 
it does not do credit to the constituents who sent these people here , who expect them to roll up their sleeves and get into committee and work with government members and other members of the opposition to make this bill a better bill . 
why would anyone opposed it ? 
my next election will be my tenth at the municipal , provincial and federal levels . 
i have had some experience . 
i guess one could say we are a bit of a political family . 
we care about the process that is in place . 
we care about the rules . 
i , along with my family and the government , believe very much that the rules need to be fair for everyone . 
i believe there should be a penalty for someone who does not vote . 
i know it is a very controversial idea , but there are places in the world where they actually do that . 
the penalty in Australia is a fine . 
it could show up on one ' s income tax reporting . 
they just do not accept the responsibility to cast a ballet . 
in the 1995 Ontario provincial election I think there was a higher voter turnout because the public generally wanted to dismiss the government of Mr. Rae that was in office . 
however , we have now slipped back down again . 
federally , it again increases into the 65 % to 75 % range . 
we live in a country with democratic freedom and we see other places in the world experiencing difficulties , in particular , the problems we see in Pakistan today . 
i had the privilege of being part of a parliamentary group visiting Croatia during the first free election since the second world war . 
i saw men and women lining up down the street , with tears in their eyes , having the first opportunity to actually cast a ballot . 
let me tell members what that experience was like . 
when I walked into the polling booth there were Yugoslav soldiers with rifles on their shoulders standing on either side of the ballot box . 
behind the ballot box was a life - sized picture of General Tito . 
it was only just a little bit intimidating to those people casting their ballot . 
i tried to lighten it up by pinning Canadian flags on the lapels of the soldiers but I do not think they were particularly amused by it . 
when one sees that kind of thing , when one sees people fighting and dying for freedom and democracy all around the world as we have seen in our generation , one realizes that a Canadian who does not cast a ballot unless there is a legitimate reason , although I cannot think of one other than being dead , is not living up to the responsibility that goes along with the freedom of living in such a great and democratic society . 
i would go even further , but the bill at least sets a level playing field , makes it fair for everybody involved and cleans up the election procedure in Canada . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
for well over 30 years , it has not been revised significantly , and the chief electoral officer was striving to have it amended significantly . 
it has hardly been mentioned . 
Mr. Lacoursi è re himself told me some time ago that the Canada Elections Act was very difficult to consult and to understand . 
this is not normal . 
therefore , it is important to call a spade a spade . 
it is important for the thousands of people who have to work with the Canada Elections Act at some point to be able to find whatever they are looking for quickly and efficiently instead of always feeling lost in the legalese used by government lawyers - we hope they themselves can find their way through it . 
the problems raised by Mr. Lacoursi è re dealt with issues that will undoubtedly be raised again , issues like voting by mail , a process that is riddled with flaws , and voting at mobile polling stations , a process that will certainly have to be refined . 
in my speech , I will touch on three main elements of this bill on which we are criticizing the government . 
first , there is political party financing , which is not a new issue but which deserves to be raised again because of the scandalous way in which political parties are managed and because of the connections that exist between large corporations and the election funds of traditional political parties in Canada . 
second , we want to address the designation of returning officers . 
third , we want to talk about voter identification , something that leaves a lot to be desired and , here again , we can give some examples from Quebec . 
we know full well that the legislation is full of holes that allow corporations as well as individuals to shamelessly contribute all they want to Canada ' s traditional political parties . 
issues like the Onex proposal , which I feel , as a Quebecer , goes against the best interests of Quebec and maybe even of all of Canada and which , notwithstanding its basic flaws , demonstrates the more or less honourable relationship between the Liberal Party of Canada and the main promoter of the Onex deal , can only further undermine the proposal . 
we feel this entitles us to criticize this proposal all we want . 
its credibility is open to question , given the known relationship between one of the major contributors to the Liberal Party , former Cabinet members and current party managers . 
the federal government blithely announced that there will be a moratorium , as if it were one of its own management decisions . 
obviously , it is part of the Onex agenda to get the federal government involved at some point by taking such a measure to help the deal along . 
the Canadian government obviously committed itself in favour of Onex , for reasons that may too shameful to mention because they are related to the financing of the party currently in office . 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel : 
it is true . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
this is shameful , because it is primitive . 
so - called civilized societies such as ours should ensure that rules are in place to protect government decision makers from undue influence . 
this is what democratic financing is all about . 
this is what we realized in Quebec . 
we set a limit of $ 3,000 for contributions made to political parties , and such contributions can only be made by voters . 
all these businesses contribute tens of thousands of dollars and , in return , get privileged access to the ministers and the Prime Minister . 
it is all a matter of cause and effect . 
when the financing process is flawed , it is not possible to look after the public ' s interest only . 
nowadays , governing is complicated enough in itself . 
therefore , it is a good thing that the Quebec government does not have to concern itself with private interests . 
this is the strength of the Quebec government , given the complexities involved . 
it is free to act . 
it only needs to do so intelligently , whereas the federal government must accommodate all kinds of phantoms who remain nameless . 
my second major criticism has to do with the appointment process for returning officers . 
this is issue is not as well known . 
it is even better if one has been the president or vice - president of an association , and better yet a defeated candidate . 
this is unacceptable , and primitive . 
it smacks of the way things are done in a banana republic . 
canada is one of the western democracies that go around preaching to the whole world on how things should be done . 
we travel all over the planet to tell people how to govern themselves , and yet to this very day we still tolerate having as one of the main , yet hidden , criteria for appointment active membership in the Liberal Party of Canada . 
to top it all off , the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada saw how incongruous and unacceptable the situation was , and has long been recommending that the Canadian government change the rules so that , like Quebec , there would be a competition to designate elections staff , as indeed there should be . 
finally - and I shall close with this - the last weakness is that there is not a word about voters being required to identify themselves with a card or some other means . 
given the impersonal character of our society and our big cities , it is completely normal for citizens to be required to identify themselves to the person at the polling station , since we know all the funny business there can be . 
it is in within the order of things for voters to be required to identify themselves to whoever is duly mandated to require it before giving them authorization to vote , a fundamental right in a democracy . 
yet again , this is a considerable weakness in the bill and one against which we must speak out . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to enter this debate today with respect to the Canada Elections Act . 
i find it of considerable interest . 
we in Canada have a model electoral system that is emulated around the world . 
it is certainly considered to be one that is of great interest to nations wherever they are in the world . 
it also underscores the values , institutions and symbols that unite us as a people and present us as an effective nation not only to ourselves internally but to the wider world community . 
i am a little surprised by the Reform Party , especially the member for Elk Island who tried to denigrate the things we are trying to do . 
that is most unfortunate . 
but then Reform is a party that is always intent on pitting region against region , people against people and group against group . 
it is most unfortunate that Reformers take that tact all the time . 
it underscores where that party is coming from . 
i know Canadians want and will have no part of it . 
what Canadians will have a part of is the government ' s position on this all important legislation , understanding that this is the way we have to go . 
we need to ensure that we do the right thing for Canadians in this area because it underscores our democratic system as we know it . 
there are many issues I could get involved with , election financing for example . 
i know - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry but it is my duty to interrupt the hon. member and the proceedings at this time and put forthwith the question on the motion now before the House . 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
in my opinion the yeas have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the chief government whip on a point of order . 
Mr. Bob Kilger : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
discussions have taken place between all the party whips . 
pursuant to Standing Order 45 I believe you would find consent to defer the recorded division just requested on Bill C - 2 until later this day at the end of the time provided for government orders . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there consent to defer the division to 6.30 p.m. as agreed to by all the whips ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i will call it again if need be but I believe five members rose and I am prepared to defer it . 
therefore the vote is deferred until 6.30 p.m.

personal INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
the House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C - 6 , an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee . 
speaker ' S RULING 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the notice paper contains 157 motions in amendment with respect to report stage of Bill C - 6 . 
the motions will be grouped for debate as follows . 
group No. 2 , Motions Nos. 3 , 4 , 6 to 8 , 11 to 26 , 34 , 35 , 44 to 46 , 50 and 51 . 
the voting order for each group is available from the clerk . 
the Chair will repeat this order for the House as each vote is taken . 
members are of course aware that the notice paper contains many motions at report stage with respect to Bill C - 6 . 
motions Nos. 100 to 155 are of concern to the Chair because they depart from usual House practice . 
these motions would drop all clauses in schedule 1 . 
normally , a single motion would suffice . 
i have decided to allow these motions at this time . 
however , in the future only one motion will be accepted . 
i have so instructed the clerks in Journals . 
they will advise members wishing to place such motions on notice that these would not be accepted . 
i will now put Motions Nos. 1 , 2 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 27 to 33 , 36 to 43 , 47 to 49 , 57 , 59 to 97 , and 100 to 157 to the House . 
Mr. Pierre Brien : 
did I understand correctly that for this one time only you will allow Motions Nos. 100 to 157 to stand individually but that in the future you want them in a single group , which in any case does not alter the present situation since these motions are all in Group No. 1 , which will be debated starting today ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member is absolutely right . 
today , we will study all of the motions before the House , as the member indicated . 
i said that in the future we will permit one motion only instead of several .

that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Schedule 3 . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i should inform the House that after that 20 minute speech debates are limited to 10 minutes . 
Mr. Pierre Brien : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to speak to the first group of amendments to Bill C - 6 , formerly Bill C - 54 , an act to support electronic commerce and protect personal information . 
i will start by saying that we have many problems with this bill for several reasons . 
this explains why we are proposing so many amendments asking for the withdrawal of the bill or , at the very least , the suspension of its implementation in Quebec . 
when we deal with the second group of amendments , we will have an opportunity to discuss more specifically one particular amendment that would make this possible , should the government have the will to do so . 
the purpose of the bill is , in a rapidly evolving technological context , to foster the development of electronic commerce while respecting the confidentiality of the information we supply or agree to supply , or the use that could be made of personal information provided without knowing how it is going to be used . 
it should be noted that , for the past five years already , Quebec has had a law protecting personal information . 
the introduction or implementation of a federal act will create administrative chaos , making life very difficult for businesses . 
one can understand the will displayed by the federal government in this respect . 
in the other nine provinces , there is no law protecting personal information . 
therefore the federal government has decided to go ahead and legislate . 
too bad for the other provinces if they do not want their own law and are willing to withdraw from a field of jurisdiction that could be theirs . 
this is not the case in Quebec . 
Quebec businesses have to abide by the civil code provisions as well as the law . 
this is why many groups appeared before the Committee during the hearings and told the government " You are placing Quebec in a very bad position , when we already have a provincial act that protects both privacy and access to information . 
with this new act , businesses will not always know which act to enforce and which definition to use in specific cases . 
some organizations will have to abide by the federal act , others by the provincial act and others yet by both or part of one and part of the other '' . 
of course , the government will say " Listen , this will only take effect in three years because , in the first three years , the new act will not apply to all fields , data or businesses '' . 
but , in three years , it will get much more extensive and will apply to everybody . 
the Cabinet could make an order to withhold a particular field of activities or ensure that some sectors get under another act . 
but this will have to be decided by the federal government after careful consideration of its objectives and criteria . 
i can quote a number of people who addressed this issue at the committee ' s hearings . 
i will start with the Conseil du patronat du Qu é bec , which came to say " Inasmuch as the constitutional jurisdiction over the protection of privacy and personal information given to the provinces by section 92.13 of the British North America Act , it is obvious that the legislator " 
the Speaker : 
i am sorry to have to interrupt , but since you still have six minutes to go , I thought it would be best to do so at this point . 
i am going to table a report , and then we will proceed to Statements by Members . 
you will have the floor again after Oral Questions .

privacy COMMISSIONER 
the Speaker : 
i have the honour to lay upon the table the 1998 - 1999 report of the Privacy Commissioner . 
this report is deemed permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate my constituent Alexina Louie on receiving the Jules Leger prize for new chamber music for her award winning work , " Nightfall '' , a piece for 14 solo strings . 
established in 1978 , this prize is a national award designed to encourage Canadian composers to write for chamber music groups and to foster the performance of Canadian chamber music . 
this is the only governor general ' s award given for music , and Alexina is the first woman to receive it . 
Alexina Louie ' s work has received both national and international acclaim and recognition . 
Ms. Louie has previously been named composer of the year and received a Juno award and a Chalmers award for her compositions . 
Ms. Louis has also received the Socan award for being the most frequently performed Canadian composer . 
as a composer in residence with the Canadian Opera Company she is currently working on a main stage opera which is to be performed in the fall of 2000 . 
i say congratulations to Alexina .

organ DONATIONS 
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government just released its response to the organ donor crisis in our country . 
what an enormous disappointment it was . 
with 150 Canadians dying every year waiting for a transplant and with one of the worst donor rates in the entire developed world , it took the government four months to respond , during which time 66 Canadians died . 
the government ' s solution to this crisis is to ponder it , study it and examine it , despite the fact that there is a 13 point federal - provincial agreement and despite the fact that the health committee put forth an exhaustive , doable plan to save Canadian lives . 
why was there no commitment to have a national registry for potential donors and recipients ? 
why was there no commitment to train and identify organ donor co - ordinators ? 
why was there no commitment to have a national effort to put an organ donor card on every single patient ' s chart in our country ? 
if this government cannot resolve the organ donor crisis which is really a motherhood issue , what hope is there that it will have a chance to resolve the more complex health care challenges ?

women ' S COLLEGE HOSPITAL 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 12 , 1999 , I was honoured to be asked on behalf of the Minister of Canadian Heritage to unveil a historic sites and monuments plaque commemorating the importance of Women ' s College Hospital in providing medical services for women by women . 
women ' s College Hospital has always played a vital role in the community . 
today ' s commemoration is a deserved recognition of the hospital ' s contribution to the women ' s movement , to the community , and to medicine . 
the plaque reads : 
women ' s College Hospital has earned a distinctive place in Canadian medical history . 
from its beginnings as a small outpatient clinic in 1898 to its development as a modern teaching hospital , the institution symbolizes the struggle of women to claim their place in the medical profession . 
it offered them opportunities in teaching and in hospital practice , which were often unavailable or extremely limited elsewhere in the country . 
the hospital has made innovative contribution to the treatment and diagnosis of disease through its vital focus on health issues affecting women and families . 
i would also like to thank Lindalee Tracy for the film Passing the Flame : 
the Legacy of Women ' s College Hospital .

international NETWORK ON CULTURAL POLICY 
Mr. Mauril B é langer ( Ottawa - Vanier , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in June 1998 , Canada hosted the first international meeting of national ministers responsible for culture . 
at that time , the international network on cultural policy was created . 
after a year of existence , the Network has a membership of some forty representatives from a wide diversity of countries , such as France , the United Kingdom , Sweden , South Africa , Italy , Senegal , Barbados , Mexico and the Philippines . 
the second informal meeting of the international network on cultural policy was held last month in Oaxaca , Mexico . 
the purpose of this meeting was to ensure the viability of the network as a dynamic international forum for issues related to cultural policy . 
the ministers of culture of Quebec and Newfoundland were members of the Canadian delegation to Oaxaca , and their presence enriched our participation , as well as the discussions in general . 
canada is pleased to provide the network with a permanent liaison office which will follow up on the Bureau ' s activities . 
* * * 
grain TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool has a near monopoly on grain buying on the Altawan and Notukeu rail subdivisions in my riding . 
because the pool is able through zone allocation and car flexing to use its grain car entitlements elsewhere , the elevators on that line have been plugged for more than two weeks . 
the railway company will not deliver cars to the few competing elevators or to producers who wish to load their own grain because the competition alone cannot assemble a 50 car train . 
farmers in the area are therefore forced to haul grain as much as 80 kilometres over substandard roads while their local elevators are idle . 
i am not suggesting that the pool and the railway company collude , but they do share a common interest in limiting the amount of grain shipped off of that line . 
as less grain is shipped , the line becomes less viable and line abandonment becomes more easy to justify . 
as usual , the interests of farmers are being subordinated to those of the grain companies and the railways . 
* * * 
ROBERT MUNDELL 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Robert Mundell , a professor at Columbia University , has been awarded the Nobel prize in economy . 
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has recognized the work of this Canadian economist , a pioneer of the European monetary union , barely a few months after the introduction of the Euro . 
in the early sixties , Professor Mundell did a great deal of research on monetary and economic union , at a time when no one dared question the use of national currencies . 
the academy said that " Robert Mundell displayed remarkable and quasi - prophetic anticipation regarding the future problems of international monetary arrangements and financial markets '' . 
it is unfortunate that the Liberal government refuses to listen to this great economist and will not do like the Bloc Quebecois and seriously consider a North American monetary union . 
one of the best ways to prepare for the future is to build it , not wait around passively , like this government is doing on an issue that comes under its jurisdiction .

ENDICOTT PEABODY HUMANITARIAN AWARD 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Halton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my honour and privilege to congratulate our Minister of Foreign Affairs , the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre , on being named the winner of the inaugural Endicott Peabody humanitarian award for his lead role in helping to rid the world of anti - personnel land mines . 
our minister will receive the award on Friday from the United Nations Association of Greater Boston . 
a former governor of Massachusetts and vice - president of the Boston UN association , Mr. Peabody spent his retirement years working for a variety of peace groups that focused on land mines . 
the treaty banning anti - personnel land mines became law on March 1 , 1999 . It has been signed by 135 countries and ratified by 86 . 
this is not the first time our minister has been recognized for his work on land mines . 
he was also honoured last October when he was awarded the Council of Europe ' s North South peace prize . 
congratulations . 
* * * 
trucking INDUSTRY 
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure today to bring to the attention of the House that many of the key representatives of Canada ' s trucking industry are with us in Ottawa today . 
it is important to remember that trade is one of the engines of economic growth for Canada . 
with a relatively small population spread thinly over a vast distance , Canada does not have the luxury of neglecting transportation and trade . 
in my riding of Etobicoke North we are close to the Pearson airport and the 400 highways . 
we know very well why the trucking industry is so vital to Ontario ' s economy . 
total commercial trucking accounts for approximately 400,000 jobs . 
i am pleased to see the trucking and railway industries working together to ensure an efficient and safe transportation system that will continue to benefit local and national businesses and , in turn , keep our economy strong . 
that is why we must work closely with Canada ' s trucking industry to ensure that we have an environmentally sound and sustainable transportation system into the next millennium . 
working together , Canada ' s trucking industry keeps Canada rolling . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to criticize the government on the current crisis in western agriculture . 
the farmers in my riding of Dauphin - Swan River and across the prairies face bankruptcy because of the government ' s lack of real solutions . 
today the government continues to neglect the farm disaster taking place in western Canada . 
farming , an important sector of the Canadian economy , is under attack . 
last week farmers from Saskatchewan and Manitoba came to Ottawa to say enough is enough . 
during the summer they tried peaceful demonstrations to bring attention to their plight . 
in light of the recent controversy surrounding the fisheries of Atlantic Canada , the government has pleaded for peaceful negotiations . 
the farm community is pleading for help . 
i ask the House to support my call in asking the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food to do the right thing . 
western farmers need help and they need it now . 
* * * 
fight AGAINST POVERTY 
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos ( Ahuntsic , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October 17 was International Day for the Eradication of Poverty . 
unfortunately , in Canada , a large number of people are still living in poverty . 
i want to mention the extraordinary work done by community groups in the riding of Ahuntsic , including Solidarit é Ahuntsic , for which I act as spokesperson in the fight against poverty , the Carrefour d ' aide aux nouveaux arrivants , which organized a seminar on poverty on Thursday , the SNAC and the Corbeille Bordeaux - Cartierville , with which I organize a non - perishable food drive at Christmas . 
our government in the past and with the recent Speech from the Throne has taken positive steps toward assisting Canadian families living in poverty , and most important , children , with programs such as the national head start program , the new national child benefit and the Canada child tax benefit program . 
but together we must do more . 
we owe it to future generations to ensure that none of our children go hungry , or have no shelter , or grow up poor . 
* * * 
the LATE FERNAND DUB É 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , all New Brunswickers were saddened at the recent passing of the hon. Fern Dub é . 
first elected to the New Brunswick legislature in 1974 , he served his province for 13 years as Minister of Tourism and the Environment , Finance and Energy , then as Attorney General and Minister of Justice , and finally as Minister of Commerce and Technology . 
he was especially instrumental in building understanding between French and English speaking New Brunswickers . 
those of us who knew Fern will always remember him as a true gentleman . 
Fern never lost touch with the grassroots people . 
at the time of his passing he was still serving them as mayor of his beloved city of Campbellton , New Brunswick . 
Fern is survived by his wife Monique , his daughters France and Anik , and his sons Pierre and Jean , our colleague the hon. member for Madawaska - Restigouche . 
i am sure I speak for all members of the House when I say that our sympathies go out to the Fern Dub é family . 
* * * 
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois I congratulate Robert Rabinovitch on his appointment as the president of the CBC . 
M. Rabinovitch certainly has the qualities and the abilities needed to carry out his new duties honourably . 
he will , however , face a major challenge , that of ensuring the independence of the CBC , on which the public places its trust , justifying the allocation of public funds . 
the corporation ' s independence is threatened by the desire of Canadian Heritage to use the CBC to serve the political ends of its government . 
recognized for his determination to have a free hand in performing his duties , Mr. Rabinovitch , we hope , will feel freed of the old Trudeau demons , who wanted the CBC to be an instrument of Canadian unity . 
* * * 
national PARKS 
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 10 years ago the government pledged to complete the national parks system by the year 2000 . 
to date , only four of the promised 15 national parks have been created . 
two years ago Parks Canada reported that only one park is not under pressure . 
the other 38 are threatened by logging , mining , road construction , hydroelectric and tourism developments . 
the Speech from the Throne makes a very positive reference to national parks . 
i congratulate and urge the government to provide legal protection to all national parks , complete the national parks system and implement the recommendations of the G é rin report . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past weekend the minister of agriculture hosted the Funfest on the Farm , a celebration of the Canadian farmer . 
each of my colleagues in the House received an invitation in a glossy package of materials delivered by the minister . 
if this is the minister ' s response to our farm crisis that almost every Canadian , except those in government , seems to be aware of , then all hope is lost for our farm communities . 
i personally challenge the minister of agriculture to hand deliver his pretty little calendar to a farm family who will literally earn less than nothing this year . 
for the western farmer about to lose the land that has been in his family for generations , there is no funfest on his farm . 
since June the minister has repeatedly said the AIDA program is almost complete . 
i realize the farming community only represents 3 % of Canadians , but let us hope that they receive some assistance before next October ' s Funfest on the Farm . 
* * * 
week WITHOUT VIOLENCE 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is the fourth annual YWCA Week Without Violence . 
this week has become a major national tool in our efforts to make Canada a less violent society . 
each year it gives us an opportunity to think about the impact of violence on us all . 
one of the focuses this year in Peterborough and across Canada is youth . 
the idea is to involve young people and encourage them to think about the richness and joy of a non - violent lifestyle . 
i encourage all members and all Canadians to contribute to the YWCA ' s Week Without Violence .

member FOR DARTMOUTH 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with immense pleasure that I inform our colleagues in the House that today the NDP member of parliament for Dartmouth becomes the first sitting member of parliament ever nominated for a Governor General ' s literary award . 
nominated in English drama for her play Corker , the member for Dartmouth blends her passion as a parliamentarian with her artistry as a playwright to create a powerful drama about the importance of supporting families and building communities which value and celebrate the contributions of all . 
i ask everyone to join in extending our congratulations to our artist in the House , our playwright parliamentarian , our beloved member for Dartmouth . 
[ editor ' s Note : 
members rose and applauded ] 
the Speaker : 
it is not often that we have one of our own recognized in such a fashion . 
for this day , of course , you can have a prop in the House . 
on behalf of your colleagues , Wendy , I wish you well and thank you for what you do for our House by being such a great artist and a good parliamentarian . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
airline INDUSTRY 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , just hours ago Air Canada and its partners announced their proposal for reorganizing the airline industry . 
Onex and Canadian Airlines announced their proposal a number of weeks ago . 
we now know where both the airlines stand but we still have not heard from the government . 
the government did not even mention this subject in the Speech from the Throne . 
now that everyone else has abandoned the status quo , will the Prime Minister tell us what he envisions for the Canadian airline industry of the 21 st century ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as was said , some offers were made today by Air Canada , as there was an offer made by Onex to the shareholders of the company . 
its shareholders will look at what is best for them and they will decide . 
the Minister of Transport enunciated very clearly the five conditions that the government is demanding under the circumstances , but we have to know the results of the bidding before we carry on with our policy of making sure that we have at least one national airline in Canada . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is standing still while everything else in the airline industry is moving . 
surely the government has an obligation to be more specific about a policy framework for the airline industry . 
for example , both the Onex - Canadian proposal and the Air Canada - Lufthansa - United proposal envision a major role for foreign air carriers and investors . 
where does the government stand on the current rules for foreign ownership and participation in the industry ? 
does it endorse the current rules or does it have plans to revise them ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have always said that the government would consider any regulatory or statutory change that would enhance the viability and competitiveness of the Canadian airline system , and we will do just that . 
we feel very strongly that not only should the government outline the five principles as I did the other week , but that we should seek the input of parliamentarians on this very important matter . 
that is why the committee is meeting . 
we will be guided on all of these issues by members of the House and of the Senate . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it will be a novel day when the government talks to us and consults the advice of the House . 
hundreds of thousands of air travellers want assurances that they will continue to have a quality service at the lowest possible cost . 
we have tens of thousands of workers in this industry who want to be assured that there is a place for them in the future . 
all regions of the country want to be assured that particular routes and services of importance to them will be addressed . 
where is the government ' s policy framework to ensure that all of these interests will be properly addressed ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very glad that the Leader of the Opposition is adhering to the five principles that the government enunciated a few weeks ago . 
that is the outline of our framework and over the next few weeks we will be putting more detail on the policy , but we will not do it unilaterally . 
the Leader of the Opposition would be the first one to condemn us if we came in here with a policy , put it on the floor of the House of Commons and ignored the views of members of this House .

pay EQUITY 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the federal court ruled that the government is on the hook for $ 5 billion in its pay equity dispute . 
we know there is a very good chance that the government is going to lose its appeal . 
my question is for the Minister of Finance . 
does the government have a contingency fund large enough to cover this $ 5 billion , or does this mean the end of any meaningful tax relief for Canadians ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we read the decision this morning and we are in the process of analyzing it . 
it is an important decision for all federal employees . 
we will take the time we need before reaching a decision . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am going to address this question again to the finance minister . 
why does the minister not just admit that the government has mishandled the file and it is the taxpayers who are going to have to pay for this fiasco ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be clear . 
we have just received the judgment . 
we are looking at it . 
there is a big difference between the government ' s position and the position of the Reform Party . 
the Reform Party does not believe in pay equity . 
we believe in pay equity .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the copyright scandal is not limited just to the CINAR production house . 
apparently , many people are involved in this scandal and millions of dollars are said to have been obtained illegally from the federal government . 
does the Minister of National Revenue not think it is becoming important that his department take action and that he order it to conduct a special investigation into the illegal practices in this industry ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , information involving the relationship between the department and an individual or corporate taxpayer is confidential and I may therefore not comment . 
if ever additional events were brought to the attention of my department and myself , obviously we would see that the necessary action was taken , but for now the information is confidential . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
i think that the newspapers have been sufficiently eloquent . 
we know that names were used , that phony corporations were set up by law firms for the purpose of diverting federal public funds . 
does the Minister of National Revenue not understand that it is his duty to call for an investigation ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
i believe there is a strong relationship of trust . 
what we are talking about here is information that is basically confidential , and it will remain so . 
at the risk of repeating myself , if ever additional information is brought to our attention , we will see that the necessary action is taken . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the leader of the Bloc Quebecois revealed that the name of Thomas LaPierre , son of the chairman of the board of Telefilm , had been used by CINAR in order to illegally obtain federal funding for production assistance . 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
since the name É rika Alexandre , a pseudonym made up of the first names of the children of CINAR president , Mrs. Charest , has already been identified as a possible link to the same type of fraud , has the Minister of Canadian Heritage asked her departmental staff to make the necessary checks in order to confirm or deny this ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Friday , following the allegations made by the Bloc Quebecois , I asked the RCMP to conduct an investigation . 
among other things , I do know that Montreal urban community police officers will be in Ottawa this Thursday to meet with officials from Canadian Heritage and National Revenue . 
they have been informed of all the allegations that have been made . 
that is precisely why we have asked the RCMP to investigate . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for the benefit of the minister , is she also aware that the name of Patricia Lavoie , Vice - President , Production and Fiction Development at CINAR , has apparently also been used to illegally obtain funding for the film Who Gets the House , the screen - writer of which was in reality the American Timothy Neilson ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member has any allegations to make , let him do so , and I shall put him directly in contact with the RCMP . 
this will cast the necessary light on all the facts and I can put the hon. member in direct contact with the RCMP if he wishes . 
* * * 
pay EQUITY 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fight for pay equity has been going on for 15 years . 
the courts keep rejecting the government ' s appeals one after the other . 
yet , the federal government keeps denying women the right to equal pay for work of equal value . 
when will the government stop appealing the rulings made by the courts and when will it finally pay what is owed to its female employees ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is clearly committed to the principle of pay equity for women and men . 
the ruling was issued today . 
it is only normal that we take a few days to look at it , to discuss with the various stakeholders , including the attorney general , so that we can make the best possible decision . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this government supports the pay equity principle as long as it does not have to treat women as equals , as long as it does not have to pay any money . 
however , when it is required to actually obey the law and pay , its principles go out the window . 
its words say yes , but its actions say no . 
why will the government not treat women as equals ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this ruling is very important for all federal public service employees . 
therefore , it only makes sense that , as a responsible government , we would take time to analyse it . 
i can assure you that we will then act . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
air Canada today announced its proposal for a restructuring of the Canadian airline industry and in that proposal it requested a full merger review process by the Competition Bureau . 
will the minister require that all proposals , either present or future , go through the same process so that they are all treated the same ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member knows , under section 47 the Competition Bureau is very much engaged . 
in fact , I asked the bureau for its advice on the restructuring and that report should be coming to me in the next few days . 
it will be made public and it will be the subject of discussions at the Standing Committee on Transport . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in fact the Competition Bureau is there to protect consumers . 
the Competition Bureau is there to protect consumers for a good reason and it serves a good purpose for the country . 
my question is simple . 
one proposal will accept a full review by the Competition Bureau . 
will the minister require all proposals to go through the same process , or is there favoured treatment ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the treatment we have treats everyone equally and that is the treatment envisaged under section 47 as I have just described . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is hiding behind the judicial robes of the Supreme Court of Canada and its new federal representative in the Marshall decision . 
its own Captain Canada , the Liberal Premier of Newfoundland , has said that the Supreme Court of Canada has to take responsibility for the anarchy in the maritimes . 
the Marshall decision must be reviewed , not entrenched as government policy . 
the troubles on the east coast could end today if the government acted . 
why will the government not reject the fisheries policy that assigns jobs on the basis of race ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious that the member does not understand the issue . 
this is about a treaty right which is recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada . 
over and over again we have said that we recognize and respect that treaty right . 
we will work within the spirit of the supreme court judgment . 
that is exactly what we are doing now . 
we are looking at a long term solution to the issue . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the fisheries minister has delusions of adequacy . 
the supreme court has willy - nilly determined that Canada ' s fishery should be regulated along blood lines . 
i find that offensive and the government should too . 
the West Nova Fishermen ' s Coalition is seeking clarification of the Marshall decision . 
the government refuses to support it . 
why does the minister not stand now and tell the House how many maritime fisheries jobs he is prepared to sacrifice to satisfy his race based fisheries policy ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans I want to ensure that we create more jobs out there . 
if the hon. member has been listening , we are talking about emerging products , marketing some of their products and aquaculture .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in March 1997 , following the first investigation by the RCMP , the attorney general decided not to lay charges against CINAR . 
barely one month later , Ms. Charest , the president , hosted a Liberal Party benefit supper with the Prime Minister . 
i would like the Prime Minister to explain the coincidence between the favorable decision by the attorney general with respect to CINAR , a decision that is hard to explain , and Ms. Charest ' s involvement in the Liberal Party . 
the Speaker : 
i will permit the question , but it must be remembered that questions regarding a political party are not permitted in the House . 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is again making allegations in the House . 
these are very serious allegations , and I think that if he does have allegations to make , he should make them to the RCMP . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the president of CINAR is involved in the Liberal Party of Canada . 
the Prime Minister himself appointed her to the board of the Millennium Scholarship Foundation . 
Telefilm must investigate this whole matter , as the name of the son of the president is being used and Mr. Macerola , the former Liberal candidate and executive director of Telefilm , says it is an urban myth . 
what we want to know is who is the main player in the urban myth , which might be called " In the Kingdom of the Cronies '' ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
investigations are necessary and for this very reason we have asked the RCMP to get involved . 
if the member and the Bloc Quebecois have allegations , they should pass them on directly to the RCMP .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . 
the Supreme Court of Canada has generated serious conflict and confrontation by declaring a special native only commercial fishery on the east coast of Canada . 
in spite of the very obvious problems that come from treating Canadians differently , the minister is about to ratify the Nisga ' a agreement , effectively creating the exact same special native only commercial fishery on the west coast of Canada . 
why in the world would the minister promote such a concept in the Nisga ' a treaty when he knows full well the kinds of serious problems that come with it ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the reason I am doing it is because it is the right thing to do for B.C. and for Canada . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government had a wonderful opportunity to negotiate equality into the Nisga ' a agreement but it went for special status and special legal rights instead . 
ordinary Nisga ' a people will pay the biggest price for that folly in the end . 
why are the minister and the government prepared to promote disunity , division and discord rather than equality ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this will bring certainty and foster economic development in the member ' s backyard . 
i would suggest to the member , knowing that he has 24 first nations of his own and he does not talk to them , that he get some advice from them . 
the advice they would give him is that this is the right thing to do for B.C. , for that particular region of British Columbia , and for Canada in the long run . 
he should support it .

genetically ALTERED FOODS 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is in great disarray over genetically altered foods . 
the Minister of Industry wants to promote them at all costs , the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food wants to export them without knowing their effects , the Minister of Health does not have enough staff to evaluate them , and the Minister of the Environment is blocking the adoption of an international protocol on biosafety . 
will the Prime Minister finally tell them to quit playing around and make the quality of food a priority ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canadian public and consumers of Canadian food around the world can be very proud of our regulatory system to ensure the safety of Canadian food . 
any genetically enhanced foods go through a very stringent regulatory process to ensure that they are safe for humans , for animals and for the environment before they are approved . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , does the Prime Minister realize that , if the safety of genetically altered foods cannot be guaranteed , this industry will lose the trust of consumers at home and abroad ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the regulatory and approval processes that are used to determine the safety of food applications in Canada are based on science , the best science available today . 
the science process is approved by the World Health Organization , by the FAO and by all international bodies . 
it is peer tested science and we use it to judge the safety of any applications . 
nothing is approved unless it passes that stringent safety assessment .

national DEFENCE 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , access to information is a fundamental right of all Canadians . 
i have in my possession a letter from the information commissioner which reveals that the Minister of National Defence routinely delayed release of access by several months so that his staff could prepare speaking notes for the minister . 
why did the Minister of National Defence put his own political interests above the legal rights of all Canadians ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to make sure that people get the access to information they are entitled to just as quickly as they can . 
i only asked that I be informed so that I could respond to any concerns that might be raised by members of the House or by the public . 
i certainly have made it very clear to the Department of National Defence and to all my staff that access to information regulations are to be fully followed and information is to be provided as quickly as possible . 
that is being done . 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister told his executive assistant to tell departmental officials not to respond to access requests until the minister ' s spin doctors were finished with them . 
the information commissioner said in his letter to me that this action was improper interference . 
improper interference is very serious for a minister of the crown . 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member has it all wrong . 
if the member wants the letter from me to the department and to my staff indicating exactly the opposite , I am quite happy to provide it .

pay EQUITY 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , federal public servants have been waiting 15 years for pay equity . 
in 1993 , the Prime Minister promised to honour the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal . 
the government certainly has the money to pay its employees . 
will the President of the Treasury Board formally undertake today to stop using the courts and to pay public servants without further delay ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I formally undertake to respect the principle of pay equity . 
that having been said , we must be allowed the time to go through the decision carefully in order to understand the impact and to conduct the necessary consultations . 
however , I can tell public servants that they will hear what this government plans to do in a few days .

SOMMET DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Raymond Bonin ( Nickel Belt , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as host country for the 8 th Sommet de la Francophonie , Canada welcomed heads of state and of government from more than 40 countries . 
can the Secretary of State for the Francophonie tell the House to what extent Canada took advantage of the summit as a forum for getting certain countries to make commitments relating to human rights ? 
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel ( Secretary of State ( Western Economic Diversification ) ( Francophonie ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada was able to exchange views on a number of issues such as democratization and the respect of human rights . 
as well , Canada saw that its concerns and intentions relating to these issues were raised in the Moncton declaration . 
canada has shared the parallel summit ' s documentation with all delegations that were in attendance . 
i can assure my colleagues that Canada had a hand in the progress of democracy at the Moncton Summit .

telecommunications 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
Rogers Cable has announced an increase of $ 1.90 a month , well in excess of the rate of inflation . 
this is what happens when we have a monopoly : consumers get hosed , consumers get gouged . 
my question is for the minister responsible for the CRTC , the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
will she step in and block this unconscionable increase ? 
will she go to bat for consumers and ensure that cable companies do not willy - nilly increase rates to the detriment of consumers ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) : 
i am asking the minister to use her authority as the Minister of Canadian Heritage to stop these unconscionable increases in cable TV rates . 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as a lawyer the member will know that in fact the CRTC is a quasi - judicial body and as such it would be very inappropriate for me to interfere with it . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , after processing only four of the six hundred migrants who arrived on our shores this summer , the IRB has denied all four refugee claims and then released them . 
it would seem that the government is determined to assist the efforts of organized crime by releasing claimants whether or not they are refugees . 
how could the minister allow bogus refugees to be released in Canada , knowing that they are likely to disappear ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to make it very clear to this member and to everyone that I deplore human smuggling . 
i am very concerned about the welfare of the people who are in the hands of those smugglers . 
the IRB is an independent quasi judicial process . 
it has assured me that it will accelerate the determination procedure . 
the department is making arguments to detain those individuals on the grounds that there is fear of flight until we have their identity and know who they are , or if there are criminal proceedings . 
that is the law . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , unlike the Reform Party , the government is determined to enforce the charter of rights not just for some of the people some of the time , but for all of the people in Canada all of the time . 
part of that procedure is to allow the IRB to do its work and make its decisions . 
the department will continue to argue before an adjudicator to detain when we believe the detention is warranted . 
however , it is a quasi judicial , independent body and we will not interfere with its process . 
* * * 
agriculture 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food . 
the minister seems to be sending out conflicting signals as to whether or not there will be any additional funding over and above the AIDA money for hard - pressed prairie farmers . 
for example , last week following the meeting with the counterparts from Saskatchewan and Manitoba , the hon. minister hinted that the generous support payments in Europe and the United States could result in some new money for Canadian farmers . 
will there be any new money before Christmas for prairie farmers to help them through the worst financial crisis in more than 60 years ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
the hon. member knows that I have had discussions with the safety net advisory committee . 
we are looking at some more possible changes to that program as time goes on . 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this issue is really of critical importance everywhere in rural and urban Manitoba and Saskatchewan . It is sufficiently important that two agriculture ministers were here last week to meet with the minister . 
it is important enough that the premiers of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are expected to be here next week to press the case . 
this issue goes far beyond partisan politics and deserves a clear , straightforward answer . 
will any new moneys be made available for prairie farmers before the end of this year , yes or no ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is obviously not listening . 
i just said that we have been consulting with the two new recently appointed ministers and the other provincial ministers and with the safety net advisory committee . 
we are looking at possible changes that , if made , will certainly assist farmers before Christmas , as the AIDA program is already doing . 
we are making it as flexible and innovative as possible . 
* * * 
merchant MARINES 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs . 
it is time for justice for the merchant mariners . 
the merchant navy suffered the highest loss of life ratio versus any arm of the armed forces in World War II. 
if they had received a $ 1,000 benefit in 1946 it would be worth $ 21,000 today . 
when will the minister deliver a fair and dignified compensation package to the merchant mariners so they will not be forced into another hunger strike ? 
hon. George S . Baker ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have discussed the matter with the Merchant Navy Coalition , the Merchant Navy War Veterans Association , the Royal Canadian Legion and the National Council of War Veterans Associations . 
this is under discussion , as all matters are under discussion concerning veterans , because we want to maintain our international standing as giving the best services to our veterans compared to any nation in the world . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have heard that old tune before from the previous minister . 
it is an insult to them . 
will the minister inform the House today that he will give $ 20,000 compensation packages to the merchant mariners ? 
hon. George S . Baker ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when that government was in power it said no to the merchant navy veterans when they asked for what this government gave under Bill C - 61 . 
it said no to the merchant navy veterans when they asked to have discussed what we are discussing today . 
the hon. member should cross the floor and say thank you to the Prime Minister for the Liberal yes instead of the typical Tory no .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when Onex made an offer to purchase the shares of Air Canada , the Minister of Transport set out five principles to guide the government in approving any potential merger . 
this very day , Air Canada has just made an offer . 
if either of these offers goes through , would Canadians have any guarantee of access to bilingual air services from coast to coast in Canada ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :

royal CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , is the solicitor general listening ? 
the chronic underfunding of the RCMP is aiding and abetting rip - off artists . 
when will the minister come forward with funds to support the RCMP ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is aware of some historic problems with the RCMP . 
that is why Treasury Board conducted a review . 
the government has given a lot of funding to support the RCMP . 
* * * 
employment INSURANCE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Human Resources Development said in her former position that she had compassion for native women . 
they , on the other hand , have constantly complained about her inability to resolve their problems . 
today , the minister is saying she has compassion for women who are denied employment insurance . 
now that she is looking after employment insurance , will she act as she did in her last department , or will she finally understand that the vast majority of women are denied employment insurance because of the eligibility rules ? 
can she understand that ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear . 
the government has spoken out loudly and clearly in support of women . 
last week the Prime Minister doubled the parental benefits that will be available to families in the year 2001 . 
he talked about making the benefits more flexible and more accessible . 
we are acting . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Labour Congress study confirms what we have known for a long time : woman have been penalized by the employment insurance reform . 
the government said it wanted to address the new realities of the labour market . 
but women , young people , seasonal workers and independent and part time workers have all been abandoned by the employment insurance reform . 
the Liberal government has really missed the boat . 
when will the Minister of Human Resources Development change employment insurance to really address the realities of the labour market for everyone ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the CLC is strongly supportive of the government ' s undertaking to double parental benefits . 
the CLC is also , as we are , very happy to see the most recent labour force statistics proving that after 20 years we now have the lowest female adult unemployment level at 5.9 % .

pay EQUITY 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the federal court issued a clear ruling : the federal government must pay what it owes to its public servants under the principle of pay equity . 
will the President of the Treasury Board comply with that ruling and finally do justice to these public servants , who are predominantly women ? 
will the government comply with its own legislation and pay its public servants , or will it appeal once again ? 
the minister is a woman . 
i am convinced she understands the problems that women are facing . 
today , she has an opportunity to show that she can make decisions that will be fair for women and of benefit to them . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again , we support the principle of pay equity , of equal pay for equal work . 
that being said , we have just received the ruling today . 
it is perfectly normal for a responsible government to not only take time to read the ruling , but also to analyse its impact , so as to make a well - informed decision . 
and this is what we will do in the coming days .

SIERRA LEONE 
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa . 
with so many conflicts going on in the world , little attention has been paid to the terrible tragedy of Sierra Leone . 
with a fragile peace deal now in place , what is Canada doing to support peace and stability in this area ? 
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada supports the proposal to establish a new UN presence and peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone , including 6,000 peacekeepers . 
we have been working closely on the motion which we expect will be voted on Friday at the Security Council . 
we have donated approximately $ 10 million in the last two years .

royal CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
another portion went to pay down the deficit , leaving only $ 1.5 million of the $ 10 million . 
the $ 10 million does not exist . 
we have a problem . 
the commercial fraud and rip - off are not being investigated because of lack of resources for the RCMP . 
when will the minister come forward with proper resources for the RCMP to protect Canadian consumers ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I indicated a list of things that the government has put in place like the DNA databank and many other things .

government ORDERS 
personal INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 6 , an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act , as reported ( with amendment ) from the standing committee ; and of motions in Group No. 1 . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will now start where I left off earlier . 
i will remind members who are joining us just now that we are debating Bill C - 6 promoting electronic commerce and the protection of personal information . 
i was explaining that Quebec already has legislation to protect that field of activity and that a new federal law will only make things more complicated for the organizations that will have to abide by it , in view of the double jurisdiction that will exist because the federal government did not recognize the precedence of the Quebec act in this field . 
in fact , in its March 1999 brief , the Conseil du Patronat stated " However , since subsection 92 ( 13 ) of the British North America Act clearly gives the provinces jurisdiction in the area of protection of personal information and privacy and since Quebec has already enacted legislation within its jurisdiction and its borders , many jurisdictional disputes can be expected '' . 
of course , when the Conseil made that statement , it expected the federal legislation as it stands today to be passed . 
the Conseil further stated " As for Quebec consumers , they would constantly be forced to try and determine which legislation applies and choose between two types of remedies , depending on whether their information is protected by one statute or the other '' . 
it is important to really understand the situation because consumers will have some recourse if they feel their personal information has not been protected . 
however , they will have to know if it was the federal legislation or the Quebec legislation that was supposed to protect them . 
also , the Quebec Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information appeared before the committee to explain about all the problems the implementation of both these acts would cause in the field and to stress that , in the end , Quebecers have a lot to lose given the complexity of this legal issue and the fact that they are the most protected consumers in the country . 
if passed , this bill aimed at protecting consumers in the rest of Canada , in other words the nine provinces that do not have such legislation , will penalize Quebec consumers because the federal government has not recognized in its bill the existence of Quebec ' s act and the fact that the province has jurisdiction over this area . 
other groups made their voices heard . 
i am thinking for instance of the Barreau du Qu é bec , whose brief also stressed the complexity of such an act . 
it said " This means that from now on a huge number of Quebec based businesses will be subject to the federal act rather than Quebec ' s , which will not make it any easier for citizens trying to know what their rights are in this context of legislative changes . 
moreover , businesses based in Quebec will have to master a new personal information protection system slightly different from Quebec ' s '' . 
the Barreau further stated that it supports the recommendation made by the Access to Information Commission , which reads " In order to avoid any confusion and insure that Quebecers continue to enjoy the benefits of a full personal information protection system , we submit that Bill C - 54 should be amended in order to provide that the act will not apply to businesses already subject to the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector Act '' . 
accordingly , businesses would be subject to the existing act . 
the Barreau goes further still , saying " In our view , the bill should incorporate Quebec ' s act , even with respect to federal areas of jurisdiction , so as to avoid confusion , overlap and duplication of legislation in Quebec '' . 
this is a very interesting point of view . 
normally , the federal government ' s approach is always the opposite . 
the federal government is the one interfering in provincial jurisdictions . 
we can see that , when this government says , for instance , that it wants to work with the provinces to improve the quality of life of Canadians , in practice that is not what interests it . 
what interests it is to extend its authority , to acquire greater and greater control , to be the government that plans our economic and social development and controls the protection of personal information , and so on . 
day after day , in one issue after another , this government bulldozes ahead , taking over one jurisdiction after another . 
and , if no amendments are made , this is what is going to happen again . 
we are at report stage . 
there is still time for the government to amend the bill . 
it could include provisions acknowledging the existence of Quebec ' s act and providing the legal framework necessary for the development of e - commerce - we are not just talking about personal information in the electronic domain in this bill ; its scope is much broader - as well as ensuring the protection of personal information under the legislation that already exists in Quebec . 
in this way , a reasonable balance and a workable solution could be found . 
i hope that there are still some sensible people left across the way and that their beautiful speeches will translate into something concrete . 
that is something we will see in the course of the debate and there will be an opportunity to hear what a number of my colleagues have to say about the bill this afternoon . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased today to speak to the first group of amendments to Bill C - 6 which was formally known as Bill C - 44 . 
we agree that there needs to be some certainty in the area of privacy . 
we agree there needs to be some certainty in the rules surrounding the whole electronic commerce section of business , a fairly new area . 
we are a little concerned that the government was probably a bit remiss in not trying to get a more co - operative approach from the provinces before embarking on its experiment in terms of privacy in the area of business , but we recognize that it is required . 
my understanding is that there is a three year timeframe for the provinces to introduce their own privacy legislation . 
i think it is regrettable , though , that a consensus could not have been reached to allow for the provinces to be part of a program that would introduce legislation on their own . 
the federal government has decided to go out on its own , and my hon. colleague reminds me that it is a three year phase - in . 
the answer is that the provinces will have three years to introduce legislation in this area of privacy . 
however , if they are not able to do that or choose not to , the federal legislation will take precedent and become the legislation in the land in the areas of privacy in commerce and business . 
that still leaves the other amendments that we will be dealing with in section 2 to which I want to speak later on . 
we agree that there needs to be rules and legislation surrounding the area of privacy . 
although we would have preferred to have a co - operative approach , most of the provinces will be introducing their own legislation to cover this area in the next three years . 
therefore the federal legislation will probably not even come into effect . 
the provinces may have better legislation in those areas of their own which they want to put in place , and I would encourage them to do that in this timeframe . 
the Reform Party supports the part 1 amendments . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , I cannot say how delighted I am to speak on Bill C - 6 on personal information protection and the electronic documents act . 
the reason I am delighted is that today we were talking about perhaps the birth of a whole new economy for the country . 
others have described it in the last 24 hours as electronic commerce becoming the central nervous system of business , society and even of government . 
we truly are into a form of commercial revolution , the consequences of which are almost unpredictable . 
the fantastic growth in the use of the Internet in terms of business to business relationships as well as consumer to business relationships is nothing short of astonishing . 
to illustrate this , Internet traffic doubles every 100 days and every second of the day seven new clients sign up on the Internet . 
it truly is a revolution that is happening before us . 
like all revolutions we actually do not realize there is a revolution going if we are part of it . 
one day we wake up and realize that the entire world has changed . 
i suspect during the industrial revolution people were not standing around talking about the revolution that was going on , except when they looked back and realized the tremendous change that had occurred . 
i believe , as we have heard from the Minister of Industry , the Prime Minister and government spokespersons in a variety of capacities in the last number of weeks , that Canada is to become the most electronically connected country in the world by the year 2000 . 
there was the commitment the other day to set up 600 Internet sites across the country and to mobilize 10,000 young people to serve those sites to ensure that every Canadian from coast to coast to coast , no matter where they live , no matter the size of their community , no matter the resources at their disposal will have access to the Internet of one kind or another . 
i refer to what happened last month at Microsoft when hackers broke into the hot mail service , exposing 40 million accounts and the integrity of the e - mail system . 
this kind of high profile breach of security obviously is something that consumers are concerned about . 
madam Speaker , I know that you are an e - commerce fan and I suspect that when you talk to your constituents about electronic commerce the kind of thing you hear is what the rest of us hear and that is that people are concerned about the security of the information they provide . 
when we send off our credit card number or when we carry out a business transaction , is it secure ? 
do we have confidence that the person receiving that information is the person that we expect to be receiving that information ? 
in Canada the electronic commerce section will grow from $ 1 billion in 1997 to about $ 13 billion by 2002 . 
there is an incredible rate of economic change that is occurring before us . 
in 1998 there were 414,000 active commercial websites and by 2002 it is predicted that number will jump to 1.6 million . 
it is astonishing economic activity that is occurring before us . 
bill C - 6 attempts to build in some security in terms of personal information . 
today we are dealing with the motions in Group No. 1 . 
i want to say on behalf of the federal New Democratic Party that we will be opposing the motions in Group No. 1 put forward by the Bloc Quebecois . 
the reason is obvious . 
bloc members believe , and they make a compelling argument , that we should have one system for the province of Quebec and one system for the rest of the country . 
obviously that is going to be a messy , patchwork system of protection . 
we represent all Canadians in the House and we want to have a policy that will protect Canadians from coast to coast to coast . 
it is lacking in most other jurisdictions of the country . 
however , to pass federal legislation that does not include all provinces and territories I think would be folly . 
we do not want a patchwork of different standards across the country . 
national standards are crucial . 
for that reason we feel that we must oppose this group of amendments . 
it is not right or fair that some Canadians should be deprived of privacy protection because their provincial government has been slow to act . 
the reality is that there are some provinces that are dragging their feet on this issue . 
i suspect one of the reasons is that they really do not know what to do . 
the provincial governments are looking to the federal government to say that rather than all of the provincial jurisdictions introducing their own protective legislation , why not have a decent standard from coast to coast to coast introduced by the federal government , which is what Bill C - 6 is all about . 
in other policy areas where there is federal and provincial overlap both levels of government will be required to co - operate to ensure the strongest protection is given to Canadians and to reduce any confusion . 
i listened carefully to the speech made by my hon. friend from the Bloc Quebecois , who argued that in his judgment the legislation presently in place in Quebec would be adequate . 
let us ensure that whatever is the best piece of legislation to protect the consumer will be the piece of legislation that will dominate . 
in conclusion , we support the federal government in its efforts to exercise its commerce power in respect to privacy protection . 
we support the intent of the legislation generally , and for that reason I am afraid we will have to oppose the motions in Group No. 1 . 
we on the government side oppose the motions in Group No. 1 . 
in our consultations at the industry committee , consumer groups and industry expressed the view that the government has achieved the right balance in Bill C - 6 between the right of individuals to have some control over their personal information and to have access to avenues for effective redress , and the need of industry to collect and use personal information as a vital component of success in the information economy . 
for these reasons , consumer groups like the Public Interest Advocacy Centre , the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Consumers ' Association of Canada , and industry groups like the Information Technology Association of Canada , the Canadian Marketing Association and the cable and telephone companies have all called for rapid passage of Bill C - 6 . 
swift passage of Bill C - 6 will help build the consumer trust and market certainty needed to ensure that Canada is a world leader in electronic commerce and the global information economy . 
the motions tabled by the Bloc are unacceptable and must be rejected . 
with the passage of Bill C - 6 Quebec citizens will benefit from the best data protection in the country . 
bill C - 6 will provide all Canadians , and I stress , all Canadians , including those in the province of Quebec , complete and comprehensive privacy coverage across our country . 
quite frankly , I would have expected better of the Bloc than to table amendments which deprive all Canadians , who have no privacy protection in the private sector , of getting the benefits of this national law . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I welcome this opportunity to speak to this bill , not so much because it is back on the agenda but because I get a chance to clarify the situation once again . 
bill C - 6 is the resurrection of Bill C - 54 . 
the purpose of this bill is to implement legislation to protect personal information at the federal level , when similar legislation already exists in Quebec . 
this bill will enable the federal government to interfere in a provincial jurisdiction in spite of the fact that Quebec already has a legislation protecting all personal information . 
this seems to me to be a rather absurd situation . 
i would like to quote from a letter to industry minister John Manley and signed by Denis Marsolais , the president of the Chambre des notaires du Qu é bec , copy of which was sent to us by this organization . 
it reads as follows : 
we submit that overlapping systems will cause undue misunderstandings and complications both for consumers and organizations subjected to two sets of regulations dealing with a single matter . 
this is not a separatist speaking , but the president of the Chambre des notaires du Qu é bec . 
i point this out to the previous speaker , who said that it is not surprising to see the Bloc Quebecois take this standpoint . 
the Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to take this standpoint ; there is a consensus throughout Quebec . 
the president of the Chambre des notaires also stated : 
even more disturbing is part 2 of the bill . 
clause 38 recognizes the validity of electronic versions of notarial acts in Quebec which are referred to in a federal law , not only if they are recognized as such under the laws of the province of Quebec but also if they are listed in one of the schedules of the legislation . 
these schedules would be maintained by the minister , an agency or anyone given the authority to modify them . 
for all these reasons and many more - 
this implies that not all the reasons were listed . 
- we believe - 
this is the president of the Chambre des notaires du Qu é bec speaking , not a separatist member of Parliament , as my colleague opposite would have you believed . 
the president of the Chambre des notaires du Qu é bec represents all the notaries in Quebec . 
this point of view is shared by all Quebecers , all interested parties , not only the sovereignists , not only the separatists , but even the federalists in Quebec . Everyone in Quebec knows that , for five years now , we have had an act to protect personal information , not only in the government but also in the private sector . 
this is utterly false . 
it is a matter of how things are supposed to work . 
there is already legislation under Quebec ' s jurisdiction . 
we live in a distinct society . 
it is not mentioned in any legislation and whenever Quebec ' s distinct character , society and people have to be recognized in a bill , there is no mention of it . 
liberal members say that this is the position promoted by the Bloc , by the separatists , but I invite all Canadians to assess the situation . 
on the one hand , the federal government wants to introduce a bill on electronic commerce that also covers the area of personal information , while , on the other hand , Quebec has already passed a groundbreaking bill whose value was recognized by people around the world . 
it would appear to be saying to Quebec " You people think in a different way '' . 
the hon. member used the term " national legislation '' . 
it reminds me of all the fuss about the national capital . 
the federal government claims to be the national government . 
i am sorry but , under the constitution , it is merely the federal government and should act as such , respecting the jurisdictions of other governments . 
Quebec has jurisdiction over personal information , and it has exercised that jurisdiction quite well for 15 or 20 years , because it has legislation in place and has enforced it . 
when we look at the whole situation , it must be understood that the position the Bloc Quebecois is fighting for is the result of a consensus in Quebec . 
it is supported by all kinds of organizations . 
for example , we have a letter from the Chambre des notaires to Mr. Manley , dated April 7 , 1999 , that reads - 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the hon. member knows very well that he cannot name a minister or a member . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te : 
it is an unfortunate oversight on my part , and I apologize . 
can it be any clearer ? 
and it is the president of the Chambre des notaires who is speaking . 
he represents people who deal every day with this act . 
these people draft contracts ; they are in regular contact with governments and private corporations when they sign contracts . 
when Liberal members present this bill in the House , I agree they can defend its validity . 
i have nothing against the fact that they are saying it could be good legislation . 
they have the right to say those things , but they do not have the right to say that we are against it just because we are always against everything the federal government does . 
as far as reasonable and interesting measures are concerned , we have a support rate very similar to that of all other opposition parties . 
however , we withhold support when Quebec ' s interests are at stake and must be defended , when we must ensure that all Quebecers are covered by legislation . 
members need only think of the administrative nightmare and the extra operating costs incurred by an insurance company that has its headquarters in Quebec but does business in other provinces , when two acts based on different sets of basic principles apply . 
the costs could be prohibitive . 
it will also create problems for people affected by these two acts . 
all this because the federal government is determined to pass what it considers national legislation . 
it seems that the government cannot recognize that there can be solutions that are not all inclusive . 
it must always include all of Canada . 
for the government , all problems must be addressed the same way , be it in Vancouver , St. John ' s or Quebec City . 
but that , however , is not the reality . 
in Quebec we have a particular civil code . 
the Liberal members should know that . 
especially those from outside Quebec . 
i hope that those from Quebec have known this for a very long time . 
however , I do not see why they cannot be here in the House to say that it makes no sense to vote in favour of this bill . 
why do they not rise and say " As members for Quebec , we are federalists , but in this instance , Quebec legislation must be respected '' . 
i simply cannot understand why party discipline is involved in it . 
i will conclude on this point . 
the federal government has been trying to have us swallow a bill on the protection of personal information for over a year . 
we are defending here all the interests of Quebecers with respect to the matter of personal information . 
we will defend them to the end . 
we will insist on our point until we get satisfaction from the government . 
should the House pass this bill , it will be like all the other measures taken by the federal government that constitute the main reasons we want to leave this country , which does not understand us , and most importantly , which does not want to understand us , because of its invasive action . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I am happy to speak to this bill , now called Bill C - 6 . 
in our last session before we rose for the summer this bill was Bill C - 54 . 
as the previous industry critic , I spent a lot of time on this bill in committee and also talking to industry and other members of the public especially involved in privacy issues . 
i am happy to be able to speak to it today . 
i also want to note that my colleague from Peace River , who is now the industry critic and I think well deservedly , will do an excellent job of representing the Reform Party on industry issues . 
i want to congratulate him on all the hard work he did in his prior post of international trade . 
i look forward to working closely with him as we continue down the road of creating a legal framework around electronic commerce . 
i had many concerns , as does the Bloc , on this issue , especially on the issue of jurisdiction and how privacy specifically falls under the provincial jurisdiction of powers . 
through my discussions in committee and with people in Alberta , I have come to realize that maybe there is not the conflict that the Bloc identifies on these issues . 
as I speak on the motions in Group No. 1 , I want to clarify that we are opposed to the Bloc motions in this group . 
we do in fact support the direction of the government on this legislation . 
my colleague from Peace River will reiterate that as we move to Group No. 2 . 
to summarize specifically what this bill is trying to accomplish , Bill C - 6 creates a legal and regulatory framework that will be applied to the commercial use of sensitive and private information in all areas of business . 
reform supports this initiative to protect privacy . 
reform supports limited government and free enterprise , but recognizes the important role of government in creating an economic climate in Canada with fair and transparent rules that protect both consumers and businesses . 
this is also exactly where my second concern came up during the course of dealing with this legislation , especially in committee . 
is the government in creating this legal framework and formulating this legislation going to be too heavy handed on the businesses that are engaging in electronic commerce and respecting privacy currently , thereby actually putting a disincentive on industry to continue with the work it has done to allow electronic commerce to flourish in this country ? 
this is where we have to separate the two areas of privacy and electronic commerce . 
often that gets confusing because both are very important . 
they have to be treated as equally important , but there are distinct differences between electronic commerce and privacy . 
one of things brought to my attention while sitting on the committee was that if one looks at how electronic commerce has developed and begun to flourish , a lot of this has been done with relatively no government intervention until now . 
over $ 1 billion of trade is being done through electronic commerce , whether it is through the Internet or other forms of electronic commerce . 
this consumer confidence in electronic commerce has begun with almost entirely no government intervention , which is quite phenomenal if one thinks about it . 
this was one of the points I tried to bring up in committee . 
as I said , one of the things we cannot take lightly is the issue of privacy . 
some of the companies that have been doing business on the Internet have taken privacy very seriously . 
that is why customers , consumers who are currently engaging in trade on the Internet , feel confident enough to disclose information on the Internet and purchase services and goods . 
that is a positive thing because obviously industry is doing its part . 
privacy extends far beyond the provincial jurisdiction , particularly when one starts to use mechanisms of trade that go beyond the national scope and into a global scope . 
therefore , there needs to be some sort of legal framework in place which shows that Canada has certain standards when it comes to privacy that the rest of the world has to take seriously . 
this is why I would like to share with my dear colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois my opinions and those of my party with respect personal information . 
the provincial and federal governments should work together in this area and share responsibilities , because e - commerce is not limited to the provinces , it goes beyond provincial and national borders . 
it is truly a global matter . 
the privacy commissioner in Alberta stated that this fall the government is going to be coming up with legislation that is going to deal specifically with strengthening privacy legislation in Alberta . 
it feels that in doing so it is going to be complementary with the scope of the federal government . 
the federal government has outlined that once this legislation passes , it will allow a window of three years for provinces that currently do not have privacy legislation to put privacy legislation in place and make it as strong as the provinces wish . 
the federal government will work with the provinces to respect that . 
even if there is provincial legislation that is stronger in certain aspects of privacy than the federal legislation , it will take precedence over the federal legislation . 
i encourage my colleagues from the Bloc to look at this because if there are strong privacy laws , and I know Quebec is very proud of its current privacy legislation , it will be complementary to the federal legislation . 
this is one of the big reasons that the Reform Party supports this . 
even in Alberta we have the privacy commissioner and others involved with this particular legislation who say it is going in the right direction and we should support it in its current form . 
the Reform Party will support this legislation , until we see that the government is turning its tide and becoming too heavy handed in the process . 
bill C - 6 includes a two year phase - in timetable after which those provinces that do not have comparable legislation would fall under the federal legislation . 
currently only Quebec has this kind of comprehensive privacy protection . 
Alberta will be coming on board this fall . 
other provinces have determined that they neither have the resources nor the inclination to create their own provincial privacy protection legislation and prefer that this be included under the broad federal legislation . 
the Bloc would like total exemption for any province that has or creates privacy legislation . 
under this legislation that concern is taken care of . 
the difficulty with provincial privacy protection legislation is that for international and interprovincial trade purposes there should be a national standard for privacy protection . 
Canadian businesses have asked for this in order to simplify trade rules . 
those are the most important points to mention during this debate on the Group No. 1 motions . 
we are not really opposed to the fact that there needs to be a balance . 
this legislation is achieving that . 
but we need to keep our minds open to look at electronic commerce in a global perspective and see how legislation can be created that works positively with the provinces . 
this legislation does this and I would encourage my colleagues from the Bloc to consider that and look at ways to strengthen that relationship , especially when it comes to electronic commerce . 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , on behalf of the PC Party of Canada , I am pleased to speak on the Group No. 1 amendments to Bill C - 6 , the personal information protection and electronic documents act . 
before I begin my comments I would like to thank the many witnesses who took time to make submissions either in person or in writing to the Standing Committee on Industry . 
their representations were extremely helpful with respect to bringing new issues to light . 
i pay tribute to all my colleagues who were on the industry committee and the new colleagues who are coming on board because this is definitely a very important area . 
i compliment the government for bringing forth in committee an amendment to clause 18 of the bill which was identical to the one I had sponsored . 
we in the PC Party believe in the need for personal privacy legislation , but we do not feel the government has adequately taken into account the views and concerns of the Ontario and Quebec governments . 
we do not feel it has adequately considered the cost impact of the new regulatory regime in Bill C - 6 on the private sector . 
we do not see the need to pass a law to meet a European Union directive when our number one e - commerce and overall trading partner has adopted a diametrically different approach . 
ninety per cent of all the e - commerce traffic in this country is in trade with the U.S. Therefore I cannot see the need to rush to beat the Americans in this regard because down the road they could adopt a different standard and we would have to change . 
i will speak to the specific amendments tabled in Group No. 1 , all of which were sponsored by the member for T é miscamingue . 
to be fair to the member I note for the record that the industry committee and a Bloc member at the time presented the following motion : 
whereas witnesses were recently heard by the Standing Committee on Industry , on Bill C - 54 concerning the major problems in implementing this legislation ; and took into account the big application difficulties of this bill , 
whereas the Quebec government has repeated its demand that Bill C - 54 be withdrawn , 
that the Committee suspend Clause by Clause consideration of Bill C - 54 and ask the Industry Minister to undertake negotiations with all the provinces , to forestall any constitutional challenge that might impair the attainment of its objectives . 
this motion was defeated by seven to four . 
for example , they supported two of the sixteen amendments I brought forward , but on the major question of overall regulation in the form of excessive power granted to the privacy commissioner and provoking battles with the Ontario and Quebec governments , they refused to budge . 
on behalf of the PC Party I refuse to blindly support Bill C - 6 for the sake of getting a law , any law , on personal privacy and e - commerce . 
they are not laws and should therefore not be enforced as such . 
therefore subclause 18 ( 1 ) as presently drafted is not necessary since Bill C - 6 already provides the privacy commissioner with the tools needed to ensure the compliance of schedule 1 . 
for example , section 11 allows an individual to file a complaint if he or she feels an organization is contravening the legislation or not following a recommended business practice . 
further , clause 12 gives the privacy commissioner the power to investigate all complaints including a complaint that an organization is not following a recommended business practice . 
i reiterate the longstanding objections of a variety of witnesses to the far - ranging powers granted to the privacy commissioner under clauses 12 and 18 . 
while I do not object to extending search and seizure power to the privacy commissioner under Bill C - 6 , it is in the best interest of all concerned that his office be required to obtain prior judicial authorization . 
other witnesses have alluded to the provisions in the bill prompting challenges under the charter of rights and freedom if the privacy commissioner acted upon clause 12 or 18 . 
if there is any reluctance I have in supporting the Group No. 1 amendments , it is due to Motions Nos. 56 and up which deal with parts 2 through 5 . 
most of my objections pertain to part 1 of Bill C - 6 . 
unfortunately the familiar double dose of Liberal arrogance and heavy - handedness has left me with no choice but to support the Group No. 1 amendments on behalf of the Conservative caucus . 
the Liberals had their chance to co - operate at committee to make a substantially better bill and they chose not to do so . 
the minister has failed to put forward a bill whose real objective would be to protect people ' s private lives in the private sector . 
the minister ' s bill is one that gives huge discretionary powers to the governor in council , while not giving any authority to the privacy commissioner . 
this is a bill that puts the emphasis on electronic commerce at the expense of the basic concept of the right to privacy , that ignores Quebec ' s unique experience in the area of personal information protection in the private sector and which , ultimately , could create problems for Quebec ' s current legislation . 
before dealing specifically with some of the major flaws of this bill before us , I want to say a few words about the concept of privacy , which is at the core of this bill , in the context of the Canadian and Quebec legislation . 
the right to privacy is a human right along with the right to equality and justice . 
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which is celebrating this year its fiftieth anniversary and of which Canada is a member , clearly states that everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person . 
the declaration also states that " No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation '' . 
in Canada , this protection is provided under sections 7 and 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
moreover , in 1983 , the Canadian government passed legislation respecting the protection of personal information that applies to over one hundred government agencies under its jurisdiction . 
since then , the federal government has promised an umbrella act to force the private sector to protect personal information . 
bill C - 6 is the sad outcome of all this . 
in Quebec , the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and in the Quebec Civil Code . 
the federal government is once again causing confusion , and this act will give a different meaning to the Privacy Act , just as Bill C - 68 will with respect to the young offenders legislation . 
this is contrary to what Quebec has put in place . 
this bill has many flaws , it is a weak bill whose essence is in its schedule , a small one at that . 
most of the provisions that will govern the protection of personal information are set out in the schedule to the bill . 
moreover , this schedule is nothing more than the model code for the protection of personal information developed by the private sector and consumers as a framework to protect personal information on a voluntary basis . 
by not going beyond this text , the minister endorsed neither the consumers ' recommendations nor those of the privacy commissioners , who recognized that the model code proposed by the Canadian Standard Association was a good basis for reflection , but that it should be reviewed and improved if it ever were to be incorporated in the act . 
this shows beyond any doubt that the minister gave precedence to economic values over social values , at a time when this fundamental right is so threatened by the expansion of electronic commerce . 
this bill gives huge discretion to the governor in council . 
under paragraph 27 ( 2 ) b ) , the federal government gives itself the right to amend the act through a simple order in council , without consulting parliament . 
the Liberal Party knows what I mean . 
this bill gives no power to the Privacy Commissioner . 
although the other Canadian provinces followed Quebec ' s model , giving the commissioner the power to issue orders , the federal act does the exact opposite . 
thus the commissioner will not be able to issue orders , which will make access to the act difficult for consumers and cause it to have no effect on business . 
this bill ignores Quebec ' s unique experience . 
it ignores its unique experience in the protection of personal information in the private sector . 
here are some examples : the objectives of the act are better defined in the Quebec legislation because the purpose is to protect privacy independently of any commercial consideration ; the Quebec legislation clearly covers all undertakings , whether for - profit or not - for - profit , whereas the federal calls for the protection of personal information only for commercial transactions ; Quebec ' s act allows a group of individuals to appoint a representative in a class action case . 
there is no such provision in the federal bill . 
it is therefore obvious that this is a bill with the potential to make life difficult in Quebec . 
in addition to all the flaws that have been pointed out , there is one still greater area of concern . 
the only guarantee Quebec has that it will be exempted from this legislation is a timid statement by the Minister of Industry . 
its mistrust is in large part motivated by Quebec ' s past experience with certain formal commitments made to it , about which the federal government has too often kept mum or which it has denied . 
for example , I will remind this government if I may of the present Prime Minister ' s promises made within days of the 1995 referendum in the Verdun auditorium . 
the stakes are clear , then . 
for the Minister of Industry , it is a question of ensuring that Canada participates fully in the rapidly expanding e - commerce without inordinate concern about peoples ' worries about their privacy . 
nor does the Minister of Industry hesitate to adopt a centralizing position that runs counter in a number of respects to what should be done in the provinces of Canada , and could have served as a model to Quebec in particular . 
as the Deputy Premier of Quebec so aptly put it , " If Quebec were to participate fully in the concert of nations , its culture and the protection of its policy on the privacy of personal information , as concretized in its charter , its Civil Code and its two pieces of privacy legislation , would have been advanced by its government at the Ottawa OECD meeting in Ottawa '' . 
the Bloc Quebecois calls for immediate withdrawal of Bill C - 6 . 
routine PROCEEDINGS 
committees OF THE HOUSE 
transport 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Scarborough - Rouge River , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I think you will find unanimous consent in the Chamber to the following motion dealing with the televised hearings of the transport committee . 
i move : 
that the House , pursuant to Standing Order 119.1 ( 1 ) , 
authorize the Standing Committee on Transport to televise the meetings between October 20 , 1999 and December 19 , 1999 during its study on the future of the airline industry in Canada , in accordance with the guidelines pertaining to televising committee proceedings . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
government ORDERS 
personal INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 6 , an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act , reported from the committee ( with amendment ) , and of motions in Group No. 1 . 
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise today on Bill C - 6 , which affects a fundamental value in our society , privacy protection . 
the debate goes beyond these walls . 
on November 2 , 1998 , parliamentarians , as well as Quebecers , had the opportunity to read in Le Devoir an article entitled " Pressure is mounting for consumers ' privacy protection '' . 
the article talked about threats against our privacy and the need for citizens to be well informed of their rights . 
yet , the need for legislation protecting personal information and privacy is not new . 
most provinces already have such legislation . 
in this instance , the federal government has long been delaying taking its responsibilities by introducing a bill that would apply only to corporations under its jurisdiction . 
in fact , we were expecting something from this government , that it take its cue from provincial laws already in place to introduce a consistent , efficient and clear bill , one that is in keeping with those provinces ' jurisdictions . 
unfortunately for all Quebecers and Canadians , this bill fails miserably . 
instead of protecting privacy , the bill limits itself to protecting the right of big business to make profits with as few restrictions as possible . 
this is totally unacceptable . 
the federal government must get the bill back to the drawing board as quickly as possible . 
it must introduce a bill really aimed at protecting privacy . 
if the government is not yet convinced that it is urgent to act , that the situation is urgent , it should get in touch with the president of the Quebec access to information commission . 
the Minister of Industry would soon find that every month the Quebec government receives 2,000 calls from people concerned about the protection of their privacy . 
the Liberal Party fuels the public ' s cynical attitude toward politicians by using this empty and confused measure to try to convince our fellow citizens that it is concerned about the protection of privacy . 
what the minister responsible is not saying is that the bill is riddled with loopholes and leaves many sectors without any protection . 
those sectors that are covered by this bill are conditionally covered . 
this means that businesses are told to take care , if possible , of their clients ' privacy . 
this is totally unacceptable . 
i want first to stress the fundamental nature of the right to privacy . 
it has been said before , but it is important to remind this House that the Liberal Party is putting the right to make profits before the right to privacy . 
experts consider the right to privacy as a human right , the same as the right to equality and the right to justice . 
thus , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - as cited by several colleagues before me - which was adopted 50 years ago by the United Nations and which Canada adhered to , specifies that everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person and provides that : 
no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation . 
in Canada , the charter of rights and freedoms also protects privacy , although not in so many words . 
in this connection , I would mention that , in Quebec , as members are undoubtedly aware , this right to privacy is recognized explicitly in Quebec ' s 1975 charter of rights and freedoms . 
every person is entitled to privacy . 
this right is also recognized in chapter III of Quebec ' s Civil Code entitled " Respect of Reputation and Privacy '' . 
i draw particular attention to article 35 . 
this is not just something the Bloc Quebecois is pushing . 
i remind members that last April 7 the Chambre des notaires du Quebec wrote a letter to the minister responsible , mentioning this provision in Quebec ' s Civil Code . 
article 35 is clear . 
it says : 
every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and privacy . 
no one may invade the privacy of a person without the consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law . 
that seems clear to me . 
respect of privacy is a fundamental right , which is recognized internationally , as well as in Canada and in Quebec . 
it is ridiculous for the federal government to be introducing a bill that does not protect this fundamental right . 
in addition , many experts say that Quebec ' s act regarding the private sector is one of the best in the world . 
this is a far cry from the federal act , which covers only the public sector . 
it is not so surprising that the federal government did not draw upon the Quebec legislation . 
that would have been killing two birds with one stone . 
on the one hand , it would have ensured consumers of the exemplary protection of personal information , and , on the other hand , it would have avoided the loopholes and violations which are inescapable when enforcing federal and provincial laws which have not been harmonized . 
this leads us to believe that the real object of this bill is not protection of privacy , but a pitiful public relations exercise . 
the government would like to use this legislation to show that it is finally taking heed of people ' s concerns . 
nothing could be further from the truth . 
this bill does not meet the expectations of those who wish for privacy . 
it simply serves the interests of big business . 
even Canada ' s privacy commissioner observed that the discussion paper proposed by Industry Canada and the Department of Justice focuses mainly on commerce , not on privacy . 
that is why we categorically oppose Bill C - 6 . 
the federal government refused to draw from Quebec ' s legislation , even if it is recognized as exemplary in this respect . 
this is not surprising , as the Quebec legislation focuses mainly on the protection of personal information , while the federal bill aims essentially at pleasing big business . 
bill C - 6 - NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , an agreement could not be reached under the provisions of Standing Orders 78 ( 1 ) or 78 ( 2 ) with respect to the report stage and the third reading stage of Bill C - 6 , an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act . 
under the provisions of Standing Order 78 ( 3 ) , I give notice that a minister of the crown will propose at the next sitting a motion to allot a specific number of days or hours for the consideration and disposal of proceedings at these stages . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
are we to understand - and that is what we would like Canadians to realize - that the government is trying to do something that will certainly gag the opposition ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
it is not for the Chair to decide whether something is democratic or not , but only to determine whether it is in order or not . 
obviously , what the leader of the government has indicated is perfectly in order as far as procedure is concerned . 
one never knows . 
Mr. Charlie Penson : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like the House leader to clarify if this is the 65 th or 66 th time that they have used closure since coming to power in 1993 . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am not sure the hon. member has a point of order . 
it may be a matter of great interest that I am sure could be determined by someone . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
Mr. Speaker , just to make sure we understand fully what is going on , could you confirm for the benefit of the members and the viewers that , as parliamentarians , we will be denied our right to speak on a important bill dealing with privacy ? 
could you tell us whether eventually parliamentarians could be denied that right ? 
could you tell us under which Standing Order the government can do this , and do you think as our Speaker who should uphold our rights that this is acceptable in a democracy ? 
i would like to receive some guidance from you on this , Mr. Speaker . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve knows full well that it is almost impossible to deny members of Parliament the right to express their point of view . 
however , under the Standing Orders , the government can put an end to a debate after a certain time . 
as a servant of the House , the Speaker has to ensure that the Standing Orders are respected and that the procedure applied by the government or the opposition is in accordance with the Standing Orders . 
that is all the Speaker can do and is asked to do . 
maybe we could proceed with the debate to avoid wasting time and ensure that the hon. members keep their right to speak and address this important issue . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a Point of order . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
this may be an argument , but it is not a point of order . 
report STAGE 
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 6 , an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act , as reported from the committee ( with amendments ) , and of motions in Group No. 1 . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with what the leader of government has done to us today , namely gagging us , it is with sadness that I am taking part in the debate on report stage of Bill C - 6 , Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act . 
this bill is nothing more that a reincarnation of the bill presented by the Minister of Industry as Bill C - 54 during the first session of this Parliament , and which was unanimously rejected in Quebec . 
the minister tabled his bill in October 1998 without waiting for the comments of his provincial counterparts to whom he had just sent a proposal of bill . 
however , at a meeting held in Fredericton in June of 1998 , the ministers in charge of information highway agreed to consult each other on the opportunity to adopt a legislation concerning personal information protection in the private sector . 
once again , the federal government adopted a unilateral and paternalistic approach and imposed its point of view to the provinces . 
that is not very surprising . 
the Bloc asked that the bill be withdrawn for reasons of principles , including the fact that it had been introduced without consultations and that the bill is an encroachment on provincial jurisdiction over civil law . 
the Bloc also asks for the withdrawal of the bill because it would represent a major weakening of the legal provisions concerning personal information protection in Quebec . 
this is not the first time the liberal government duplicates legislation since I have been elected in this House . 
Quebec ' s legislation is based on the charter of human rights where the protection of personal information is declared a basic right . 
as a matter of fact , section 5 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms says that : " Every person has a right to respect for his private life . " 
this right is also defined and framed in the Quebec Civil Code , which states the basic principles governing the collection , retention and use of personal information . 
it seems the federal government cannot accept the fact that Quebec has the best system in Canada and is adamant about imposing its legislation even if it means reducing the protection now enjoyed by Quebecers . 
and yet , we heard the federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs say in one of his speeches in May 1998 that we had to , and I quote : 
- stop using the easy way out by claiming that a government initiative responds to too much of a pressing need to be stifled by jurisdictional issues - jurisdictional conflicts create confusion that diminishes the quality of public policies . 
obviously , the minister does not do as he says or he does not talk often enough to his colleague , the Minister of Industry , who says it is urgent to legislate to protect the rights of Canadians and uses that as an excuse to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction and to impose a system that is criticized by Quebec ' s society as a whole . 
when the committee held public hearings regarding this bill , every professional , business , labour and consumer organization in Quebec expressed its preference for the system already in place in that province . 
this is why these organizations unanimously requested that Quebec be excluded from the application of the bill we are debating today so that the federal government does not impose upon them , with regard to the protection of personal information , a system that is different from the one that has been in place in Quebec for five years . 
in a letter to the industry minister dated February 4 , the Barreau du Quebec wrote : 
privacy falls under provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights - Generally , we believe that the federal access to information and privacy system is not efficient enough - the bill - should be amended in order to provide explicitly that the federal act does not apply to private sector businesses subjected to the Privacy Act . 
for its part , the Chambre des notaires du Qu é bec , which represents over 3 000 legal professionals , wrote to the industry minister on April 7 to denounce the duplications that would result from this bill being imposed on Quebec , and ask that it be amended to avoid such a situation . 
i will quote from its letter : 
we believe the overlapping of systems will result in undue complications and misunderstandings both for consumers and organizations subject to two different sets of rules in the same area - we believe an amendment is necessary to exclude from its application professionals , notaries , and any individual or organization subject to the Quebec legislation . 
finally , the Conseil interprofessionnel du Qu é bec , with 260,000 members from 43 Quebec professional organizations , also wrote to the Minister of Industry on March 23 to tell him the following : 
Quebec professionals are already governed by a specific and structured set of acts and regulations tailored to the values of the Quebec people - We believe that superimposing several systems with the same intent can only cause confusion and uncertainty about citizens ' rights - The emergence of another comprehensive system might unduly complicate citizens ' life . 
also of concern is the fact that the second part of the bill , which deals with electronic documents , could deprive the provinces from their right to define concepts such as signature , contracts and other procedures that are now covered under civil law . 
another amendment is designed to maintain the privacy protection afforded to Quebecers by provincial legislation when dealing with federal companies doing business in Quebec . 
i am afraid that , once again , the federal government is not listening to Quebec ' s will and putting it in a yoke . 
i condemn the domineering attitude of the federal government , which wants to dictate its will to all the provinces by imposing , from sea to sea , measures that are " made in Ottawa '' , without any concern for effectiveness and without taking into consideration their negative impact on citizens ' rights . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to speak to this bill . 
in light of the notice of motion for time allocation , I even consider it a privilege to be allowed to speak at the report stage of Bill C - 6 , also known as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act . 
this bill is identical to Bill C - 54 brought forward in the last session of Parliament . 
incidentally , the provincial and territorial governments met on October 29 and 30 of last year and exposed the extraordinary intrusion in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions created by Bill C - 54 . 
the government is somehow attempting to recycle it as Bill C - 6 . 
the motion in amendment before us today would delete a number of sections in this bill , which , if adopted , would mark a backward shift in the matter of protection of personal information in Quebec . 
this bill is very weak from a legal point of view and , without any harmonization with Quebec ' s legislation , its enforcement would cause confusion . 
as it now stands , the bill much too flawed , from a constitutional , democratic and legal point of view . 
far from improving the protection of personal information , it in fact threatens it . 
this is why we are asking , and have asked already numerous times , that the federal government withdraw its bill and resume consultation with the provinces in order to table a bill that respects provincial jurisdictions . 
i would take advantage of this debate to remind the Minister of Industry and the hon. members on the government side that my colleague from Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques had made a motion during the 35 th Parliament calling for the government to make Crown agencies subject to the Privacy Act . 
this motion was passed unanimously with the support of all of the Liberal members , including the ministers . 
unfortunately , the government did not follow up on it . 
yet now we have that same government wanting to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction while incapable of first putting its own house in order . 
in light of the federal government ' s refusal to withdraw its bill , the Bloc Quebecois called for modifications in order to have it not apply in Quebec , where personal information is already adequately protected . 
in 1982 , the Government of Quebec passed legislation protecting privacy in the public sector , and Quebec is the only state in North America to have legislation protecting personal information , which it has had since 1994 . 
the Quebec charter of rights and freedoms , which dates from 1975 , stipulates that everyone is entitled to the protection of his or her privacy . 
the Quebec Civil Code also addresses the protection of privacy , placing it within a framework that addresses the fundamental principles governing the gathering , retaining and use of information relating to an individual . 
the two acts to which I just referred complete the Quebec legislative framework by stating the rights , obligations and rules of public and private organizations in the matter of privacy . 
Quebec is obviously a leader regarding the protection of personal information , but this bill could reduce the protection provided to Quebecers . 
indeed , contrary to what one might have expected , Bill C - 6 does not even extend to the private sector the principles governing the protection of personal information in the federal public sector . 
the bill does not go nearly that far . 
let us look at a few flaws in this legislation . 
under the existing act , federal institutions are required to inform individuals that they collect personal information that concern them , and they must also specify how that information will be used . 
under Bill C - 6 , this is merely a recommendation , not a requirement . 
the Quebec act is much more specific and strict , since it provides that any agreement relating to such disclosure or use of personal information must be expressed clearly and freely , and must be given in an informed manner and for a specific purpose . 
thus , it seems that the bill primarily seeks to promote electronic commerce , at the expense of privacy protection in the private sector . 
this is not surprising , since the Minister of Industry has always ignored the part of his mandate that concerns consumer protection . 
moreover , the remedies provided in the bill are time - consuming , costly and ineffective because the federal commissioner cannot issue orders , but can only write reports . 
Canadians will have to go to the federal court to settle disputes , but only after the privacy commissioner will have issued a non - binding opinion , and only after all other recourses will have been exhausted . 
finally , unlike the Quebec act , the bill does not provide for criminal penalties when the principles governing the protection of personal information are breached . 
given all the flaws of Bill C - 6 and the step backward it represents for Quebec , the Bloc Quebecois has presented several amendments aimed at limiting the damage that may result from its overlapping the existing legislation . 
another amendment that we tabled will eliminate the power of the governor in council to unilaterally decide to whom the federal law applies . 
another amendment presented by the Bloc Quebecois aims at maintaining the right to privacy insured to Quebecers by the provincial legislation in their relations with federal businesses operating in Quebec . 
finally , an amendment presented by our party aims at avoiding the establishment of new rules concerning the legal definition of signature and rights to a contract for the electronic sector because these questions fall under the provincial jurisdiction in matters of property and civil rights . 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Quebec government are far from being the only ones in Quebec to oppose the passing of Bill C - 6 . 
they have the support of the Quebec Bar which wrote on February 4 th on the then Bill C - 54 : 
as for the Chambre des notaires , on April 7 , they wrote this : 
we submit that overlapping systems will , in our opinion , cause undue misunderstandings and complications both for consumers and for organizations subjected - We believe an amendment is needed in order to exclude from its application professionals , notaries as well as any person or organization otherwise subjected to Quebec legislation . 
finally , on last March 23 , the Quebec Interprofessional Council , which regroups all 43 professional corporations in Quebec and some 260,000 members , wrote this : 
we believe that Bill C - 54 and the system it is proposing are highly inappropriate within the Quebec context , and we ask you to amend it in order to specify that it does not apply to persons or organizations already subjected to Quebec legislation in that regard . 
in the wake of the 1995 referendum , the Prime Minister presented his motion on distinct society and said that he would take this notion into account when bills were passed . 
on June 2 , the Minister of International Trade stated in an article published in La Presse that : 
canada decided not to eliminate differences , but to base its future on a system of accommodation between majorities and minorities . 
the minister added that Canada did not want a single legal system for everybody . 
therefore I ask the Prime Minister to respect Quebec society and withdraw this bill , which , in its present form , is not acceptable to Quebec . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , it strikes me has a bit odd that a bill dealing with the protection of personal information has already been put under gag order , as we are just beginning . 
here we are in the high forum of debate and democracy , and as soon as we begin it , because our electors have asked for it - 301 members have been elected to this House to speak on behalf of the voters - the Liberal government has the annoying habit of trotting out a gag order immediately , a time allocation order , and put an end to debate . 
we must look very seriously at this strategy . 
this concerns us very much . 
there a lot of things that concern us about parliamentary democracy . 
without revealing caucus secrets , I can say that we wondered about this type of expeditious and often time wasting measure , in which the government says " Into the closet with this debate . 
we have decided to put an end to it at a certain point '' . 
in fact , I recall the Liberals criticizing such proceedings with the Progressive Conservatives , when they were in power . 
today , they are in power and are applying the same principle , if not doing worse . 
there are a lot of other things that bother us too , debates without votes for example . 
i realize that there are what is now called exploratory debates . 
members have a fundamental right , the right to vote . 
instead of asking members to speak and to vote , the government will say " You can speak now for three or four hours , for two days , but there will be no vote following '' . 
the government members ought to support us and criticize these strategies as well . 
without revealing what was said in caucus , I do hope they also had such a discussion . 
it is a fundamental right . 
it is often said that power is entirely centred in the Prime Minister ' s Office . 
here , people learn of the government positions . 
these are fundamental democratic issues . 
today , once again , we saw how the fundamental democratic values of parliamentarians can be violated . 
this is totally disgraceful . 
strange to say , it happened in connection with a bill dealing with the protection of personal information . 
this is a fundamental issue in society . 
people are a bit fed up with their personal information being used and disclosed all over the place . 
this is a major concern of our constituents , and today we have just been told to " Make do with a limited debate on the subject '' . 
this is totally disgraceful . 
i just had to start by condemning this measure by the government . 
i looked at the title . 
the last time , when we debated old Bill C - 54 , there were basic differences between it and the title of the Quebec legislation . 
obviously , the Quebec government aimed mainly at protecting personal information . 
this is slightly different , and I would even call it the antithesis of the title of the federal bill being debated today . 
the title is quite long , but it is also quite revealing . 
right from the beginning , it is clear that the main issue is the promotion of electronic commerce . 
we have very often criticized these priorities . 
if we look at campaign contributions , it is easy to understand why the federal government would want to protect its friends . 
furthermore , it is intruding into Quebec ' s jurisdictions . 
once more , those who make big contributions to campaign funds will get special treatment . 
we do everything we can to keep it like that . 
we go everywhere in the countryside and in the towns and cities to collect $ 5 or $ 10 contributions . 
that way , we are free to speak our mind , as we are doing today . 
we have a perfect example of that today . 
in Quebec , many people have made their position clear on this issue . 
my colleagues have said a few words about that . 
the Quebec bar association , through its president , has taken a very interesting and significant stance . 
it goes like this : 
Quebec ' s system has been in place for almost five years ; it is well known and businesses have made the adjustment . 
accordingly , the Quebec Bar Association supports the basic thrust of this recommendation by the access to information commission . 
here is what the commission says : 
in order to avoid any confusion and so as to ensure that Quebecers continue to enjoy a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information , we submit that bill [ - ] 
today , it is Bill C - 6 , previously Bill C - 54 , 
[ - ] should be amended so as to specifically exclude the federal act from applying to businesses subject to the Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur priv é . 
they go further still : 
furthermore , in our view , the bill should include a reference to Quebec ' s act , even in federal areas of jurisdiction , so as to avoid confusion , overlap and duplication of legislation in Quebec . 
of course , for the minister and for the federal government , which is just as centralizing and paternalistic as ever , what is happening is exactly the opposite , given the sequence of events . 
i will explain what the federal minister understands by advising the provinces . 
on September 21 , two or three months after the meeting , the minister sent the bill in essentially the same form as it is today to the ministers concerned . 
on October 1 , a few days later , he tabled his bill , thus bypassing completely the jurisdiction of each of these provinces , as well as the very explicit jurisdiction of Quebec , where the law has obviously proven its worth . 
there was the Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information , which made a very positive assessment of the Quebec legislation five years after its enactment . 
when a province passes legislation in one of its own areas of jurisdiction , Ottawa always tries to interfere and impose a federal policy coast to coast . 
several members even add the third coast . 
this is another thing that is working fine in Quebec , just like the millennium scholarship fund . 
we have implemented some remarkable practices in Quebec . 
but once again , we have seen how the government operates . 
not only does it not intend to withdraw the bill , but it wants to limit debate on a bill that concerns directly all voters . 
the way the government is dealing not only with Bill C - 54 but with all the issues I mentioned earlier is most disgraceful . 
this is why I join with my colleagues to ask the government to withdraw this bill and let the provinces handle the protection of personal information . 
we are doing just fine in Quebec . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Vancouver East , child care ; the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest , fisheries . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , it is always with sadness that we rise in this House when we feel it is the last time the government will allow us to speak on a given bill . 
first of all , let me say that I too feel it is an outrage . 
i believe the protection of personal and private information in a bill regarding electronic commerce is something that obviously concerns us all because it very deeply affects all Quebecers and Canadians . 
one might wonder whether the government has something to hide . 
i will remind this House that the difficulty in developing a legislation is to identify the problem and to propose a bill that is so clear that it can also be implemented easily . 
first of all , the minister is trying to create dissension because he disregards this first principle . 
some of my colleagues just mentioned that , in the summer of 1998 or at a meeting held in the spring of 1998 , the minister discussed this issue with his colleagues . 
just like a game or electronic commerce that the minister is getting ready to do , he is making things appearing or wandering at his will . 
this could instil fears into people . 
the second point I wish to raise - and members will say that I am a member of the Bloc and that I am always sensitive to this question - is the issue of jurisdiction . 
of course , when the British North America Act was first enacted , the issue of the protection of personal or private information in electronic commerce was surely not a concern in the legislators ' mind . 
however , we must say that Quebec ' s Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector is a good one . 
it is applied in its jurisdiction . 
it is fully in force . 
what I do not understand is that the federal government , by the back door , through its Minister of Industry , wants to pass an act on electronic commerce . 
because the minister is looking for trouble , I must say , if the bill is passed and if he continues to reject all amendments suggested by the Bloc , we will have two different jurisdictions regulating the same thing . 
since everybody knows that electronic data travels very fast , merchants will have to ask themselves if the data they received or collected on a given day on their customers must be dealt with according to the Quebec act or the federal act . 
if they have to transfer data to another province or elsewhere , they will have to clarify the situation before sending it . 
the other issue I want to raise relates to the good faith of the Minister of Industry . 
in the speech he gave when he introduced the bill - I do not remember the date - he said that " Where a province adopts substantially similar legislation , the organizations covered by the provincial legislation will be exempted from the application of the federal law within that jurisdiction . 
Quebec already has privacy legislation similar to the bill entitled Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act , so the province will be exempted from the application of the federal Bill '' . 
the government will have to amend the bill because the present wording does not allow for such an exemption . 
in that definition of the power conferred to the governor in council , organizations and activities are mentioned , but it cannot be used to exempt everything that is done in a particular province . 
we already know that the legislation will have to be changed or amended accordingly . 
in light of the bill ' s flaws , considering that electronic commerce is just beginning and will become much more prevalent in the future , and that this is a sensitive issue for Quebecers and Canadians , why did the minister not accept the Bloc Quebecois ' proposal to withdraw the bill and to go back to the drawing board to harmonize this legislation with the Quebec act while also taking into account the need for legislation in the rest of Canada ? 
it would have been easy for the minister to do that , particularly since the government postponed the beginning of the session . 
it moved up in terms of its number , but not much has moved in the minister ' s head or , I should say , in the department . 
i find it hard to understand . 
perhaps this is what the throne speech was all about : do nothing , introduce old bills as new ones , come up with bills that we did not have time to finish debating during the last parliament . 
one wonders what kind of government we are dealing with . 
madam Speaker , you are indicating that my time is almost up . 
this is unfortunate , because I would have liked to continue . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
order , please . 
i must interrupt the hon. member to tell him that we cannot refer to presence or absence of members . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
madam Speaker , I did not refer to anyone ' s absence , at least I do not believe I did . 
but you will excuse me for being so enthusiastic on a Tuesday night . 
i want to be sure the government is responsible enough to consider the amendments since it refused to take the opportunity it was offered to redraft the bill from scratch . 
the government must stop interfering in areas under provincial jurisdiction , and everything will be fine . 
Mr. Beno î t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I take this opportunity to wish us good luck in this new session . 
like my colleagues , I am pleased , following the excellent work done by the member for Mercier on Bill C - 54 in the previous session , to support the work of my colleague from T é miscamingue , which I am sure will be just as excellent , on this new bill now referred to as Bill C - 6 . 
i listened carefully to my colleagues ' speeches , and a particular remark made by one of my colleagues led me to slightly change my introduction to talk to you about a motion . 
i had forgotten to mention it in my speech . 
i think the motion has been adopted in early 1996 by the government party . 
at the time , we opposed the motion not because of non recognition but because of the pathetic aspect of the motion or its role . 
we have an outright proof of the unfounded grounds and the lack of seriousness of a parliamentary motion when such a serious subject is discussed . 
and the government does not take into account this same motion in the application or analysis of the bill before us . 
my voters were saying " Why did the Bloc Quebecois vote against this motion , since you were being recognized . " 
i gave them an example and please allow me to give you the example I used with my fellow citizens , who , by the way , were laughing a lot , to illustrate the role or importance of a motion . 
i expressed it in the following way : 
when we entered the House of Commons in 1993 , several members had little or no experience . 
we passed two bills . 
in 1994 or 1995 , legislation was passed recognizing hockey as Canada ' s national sport . 
i myself had always thought that was the case , but they had just found it out , so we voted hockey to be the national sport . 
then somebody realized that a group had been left out , and everyone must always be thought of . 
the motion was therefore changed to read that hockey was the national winter sport , and that a summer one would be determined later . 
if people do not know , the summer sport of Canadians is lacrosse . 
that is what the motion passed in this House states . 
a motion is something very important . 
the government had just passed a motion that this was our country ' s national sport . 
they came up with that in 1994 or 1995 . 
i am not familiar with the statistics on participation to this sport , but in my riding I know they are relatively low . 
the people that play this sport are not percentages . 
there are few people practicing this sport . 
the very same year , the budget of the national team was reduced to zero . 
if you want to know what a motion is worth , I have two examples : that of national sport and that of Bill C - 6 . 
in both instances , a motion was passed . 
i think that the Prime Minister does not perhaps recall having voted on it . 
however , we can see the consideration that is accorded a motion when it is time for decisions to be made . 
that said , I return to Bill C - 6 . 
often , in cavalier fashion , the government thinks , when a bill is analyzed , that we are wicked separatists and do so from a separatist standpoint . 
as a result , it covers its ears and does not bother to listen . 
it prefers to read other things , like " Awake '' , perhaps . 
so , in this presentation , I will draw not on a Bloc Quebecois document , but on a document by the Quebec Access to Information Commission . 
even though the word " Quebec " is part of its name , the commission is not dangerous . 
it analyzed Bill C - 54 - now , Bill C - 6 . 
i know that my colleagues have used a lot of documents and committee briefs to present another vision , another aspect of Quebec ' s unanimous objection to this bill . 
i remind members that the title and the intent of the bill are based on the constitutional power of the federal government to establish a climate of trust among Canadians in the way industry gathers , uses and transmits personal information to allow e - commerce to flourish . 
this sector is indeed growing vigorously and must be protected . 
i read on : 
based on Quebec ' s constitutional powers in the area of property and civil rights , Quebec ' s act is meant to complement Quebec ' s Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and its Civil Code . 
Quebec ' s legislation , which includes an act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information , shows how important privacy is to the lawmaker . 
further it says : 
the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector Act does not apply only to commercial activities , but also to personal information likely to be gathered , used or disclosed through electronic means . 
what the Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information explained in its brief was that , on the basis of Quebec ' s constitutional powers , its Civil Code , its values and customs , and also , as my colleagues explained earlier , Quebec ' s experience with an act which has been working well for five years , it was saying no , as we are doing now , to Bill C - 54 , the current Bill C - 6 . 
why ? 
because clauses 4 and 27 ( 2 ) of the bill define the scope of the future federal legislation and provide that organizations or activities might be exempted from federal rules regarding the protection of personal information . 
as the commission understands it , the federal legislation will apply to businesses based in Quebec or to part of their activities , unless an exemption is granted by the governor in council , which is not very likely . 
even if an order was made for a Quebec business operating outside of Quebec , the federal legislation would automatically apply to 28 % of Quebec businesses involved in electronic commerce with other Canadian provinces . 
further on in its submission , the Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information said : 
moreover , several Quebec businesses will certainly be forced to apply both the federal and the provincial legislation at the same time , unless they have no commercial activities or none of the personal information they have is collected , used or disclosed outside Quebec . 
this would limit many Quebec businesses which are open to electronic commerce but would have no contact with businesses outside Quebec . 
it clearly states : 
we have to oppose this proposal because every business in Quebec will have to deal with two jurisdictions , while the Quebec jurisdiction that has been existing for five years is in keeping with the standards of the OECD that were put forward by industrialized countries experimenting with electronic commerce means , even though Quebec has been demonstrating and applying them well for the past five years . 
all witnesses who came before the committee , on which the hon. member for Mercier , who has now been replaced by the member for T é miscamingue , sat , have been able to show this . 
in conclusion , in its submission , the Quebec Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information said : 
to avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers can still enjoy a comprehensive protection of personal information system , the commission submits that Bill C - 54 - 
this is actually Bill C - 6 , which was designated as C - 54 at the time . 
- should be amended to explicitly provide that the federal act will not apply to businesses subject to the act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector . 
i was made to understand , while following the debate on this issue , that this amendment was rejected by the Minister of Industry and by the government . 
that is why we are simply asking for the withdrawal of Bill C - 6 , so we can go back to square one and put in place a more credible legislation . 
Mr. Louis Plamondon ( Bas - Richelieu - Nicolet - B é cancour , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , like my colleagues , I want to condemn the attitude of the government for two reasons . 
first , the government tabled the bill hastily , without even bothering to consult the provinces , to the detriment of the most sacred rights that can exist in Quebec . 
second , having tabled the bill , the government does not even want it to be debated . 
my colleague the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve expressed our dismay and disapproval well when he spoke after the government House leader ' s announcement of the gag order . 
he basically said " Speak for a while and then the legislation will be passed , regardless of how well - articulated or useful your arguments may be to improve the bill '' . 
i have been sitting in this House for more than 15 years now and , after this government took office , I have noticed a loss of what I would call the democratic tradition of this House . 
in fact , I am reading these days a document on the history of the House of Commons , the first debates held in this place and how well , in the early days , the members of the different parties were listening to each other . 
i can say that , when I arrived here in 1984 , the tradition had been upheld . 
amendments proposed by the opposition were often adopted by the government and consensus was often achieved , not always in the House but following a committee process . 
i also remember that the government House leader who imposed the guillotine was part of a threesome called the " rat pack '' . 
these people were hysterics who tore their shirts . 
they even had their acronym stamped on t - shirts that they distributed to people on the street to denounce the then conservative government for having imposed the guillotine on one or two occasions . 
it was unbelievable to see the force and the wisdom with which they defended the principle of the democratic debate in the House . 
these people who were then the guardians of democracy are today its embalmers . 
these members have now become like sheep whereas they were roaring like lions a few years ago . 
the heritage minister also , who was by his side , was proclaiming her indignation . 
there was also a third member , who kept his principles . 
he is sitting today as the independent member for York South - Weston . 
he roared , but when his principles were betrayed , what did he do ? 
he left his party , and voters in his riding re - elected him . 
he is a principled man . 
i do not share entirely his views on everything , but I say that at that time he was shouting on that side , and later on he did not bow down like a sheep , he stood up and crossed the floor . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
he did not knuckle under . 
i wonder what those members came to do here if not only to vote when they are told to do so . 
a little while ago I saw many of them , and I still see some of them , bowing their head . 
they have been forbidden to speak to this bill . 
they are ashamed , and I understand why they are looking down . 
i understand why they are hiding behind the curtains . 
i understand as well why they made signs to their leader when he came in to put the gag on us . 
it is difficult to belong to a party that calls itself democratic and to be told : " Shut up . 
you are not here to think , you are here to vote when you are told to do so . 
we are four or five here to think for you '' . 
however , when they make speeches in their ridings , this is not what I hear . 
they say that they will defend firmly the rights of the individuals , associations , businesses , industries and citizens of their ridings . 
we are speaking of the rights of citizens and what do they do ? 
they do not react . 
they accept to remain silent about a bill that is so important that it impacts on everyone in Quebec and in Canada . 
i appeal to these members . 
i remember some speeches that the hon. member for Beauce made in his riding when he said " I will do the same as Mr. Bernier did before me '' , but Mr. Bernier would have reacted to a bill like this one . 
the hon. member for Beauce should be ashamed of what he said that time . 
if Mr. Bernier were here , he would rise and say " I do not accept that the rights of Quebecers are being trampled on in this way by this bill '' . 
where is the member from Laval - Ouest ? 
during the last electoral campaign , she engaged in debates and spoke constantly about human rights . 
she has not said a word about this bill . 
the hon. member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine is always lecturing us about human rights in Quebec . 
but what is she doing today ? 
and what is the member for Lac - Saint - Louis , a former Minister of the Environment in Quebec and a great human rights advocate doing ? 
he also is keeping silent . 
i call on the member for Pierrefonds - Dollard . 
he is a physician . 
he must know what human rights are , what privacy means . 
but he also is saying nothing . 
i call on the member for Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , a former unionist and president of the CEQ . 
how many times has he talked about human rights in his speeches ? 
i was expecting him to rise and say " No , this bill does not meet the expectations of the citizens of Quebec at all . 
it contradicts everything that was said by all the Quebec agencies who spoke on the subject '' . 
but no , this public defender , this former great unionist now goes along , as his leader is doing , toeing the party line . 
and what of the member for Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , who was saying the same thing during the election campaign ? 
what does the bar association have to say ? 
it says all that . 
however , when he was the president of the bar association , what did he do ? 
the organization that he was heading has told us , and the member for Terrebonne quoted it earlier , that this bill was utterly useless , and that if we really wanted to pass it , it would have to be drastically amended . 
this organization sent a four - page letter to every member of parliament . 
where is the former president of the bar association , now the member for Brome - Missisquoi ? 
he also is remaining silent on this bill . 
then there is the member for Brossard - LaPrairie . 
i heard him in Shawinigan , during the 1993 election campaign , and during the 1992 referendum campaign . 
together , we took part in debates . 
he was a great champion of rights and freedoms . 
today , he is being silenced by his leader . 
five years ago , it was the first region in the western world to introduce such a bill and to enact it . 
i appeal to all the ministers from Quebec , the Minister of Public Works , the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport . 
if he is now off his diet , is he now free to deal with human rights ? 
in concluding , I hope that in the last moments of this debate , all members from Quebec , no matter their political allegiance , will rise to tell the minister " Withdraw your bill '' . 
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague for Bas - Richelieu - Nicolet - B é cancour for his excellent speech . 
he has reminded us that government members have remained quite silent on an issue related to the protection of personal information . 
it is quite something to see that they respect a self - imposed gag order to let a bill be passed , one wonders why , when it has been condemned by just about everybody in Canada and in Quebec , because it will be detrimental to the protection of personal information . 
it is totally unacceptable , and I hope the people who are watching us will take good note of that . 
why do we disagree with this bill ? 
this bill , which will support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information in certain circumstances , was introduced by the industry minister just last week . 
it is identical to Bill C - 54 , which was introduced on October 1 , 1998 . This bill has already been debated . 
we were hoping for some amendments when the minister introduced it again as Bill C - 6 , because it had been so heavily criticized . 
but the minister is coming back with exactly the same bill as Bill C - 54 . 
why do we disagree ? 
because the industry minister has introduced this piece of legislation without any consultation with the provinces or anybody else . 
this bill is an intrusion into provincial jurisdictions . 
it will mean less protection for personal information in Quebec . 
its implementation in Quebec will be a cause for confusion . 
if passed , this bill will be the worse administrative nightmare ever . 
moreover , this bill is legally flawed . 
this bill is not clear enough . 
it does not really help to define the right to privacy or to tell the organizations to which the legislation applies how they should be protecting the people ' s rights '' . 
the Life and Health Insurance Association stated that " other provisions of the legislation are hard to interpret , especially the ones dealing with key issues such as the application and enforcement of the act '' . 
professors from l ' Universit é du Qu é bec à Montr é al stated " If one wishes to truly protect the consumer in an area as formidable as personal information , one must adopt some strict rules and not rules written in the conditional tense that , for all useful purposes , do not obligate a company to show anything more than good faith . 
you cannot expect this to produce that result '' . 
i do not think one can be any clearer than that . 
in Quebec , the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms that was proclaimed in 1975 . 
also , the Quebec government has passed the only act in America to protect personal information in the private sector . 
god knows why the government is disregarding it . 
it is trying to give its bill precedence over Quebec ' s legislation , which is considered as a model all over the world . 
why is the minister ignoring Quebec ' s legislation is a model all over the world ? 
can anyone explain why ? 
the Minister of Industry acted unilaterally despite his promise to consult all the stakeholders before introducing his bill . 
he may have done some minor consulting to make things look good , but he did not take anything said into account and proceeded to introduce his bill . 
as a matter of fact , on June 12 , the ministers responsible for the electronic highway met in Fredericton and decided to consult each other , if necessary , on the advisability of passing legislation protecting personal information in the private sector . 
on September 21 , the federal Minister of Industry sent his provincial counterparts a draft bill and asked for their comments on wanted the federal government wanted to introduce . 
the Minister of Industry is also responsible for creating a constitutional dispute that could have been avoided had he agreed to work in co - operation with his counterparts . 
the provinces have jurisdiction in the area of personal information under the Constitution Act , 1867 , which gives them powers with regard to property and civil law . 
every expert consulted by the Bloc Quebecois recognizes that it is first and foremost a provincial jurisdiction . 
however , Bill C - 6 says that it will apply to organizations under federal jurisdiction in their commercial activities , to organizations that transfer personal information from one province to another or from one country to another , and to employees whose personal information is collected by an organization under federal jurisdiction . 
moreover , clause 30 ( 1 ) says that federal legislation will apply to private organizations , even though they are under provincial jurisdiction , if the federal government does not recognize the existence of similar legislation at the provincial level . 
if that is not interference in areas under provincial jurisdiction , I do not know what words to use to make members understand . 
bill C - 6 will be a big step backwards for Quebecers with regard to the protection of personal information . 
Quebec ' s legislation says , in section 14 , that consent to the disclosure or use of personal information must be evident , free , enlightened and given for a specific purpose . 
with regard to consent , Bill C - 6 puts the consumer at a disadvantage by stating , in various clauses , vague principles that open the door to interpretation . 
unfortunately , I do not have enough time to give a thorough explanation of what is wrong with this bill . 
in closing , I would like to remind members that this bill was introduced without any consultations with the provinces , that it encroaches on provincial jurisdictions and that it represents a step backwards for Quebec with regard to the protection of personal information . 
the enforcement of this legally deficient bill in Quebec will create confusion . 
this bill is impossible to enforce , it is vague , it causes undue difficulties for Quebec businesses and considerably weakens the right of Quebecers to the protection of personal information . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I was going to say that I am rising on Bill C - 54 , but since the House was prorogued by the government leader , we have to redo our homework today . 
we also have to rename this legislation Bill C - 6 . 
in spite of the three and a half months the government had to prepare an appalling Speech from the Throne , it begged for three more weeks , and this of course led to all the bills dying on the order paper ; this is unfortunate since the consideration of these bills was , for the most part , quite advanced in the House . 
bill C - 6 is sponsored by the Minister of Industry , the good member for Ottawa South in the federal capital region . 
when we watch this minister act , we sometimes ask ourselves if his judgment is failing him . 
this is the same minister who , a few weeks ago , said of Quebec ' s minister Bernard Landry that it was stupid of him to have met the mayor of Boisbriand , where GM ' s plant is located . 
he said " Since there is a good dialogue between us , I will help you keep GM ' s plant '' , when everyone knows full well that 95 % of Canadian automobile plants are in Ontario . 
Quebec only has 5 % of them , one out of 15 , and the minister would like to close it down . 
members can see how twisted and dishonest the government is . 
they changed the name of unemployment insurance for employment insurance . 
it means that you pay insurance policy and if your house burns down , the insurance company indemnifies you . 
in the same way , workers pay part of their wages to have protection against unemployment or lay off . 
the hon. member for Drummond knows perfectly well that only 42 % of people who pay employment insurance premiums qualify for benefits when they lose their job . 
why ? 
because eligibility criteria were hardened . 
the minister of Industry tells us that he will protect the privacy of Canadians . 
if he treats the confidentiality of personal data the same way he treats Canadian workers , there are reasons to worry . 
the way he treated Bernard Landry , the vice premier of Quebec , shows that the man does not have an ounce of judgement . 
the minister is so deprived of judgement that he acted unilaterally when he introduced his bill on personal data protection without waiting for the report of the very consultation committee he had created . 
i wonder how a man like him can be member of the cabinet . 
isn ' t that bright ? 
there is even worse . 
on September 21 st 1998 , 13 months ago , he consulted the provincial ministers . 
a few days later , on October 1 , he went ahead and introduced his bill , Bill C - 54 . 
i am not the only one , and the Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to object to the way the minister is behaving . 
in Quebec , his critics are unanimous . 
there is the government of Quebec , the Conseil du patronat , the CSN , the Chambre des notaires , Options consommateurs , the Barreau du Qu é bec - of which the member for Brome - Missisquoi was president . 
he was then president of the Quebec Bar . 
five years later , his former association says : " Bill C - 6 is garbage , it should be thrown out . " 
worse yet , a group of constitutional experts said that Bill C - 6 was in violation of the constitution . 
a little while ago , the member for Drummond said that in 1994 Quebec had passed a bill protecting personal information . 
in Quebec , we already have an act . 
a few years later , the federal government is getting ready to destroy , ruin , put the axe to something which is working well in Quebec . 
we saw the same thing in the throne speech we heard two weeks ago . 
in Quebec we have a drug plan which is working well . 
the federal government now wants to create it own . 
once again it is going to cause trouble in Quebec . 
the Minister of Industry knows full well that in Quebec we have what we call civil law and in the rest of Canada they have common law . 
" every person is the holder of personality rights , such as the right to life 
everyone agrees 
, the right to the inviolability and integrity of his person , and the right to the respect of his name , reputation 
that is , not saying anything against someone 
and privacy '' . 
this is section 3 of the Civil Code and it is from the latest volume that was just published . 
bill C - 6 should be put in file 13 , shelved and simply be cancelled . 
we , in the Bloc Quebecois , want that Bill - 6 be simply withdrawn for a number of reasons . 
first of all , the Minister of Industry has tabled it without consulting the provinces . 
the bill would interfere with provincial jurisdictions . 
finally , it uses electronic commerce as an excuse to invade the civil right of Quebecers and of all Canadians . 
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand ( Qu é bec East , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise after my colleague from Frontenac - M é gantic . 
i hope to be as eloquent as he was on the subject . 
like my other colleagues in the Bloc , I am somewhat perplexed and concerned by Bill C - 6 . 
so , the law covers all areas of personal information , and now we have the federal government with another law , Bill C - 6 , which , in legal terms , is inadequate as it fails to cover all it should . 
in addition , it causes serious confusion in business and does not even protect individuals . 
my colleagues have spoken at length of various aspects of the bill . 
it in fact is known to represent primarily big business in Quebec and has traditionally been federalist in its political views . 
bill C - 6 does not at all take into account the Quebec act , with the result that Quebec businesses will be subjected to two different legal systems . 
in its presentation , the Conseil du patronat says that for information collected , used and transmitted in the province , the personal information protection act that will apply in the private sector will be the Quebec act , while the federal legislation will apply to information transmitted outside the province . 
this is only one of many factors that will generate confusion among businesses . 
the Conseil du patronat provides a few examples . 
for instance , Quebec companies that come under federal jurisdiction and that do business outside Quebec , or that are governed by a Canadian act , will not know which legislation applies . 
indeed , there will be two acts that will put contradictory demands on them and , moreover , that will not adequately protect people . 
there is a jurisdictional conflict , with the result that Quebec consumers will not be properly protected , while businesses will have two types of remedy . 
this is a total contradiction . 
and these are only two examples provided by the Conseil du patronat du Qu é bec . 
consent is extremely important when we are dealing with personal information . 
however , the provisions in bill C - 6 , which is the federal legislation , and in the Quebec act are different . 
under the Quebec legislation , consent must be express , specific and clear . 
on the other hand , according to the principle set out in section 4 , schedule 1 of Bill C - 6 , consent is required . 
there is one contradiction . 
there are others , for instance the one concerning the collection of information . 
the Quebec legislation states that the collection of information from a third party cannot be done without the consent of the individual , except in certain very specific exceptional circumstances . 
bill C - 6 on the other hand states that an organization may collect information without the knowledge and consent of the individual . 
how can anyone see his way clear through two pieces of contradictory legislation that are complete opposites in their vision and their application ? 
it is certain that this does not protect the Quebec consumer but , worse still , it places Quebec businesses in an extremely unfortunate position , because they are incapable of knowing whether they should be treating their customers according to federal or provincial legislation . 
things will be even more complicated for companies carrying on business with out - of - province companies or those coming under federal legislation . 
these are all questions for which we find no answers at this time , and if Bill C - 6 is passed as is , they will mean huge problems for businesses . 
this is one of the conclusions by a council that , I would remind you , is not a sovereignist organization . 
it is one that defends the interests of Quebec business people and often comes across as federalist . 
there are so many questions raised by Bill C - 6 . 
that is , moreover , the reason I am so concerned . 
if the Conseil du patronat raises so many questions on Bill C - 6 , one may well wonder , given the potential conflicts and obvious contradictions , whether this bill is just an unplanned accident or a deliberate act by the federal government . 
does the federal government have the deliberate intention of adversely affecting Quebec with Bill C - 6 , not only in its law - making powers , but also by harming Quebec businesses ? 
does the government deliberately wish to harm Quebec ? 
in the case of Bill C - 6 , we are justified to ask this question because it is big and obvious and because the contradiction is also obvious . 
i wonder if , basically , it could be deliberate . 
there is no lack of recent examples regarding the federal government and its actions against Quebec , whether against the social union or the provincial powers . 
we have seen it in the health sector ; we have also seen it recently in the education sector with the creation of the millennium fund . 
what an insult for Quebec . The only thing that could be worst could probably be Bill C - 6 . 
the federal government directly addresses the students on the issue of the millennium fund and even they are outraged to see how it shamelessly holds them hostage . 
once again , Bill C - 6 is an example . 
bill C - 6 is a good example of this attempt which is probably part of plan B , which is to despise everything that maintains the distinct character of Quebec , that is the privacy legislation for example . 
in conclusion , as all my colleagues , I wish that the minister will finally wake up and have the good sense to withdraw this bill . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , you can understand how happy I am to take part in this debate , first of all because we are back and I missed you a little , assuming that the reverse might somewhat be true . 
i want also to wish a good session to all the pages who are joining us for the year ahead . 
however it is also with some sadness that we have to join in the debate today . 
who in this House could have imagined that the government , whose end of the regime we can already scent , would have the gall to re - introduce a bill that nobody wants ? 
this bill was unanimously rejected in Quebec . 
through you , Madam Speaker , I challenge , not the agriculture minister for at this time he might not be awake , but any other minister to tell us who in Quebec supports a bill like this . 
do you think it has any support in the union community ? 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
do you think it has any support in the human rights community ? 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
do you think it has any support in the legal community ? 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
do you think it has any support in the Quebec government ? 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
and that government is one of the best that has ever graced the national assembly , as everybody knows . 
everyone who saw the bill rejected , and I would even say thoroughly disliked , it . 
but today the government , whose singlemindedness is second to none , presents us with a bill like this . 
at this time , I think it would be appropriate to express just how much we enjoyed the excellent and absolutely eloquent speech by the member for Frontenac - M é gantic . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
madam Speaker , he reminded us that Quebec has had a law since 1994 , in addition to the Civil Code , which you have certainly had occasion to look through in your spare time . 
the member for Berthier - Montcalm , a lawyer himself , who studied in this city not far from the Hill , made the same point . 
he also told me , in confidence , that he has wonderful memories of the years he spent studying law . 
we will stop at article 40 . 
in my view , article 35 is the most important article in the Civil Code when it comes to respect for privacy . 
i will read it , because it captures the essence of what the legislator was trying to say about privacy . 
i will dedicate it to the government members . 
the following acts , in particular , may be considered as invasions of the privacy of a person : one , entering or taking anything in his dwelling ; two , intentionally intercepting or using his private communications ; three , appropriating or using his image or voice while he is in private premises ; four , keeping his private life under observation by any means ; five , using his name , image , likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the public ; six , using his correspondence , manuscripts or other personal documents . 
the Civil Code is not a meaningless document . 
it is not the Liberals ' red book . 
it is the very foundation of our legal system . 
we are , and I have learned this myself in my law courses , a province , a country - soon , let us hope - with a civil law tradition . 
what is the difference between civil law and common law . 
let us say that , in common law , judges can make the law , although this could be harshly debated . 
in our system , legislators and parliamentarians give some direction in a legal system where everything is codified or pass specific legislation . 
we have already passed a specific piece of legislation concerning the right of privacy . 
we led the way , as several of my hon. colleagues pointed out , and we cannot understand why the government is so eager to legislate in this area . 
some people might find it easy to believe that I am too partisan , even though I can ensure everyone today as I have in the past that it is not the case . 
i am talking , of course , about the Quebec Bar Association . 
has there been a more respectable institution in our society , a more neutral one , up until the day the former president of the bar decided to join the Liberal Party ? 
but we like to think this is the exception to the rule . 
i would like to read you something from Page 2 of the document : 
" to avoid any confusion and to ensure that Quebecers continue to enjoy a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information , we submit that bill C - 54 should be amended so as to specifically exclude the federal act from applying to businesses subject to the Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans le secteur priv é , which is a Quebec law . 
we go further still , saying that , in our view , the bill should incorporate Quebec ' s act , even with respect to federal areas of jurisdiction , so as to avoid confusion , overlap and duplication of legislation in Quebec . " 
i do not know if I should table the document so that it will be available to all parliamentarians . 
i am prepared to do so . 
but one thing remains : authorized people of the legal community , the main spokespersons of the lawyers , the president of the bar greatly wished that the Quebec legislation be extended . 
this is a paradox of this government . 
when we read the Speech from the Throne , we expected the government to budge in a number of sectors . 
i could give you the example of the air transportation sector . 
we expected the government to do something . 
remember , there has been a cabinet reshuffle . 
the Prime Minister has recognized that there were quite a few jacks in this government and that he needed some queens . 
he then has called to the cabinet a number of women and we expected the government to do something . 
even you , Madam Speaker , somewhat wished it deep down inside . 
we expected the government to budge in the air transportation sector . 
we expected it to do something in the area of organized crime , on the issue of money laundering , for example . 
so many other areas should have retained the attention of the government ! 
instead of doing something in areas it was mandated to do something , the government intervenes in an area of pure civil rights tradition , thus compromising , as you can understand , the integrity of the powers of the national assembly . 
then , we have no other choice but to oppose this legislation . 
all my colleagues will do so with as much determination as our critic for industry and we will fight this bill until it is withdrawn . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I am very happy to rise on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to speak to Bill C - 6 , formerly Bill C - 54 . 
there are some in the Quebec society and elsewhere who are questioning the role of the Bloc Quebecois here in the House . 
madam Speaker , as a representative of a Quebec riding , this is the perfect demonstration of the role played by the Bloc Quebecois in this House , which is , in addition to promoting sovereignty , to speak up for Quebec ' s interests . 
where are the other members from Quebec ? Where are they ? 
if out of 75 members in this House we had 74 sheep , as was the case for Quebec in those days , what would they be doing faced with a bill on personal information such as Bill C - 6 ? 
it is an obvious intrusion , undue and unbridled , on the part of a minister who is displaying a self - serving attitude we did not think he was capable of . 
as we will recall , he introduced this bill on October 1 st 1998 , only days before the opening of the OECD meeting on electronic commerce in Ottawa . 
the then industry minister , who is the same as today , was hosting the meeting . 
he probably wanted to look good to his international counterparts , pretending he was concerned about the real issues in his area , probably to raise his profile although this was going against public interest . 
there is a consensus in Quebec according to which the federal government should not intervene in the field of personal information , since this issue is quite well covered by Quebec ' s law . 
the bar , through its president , Me Jacques Fournier , wrote on February 14 , to my colleague of Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , and said : 
" first , we are puzzled by the lack of correlation between the title of the act and its contents '' . 
this is what the president of the bar said . 
it is normally embarrassing for the government . 
indeed , the bill has more to do with the protection of personal information in the private sector than with the promotion of electronic commerce . 
yet , the subject of the meeting was electronic commerce . 
but the government wanted to show itself in the best light . 
they are changing words to show themselves in a better light in front of the people . 
the president of the bar continues to denounce the federal project by saying : 
Quebec ' s policy has been applied in Quebec for close to five years now . 
this policy is well known and businesses are accustomed to it '' . 
consequently , Quebec ' s bar essentially subscribes to the recommendation made by the information access commission , and I quote : " In order to prevent all confusion and to ensure that all Quebecers can continue to benefit from a complete policy in matters of personal information protection , we propose that Bill C - 54 be amended by providing explicitly that the federal act will not apply to businesses already subjected to the Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector '' . 
let me continue quoting from the president of the bar : 
we would go even further . 
we think the bill should be incorporated by reference in the Quebec legislation , even in federal areas of jurisdiction , in order to prevent confusion , overlap , and duplication of legislation in Quebec . 
we have been condemning for 40 years this duplication between federal and provincial legislation that makes such a mess in our institutions . 
the president said further : 
we believe the Quebec plan for the protection of personal information in the private sector is better than the one in Bill C - 54 , now Bill C - 6 , particularly as concerns rights of appeal and efficiency . 
the merits of the bill cannot withstand the serious examination made by the president of the bar or the Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information , which has a mandate to speak out , because we are dealing here with personal information . 
however , I have been particularly impressed by what I read from the testimony of the Conseil du patronat . 
this organization is a legitimate advocate for business interests . 
it certainly has more ties with the Council for Canadian Unity than it does with the Parti qu é b é cois executive , for example . 
this organization has written a chapter that is as good as many sovereignist speeches . 
in the brief it submitted to the Standing Committee on Industry , the Conseil du patronat is critical of the communication of information . 
i quote the brief on page 5 : 
because of the double jurisdiction , the companies falling under provincial jurisdiction will wonder whether the personal information which is collected from them and consequently protected by Quebec ' s legislation and which is transmitted to a company falling under federal jurisdiction and carrying business in Quebec will be governed by Quebec ' s rules or Canada ' s rules . 
in addition , within a single file , some information could be subject to both statutes . 
it is easy to manage for someone who is in the private sector , who has to do business , who has to deal with a union , who has orders to fill and deadlines to meet - we know how complicated it is - and who is confronted with such legislation that clearly shows the existence of two solitudes . 
so , along the lines of Reed Scowen , the government is also addressing Canadians . 
maybe the time has come for our country to reflect on where we are all going together . 
it might be better for each to proceed along its own solidly built road running in the same direction , rather than crashing head on and trying to gain the right of way in an area already governed perfectly well by provinces , and Quebec in particular with an entire culture behind it that is suited to this type of problem . 
now to go on with the disclosure of information , again quoting from the brief submitted by the Conseil du patronat : 
what about the organizations whose activities are connected to federal jurisdiction , for instance loan companies and airports ? 
one could even conceive of different rules applying to one and the same file , depending on whether the information collected , used or held is covered by Quebec or federal law . 
this is a constant muddle . 
moreover , any Quebec business with a branch in another province - such as an insurance company - that is required to send it information gathered in Quebec would have to know whether to refer to the Quebec or the federal legislation on protection of that information . 
similarly , if the information in question is stored in a computerized data bank in Quebec but accessible by another company outside Quebec , which legislation would apply ? " 
now , coming to the conclusion of this chapter : 
these are all questions for which we find no answers at this time , and ones that will pose huge problems to businesses if the bill is passed in its present form . 
this then , is what the business people have to say , the language they use , and these are the ones responsible for added value in our society . 
it is no secret that these are natural allies . 
but they are telling the government : " Stop , do not continue with this bill . " 
this is , moreover , the position of the Bloc Quebecois . 
it is an indefensible bill . 
instead of spending his time on such a bill , the minister should be focussing more attention on the GM affair . 
he should quit behaving to the Quebec ministers as if he were an Ontario minister and abandon the scornful tone he uses with Quebec ' s deputy premier and minister of industry and commerce . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
this bill , formerly Bill C - 54 , which was criticized by most of my colleagues , remains a bill that should be treated as the Bloc Quebecois proposes , that is , it should be set aside . 
the Minister of Industry should be sent to do his homework so that everyone is satisfied . 
to this point , one party is totally dissatisfied - Quebec . 
it is unanimous in Quebec . Everyone opposes this bill on e - commerce and personal information . 
why is everyone opposed ? 
first , it is as a matter of principle . 
the federal government has an almost legendary propensity to meddle in jurisdictions other than its own . 
every lead taken by Quebec in areas of its jurisdiction is penalized by the federal government with its wall to wall bills . 
over the years , there have been fairly remarkable examples of this . 
in 1994 , for example , we were all newly elected to our first term , and the Minister of Finance started talking about the appropriateness of establishing a Canadian securities commission . 
securities are under Quebec ' s jurisdiction exclusively , and Quebec has worked very hard for the past 30 years to create an effective system with highly interesting areas of jurisdiction that are in fact higher than what is found in most provinces in Canada . 
the Minister of Finance paid no attention to the problems this might cause Quebec . 
there are other examples , such as that involving provincially chartered insurance companies . 
Quebec had an inspector general of financial institutions , a Commission des valeurs mobili è res to monitor transactions and minimize the risk for shareholders and insured persons . 
however , that did not stop the Minister of Finance from deciding a few years ago to prevent a provincially chartered insurance company from Quebec , L ' Entraide assurances , from acquiring a block of insurance from a federally chartered company . 
the reason given was that it would create a precedent and other provinces would want to follow suit , although they were not prepared to do so . 
once again , with the levels of protection Quebec has introduced in the financial sector generally , and particularly in the insurance sector , we were penalized because the other Canadian provinces did not show the leadership that Quebec did in this area . 
if we go back a little further , we will recall that Bill S - 31 , in the early 1980 s , prevented the Caisse de d é p ô t et de placement from acquiring a large block of shares in Canadian Pacific . 
once again , because Quebec had established an institution like the Caisse de d é p ô t et de placement starting in the 1960 s , which was already a force to be reckoned with in the early 1980 s , because Quebec had taken the lead , had opted for modern methods of managing the pension funds of Quebecers , it was penalized . 
the federal government wanted to stop Quebec from getting ahead , from modernizing . 
the millennium scholarships are the same thing all over again . 
in the case before us , it is the same thing . 
Quebec has had a personal information protection act for five years . 
that act works well , and everyone is familiar with it now , both the consumers , who can invoke its provisions , and businesses . 
legislation must adjust to evolving situations . 
but the Quebec act enjoys the unanimous support of Quebecers . 
this is so true that , as others have said before me , even the Conseil du patronat finds that it is a good act with which businesses can work , and with which they are now familiar , because it has been in effect for five years . 
should Bill C - 6 come into effect , it would create total confusion among Quebec businesses . 
in fact , the Conseil du patronat refers to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec government in the area of personal information protection , as provided by section 92.13 of the British North America Act . 
the Conseil recognizes that Quebec has jurisdiction to legislate in that area . 
it also feels that this bill will create confusion not only among businesses , but also among consumers , who will not know who to turn to , or to which legislation to refer to protect their rights and the information that concerns them . 
in its brief , the Conseil du patronat said " As for Quebec consumers , they would always have to identify which act applies and to choose between two remedies , depending on whether the information is protected under one act or the other '' . 
this bill would create total confusion . 
it has been criticized since it was first introduced as Bill C - 54 . 
it has been criticized by everyone in Quebec and particularly by those who take an interest in personal information protection and in the civil code . 
this proposal was made by the Barreau du Qu é bec . 
it may be worth considering . 
as others have said , it is not that we hate the bill . 
we consider that it could very well be implemented in the nine other provinces but that , in Quebec , the choice made five years ago should be respected . 
this could be one of the flexibilities that people across the way like so much to boast about , particularly after the Speech from the Throne read by the Governor General . 
it seems to me that that could be a good way to prove that the government wants to improve a little bit the functioning of the system . 
it may also be advisable for the government , after six years in office , to show that it can respect the choices made by Quebec and recognize that it was a pioneer . 
since our first day here , we have been asking the federal government to take action in its own jurisdictions . 
for example , it was asked to take action in the transportation industry during the debate on Air Canada , Canadian Airlines and Onex . 
just recently , we saw another example of the federal government refusing to co - operate in the transportation industry with the way Quebec ' s finance minister was treated by the Minister of Industry with regard to the restructuring proposal for the GM plant in Boisbriand . 
it is being asked to fight organized crime , reform our tax system , and give middle income Canadians a substantial tax break as early as this year and this fiscal year . 
but it refuses to take action in these areas . 
it always finds a way to interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction . 
it creates conflicts , and the opposition always finds itself in an awkward position when it would have been so easy for the federal government to say that this bill will apply to the other provinces , with a reference to the Quebec legislation regarding the protection of personal information for that particular province . 
therefore , for all these reasons , we will vote against this bill . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , everybody will understand that it is on a somewhat humble tone that I am speaking today to an issue of such a vital importance , after the many eloquent speeches from my colleagues . 
i am making reference , among others , to the members from St. Hyacinthe - Bagot , Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , Rosemont , Trois - Rivi è res and Frontenac - Megantic . 
all those who rose before me are only adding , if you will , to my nervousness while I am speaking . 
your attention to this debate and your nods of agreement while we speak are only adding to the determination with which I am expressing myself here today . 
we can only go back to the origins of this country , Canada , namely the Constitution Act , 1867 . 
this document - until the fast approaching day when Quebecers will decide to leave democratically , and we are working passionately to that end every day - represents the rules we have to follow . 
the Constitution , although plagued with defects was nevertheless sometimes reflecting a certain wisdom . 
all the colleagues who spoke before me mentioned that section 92.13 of The British North America Act gave the provinces exclusive power on property and civil rights . 
but another paragraph which remained almost unnoticed until now in the Constitution is section 94 . 
this allowed the federal government to standardize legislation in Ontario , Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , but not in Quebec , because it was recognized explicitly , not only in section 92.13 but in section 94 as well , that the legal system in Quebec was distinct , based on a totally different tradition , a civil tradition . 
the recognition of the distinctiveness of Quebec ' s legal tradition is not upheld by those who want to be the heirs of the Fathers of Confederation , the current government . 
any observer from another country , or even one landing here from another planet , would say " My goodness , this does not make any sense . 
the ones defending respect of the Constitution of 1867 are the sovereignists , the ones who want to ensure that Quebec is no longer bound by that document '' . 
where are the defenders of federalism ? 
where are the defenders of the Constitution ? 
even those who come from Quebec did not stand up to say " Wait a minute , we will not allow the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec to be flouted , put aside , forgotten , and even , as one my hon. colleagues put it so eloquently , scorned '' . 
it is of course the Bloc Quebecois ' position that I just mentioned , but it is widely shared by numerous stakeholders throughout Quebec . 
once again , the Bloc Quebecois is the voice of Quebec in the federal arena , to the great displeasure of my colleague from Chicoutimi , whose speech I did not hear . 
i do not know if he rose to speak on this subject . 
an hon. member : 
no , he hasn ' t . 
Mr. Richard Marceau : 
my colleague , the member for Chicoutimi , has not yet been heard . 
i hope that he will rise and , for once , defend the interests of Quebec in the House and that he will do so in a strong voice , with his friends from the Bloc Quebecois . 
i would like to quote Jean - Pierre Bernier , of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association . 
the last time I checked , that association was not exactly a supporter of the Bloc Quebecois . 
Mr. Bernier said : 
there is a constitutional issue here , since personal information , in my opinion , comes under provincial jurisdiction , under the heading " Property and Civil Rights '' . 
therefore , I think it would be very difficult for the federal government to pass legislation dealing exclusively with the protection of personal information . 
if you are able to relate personal information protection rules to an area of activity where federal authority is not in doubt , you have more chances to occupy the field , if I may put it this way . 
this is rather clear , but he is not the only one who thinks so . 
there is also Michel Venne , a well known and respected journalist in Quebec , who works for Le Devoir , the great newspaper founded by Henri Bourassa in 1910 , the motto of which is " Do what you must '' . 
we are doing what we must by opposing this bill . 
he wrote : " The justice ministers of the provinces and the territories expressed strong concerns about significant invasions of provincial and territory jurisdiction found in Bill C - 54 - now Bill C - 6 . 
they asked the federal government to withdraw the bill and to consult the provinces and the territories . 
if the resolution passed in the House of Commons in December 1995 and recognizing Quebec as a distinct society by its language , its culture and its civil code meant anything , Mr. Manley should have provided for an exclusion for Quebec in the original bill '' . 
this is a quote , I am reading it . 
according to the Standing Orders of the House , we may name a minister . 
in Quebec , there is unanimity against the federal bill . 
why is that ? 
because in Quebec , who have been at the forefront of the area for years or even decades , well before we came to this place , the Liberal government of the day , with the support of the Parti qu é b é cois , put in place its own personal data protection system in 1994 . 
that clearly shows that even at that time , the issue escaped partisan politics that is normal in any democratic society . 
however , the bill passed by the National Assembly in 1994 was only one element of the legal interest for privacy protection that already existed in Quebec . 
as was pointed out earlier by my colleague for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , sections 37 to 40 of the Civil Code already cover the protection of privacy and the Civil Code on which is based all the Quebec legal system is not to be swept aside . 
not only that , but another document which has almost a constitutional value in Quebec , that is , the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms , also protects privacy . 
thus , the Charter , which was adopted in 1974 , if I remember well , and the Quebec Civil Code , which has been adopted only recently - we were governed by the Lower Canada Civil Code between 1866 and 1992 or 1993 , if my memory serves me right - all demonstrated how important the protection of privacy was for the Quebec legislator . 
what is this government doing ? 
without any consideration not only for the importance that Quebec had given to the protection of privacy but also for the unanimous opinion of Quebecers of all political colours , it has decided to interfere directly in this area . 
and it is doing it very awkwardly . 
i will conclude by saying that the Bloc Quebecois is asking the federal government to withdraw this bill . 
i hope that Quebec ' s members from the Liberal Party of Canada will request the same thing . 
i hope I will have the opportunity to hear them speaking on this issue .

a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved . 
child CARE 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , what is a national children ' s agenda without a commitment to a national child care program ? 
what is the practicality of a national children ' s agenda without any commitment or target and real program to end the poverty of children and the families they are part of ? 
what really is the national children ' s agenda when there is no sign of federal dollars for meeting the basic needs of housing in our society ? 
these questions are front and centre and remain unanswered after hearing the Prime Minister ' s response to the so - called national children ' s agenda . 
i wanted to get a clear answer and ask the Prime Minister directly if he understands that the so - called children ' s agenda is worthless unless it includes child care , especially as the Liberal government still has not fulfilled its promise for 150,000 child care spaces made way back in 1993 . 
what are the answers to these questions involving the credibility and believability of the national children ' s agenda ? 
all we got were excuses from the Prime Minister saying that the provinces had rejected the offers he made for child care . 
the Prime Minister is dead wrong . 
there is nothing for the provinces to reject because they were not offered any serious initiative that could be characterized as a national strategy and plan for an early childhood development program . 
where are we now ? 
federal New Democrats , the child care advocacy movement , the labour movement and provincial governments that are eager to see the federal government show real leadership want to see the Liberal government get beyond the platitudes of helping kids and get serious now with a national plan for child care . 
Quebec is doing it and B.C. is doing it . 
why is the Liberal government not moving on this ? 
kids cannot wait . 
new Democrats are saying to the federal government that if it is serious about ending poverty , if it is serious about the health and well - being of Canada ' s children , if it truly believes that Canada should be the best place to live for all Canadians , then it should end the vicious attack on Canada ' s poor , start building housing for families who desperately need it , make sure that the child tax benefit goes to all low income families and fulfil its commitments for child care spaces . 
it seems like the Liberals are torn between two paths . 
it is tempted by the lure of tax cuts , peddled by business elites without offering any real help to low and moderate income families . 
while there are others within the Liberal caucus who know that after years of crushing cuts by their own government Canadians have as a first priority a reinvestment in programs and services that will help families . 
i implore the Liberals to not use the provinces as a smokescreen for their own inaction . 
i know B.C. ' s minister responsible for child care , Mr. Moe Sihota , has gone very strongly on the record that he wants a comprehensive national plan for early childhood development and child care . 
please , do not blame the provinces . 
just give us a straight answer . 
will the federal government implement with the provinces a comprehensive national child care program ? 
Ms. Bonnie Brown ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , the Speech from the Throne clearly indicates that children are the highest priority of the government . 
raising the next generation of Canadians is everyone ' s concern and that is why we are doubling the EI period of parental leave . 
that is why early childhood development is a key theme in the national children ' s agenda . 
we recognize that child care and indeed many services for children fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction but we have already made great strides with the provinces to improve the well - being of children . 
the centrepiece of our progress is the national child benefit . 
thanks to the national child benefit , $ 2 billion will be going to modest and low income families with children by July 2000 , bringing total federal assistance for families and children to almost $ 7 billion a year . 
through the NCB , provinces and territories are reinvesting in complementary services for children and eight provinces have already invested in child care . 
the member ' s own province of B.C. has had $ 80 million extra to invest in children , some of which they have chosen to invest in child care . 
we , the Government of Canada , have also acted on our own through the First Nations Inuit child care program which has created or improved more than 7,000 child care spaces . 
through the visions program , we are supporting research projects to improve the quality of child care across the country . 
these initiatives are solid contributions to child care in Canada and the Speech from the Throne provides the potential to do much more . 
fisheries 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , on October 14 I rose in the House and asked a question of the minister of fisheries regarding the east coast lobster crisis in relation to the Donald Marshall supreme court ruling . 
i held the minister ' s record up for review . 
i pointed out the minister ' s record up to now : no moratorium , homes burned , businesses destroyed , neighbour fighting neighbour , 200 years of harmony between natives and non - natives jeopardized and the fear and uncertainty in this free for all continues as it does today . 
i asked the question : 
can we expect more of the same from this minister , no leadership , no plan and no hope of a successful resolution ? 
there has not been a resolution to the problem and there could have been . 
today there still can be , but the leadership is lacking . 
my concern comes from lobster fishermen who are eighth and tenth generation fishermen . 
they remind me that today we have a healthy fishery , a lucrative fishery and a good fishery because it is well managed . 
fishermen exercise good custodial rights , which is what we want to see in this ruling . 
there is no evidence that the minister is going to insist on that . 
for many years there has been a limit on the effort in that fishery . 
that is one of the reasons this fishery has been very healthy and able to sustain many livelihoods over the past number of years . 
that is what the minister has to guarantee those people , that it will be there , that their livelihoods will not be destroyed by mismanagement of the fishery . 
there cannot be a wholesale entry into that fishery . 
they have to have some comfort from the minister as to when that will happen . 
that is part of the solution . 
when our livelihood is threatened we react . 
we understandably react sometimes harshly when we feel as though our way of life is going to be destroyed . 
that is what the non - native fishermen are experiencing at this very moment . 
we want to see leadership from the federal minister . 
at some point , when this is all laid to rest , the word compensation has to enter the equation . 
if we have a fishery with no limit on the number of entrants , in other words allowing new players into that fishery , the entire fishery will be threatened . 
that is what I see happening . 
i think everyone on this side of the House can see that happening unless the minister takes strong , decisive action . 
perhaps I could ask for another 30 seconds . 
i do not want to see the minister continually abdicate his responsibility - 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
i must interrupt the hon. member . 
as he knows , the rules are very strict for the adjournment debate . 
Mr. Lawrence D . O ' Brien ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I thank the House for this opportunity to address an important matter in Atlantic Canada which concerns everyone in this country . 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has taken decisive action on his short term plan as well as a long term plan that all parties will consider fair and reasonable . 
Mr. James Mackenzie has been appointed as the chief federal representative to work out practical arrangements on access to fisheries resources that reflect the affirmed treaty right and that are sensitive to the interests of those who rely on the fishery for their livelihood . 
Mr. Mackenzie has an intimate knowledge of the maritimes and of the importance of the fishery , being from Cape Breton , Nova Scotia , and he has been the lead federal negotiator in comprehensive claim negotiations with the Inuit in my riding of Labrador . 
i have every confidence that Mr. Mackenzie can find common ground on which we can build long term strategies that will be enduring and successful . 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans met with both commercial representatives and with aboriginal leaders in the maritimes . 
he met yesterday , along with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Mr. Mackenzie , with 50 aboriginal leaders . 
coming out of that meeting there was agreement to address fish access immediately and there was agreement on certain elements of a process . 
many more conversations will have to take place but we are moving in the right direction . 
there are no easy answers but I have confidence that there is a long term solution and that constructive dialogue is the way of shaping it . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
( the House adjourned at 7.15 p.m. )

CANADIAN FARMERS 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in September I held several meetings in my riding of Peace River . 
the majority of those attending were farmers who are extremely concerned about what is happening to their industry . 
they told me of how they were proud to have chosen the noble task of providing food for Canadians and for people from other countries in the world . 
they told me of the devastation caused by 20 years of stagnation in farm income and the devastation caused by escalating input costs . 
they asked if anyone in Canada cares if they survive or if they must accept the fate of bankruptcy and retraining for some other job at the age of 60 . 
they are afraid that governments are not concerned about their fate or the fate of the entire sector of agriculture .

NUNAVUT LEGISLATURE 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday I had the honour of attending the opening ceremonies of the Nunavut legislature in Iqaluit and addressing the members of the legislature . 
the importance of this day was recognized by many provincial governments from coast to coast , as well as the NWT and the Yukon , who had representatives attend the official opening of the Nunavut legislative assembly . 
as the members of the legislative assembly start their third session they are happy to be in the newly completed legislative assembly chamber which reflects many aspects of the unique culture of Nunavut , including the seal skin seats in the chamber . 
the members of the Nunavut legislature have exciting times ahead , facing important issues and challenges on behalf of their electorate .

county OF OXFORD INTEGRATED NETWORK 
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday evening I attended industry ' s seventh annual salute to excellence in the management of information and technology in the public sector . 
i was there to support representatives of the County of Oxford Integrated Network , known as COIN , which was nominated for an award . 
to my great delight , COIN was awarded the gold medal in the building partnerships and alliances category . 
this award recognizes COIN ' s efforts on behalf of its partners within Oxford County to provide services to our citizens through technological advances . 
in winning , COIN was selected over nominees from the RCMP , HRDC , the National Research Council and other federal departments . 
i congratulate all of those involved in COIN , especially Oxford County Warden Mark Harrison , County Librarian Sam Coghlan , COIN Manager John Moore , and Oxford ' s HRDC Manager Ed St. Gelais I applaud them all on a job well done .

nuclear TEST BAN TREATY 
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there has been a global outpouring of concern and disappointment regarding the American Senate ' s rejection of the comprehensive test ban treaty on nuclear weapons . 
the abandonment of American leadership on the issue of nuclear non - proliferation is a distressing development in the already challenging struggle to achieve a universal commitment to non - proliferation . 
the American Senate ' s abdication of its crucial global leadership role undermines international efforts to persuade Russia , China and other nuclear powers to ratify the treaty . 
the disappointment which has been expressed by America ' s allies and rivals alike is a testament to the importance of the leadership role which the United States must take on this issue . 
international support for this treaty remains strong . 
as Canadians , our efforts must be concentrated on encouraging the eventual adoption of the treaty by the United States . 
we must also convince our American neighbours that international peace and security are not served by a new form of U.S. isolationism .

VIMY RIDGE 
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , while the sky rained shells and brave men died , 100,000 Canadians moved forth in a hell of inhumanity , testing their mettle and mortality of soul . 
they advanced on unconquerable Vimy Ridge . 
on that same ridge tens of thousands had died before in vain British and French assaults . 
the goal - now Canada ' s turn . 
canada ' s finest young men won the contest that day , a victory for all the world to see . 
the greatest victory of World War I , Vimy Ridge , would enter Canadian history on April 12 , 1917 . 
many would say that Canada took birth that day , born into the world of nations with respect , born by the blood of our young , born through their determination and skill . 
the spirit lives on to this day . 
it lives on in the name and scholastic pursuits of l ' Acad é mie Vimy Ridge in Edmonton .

YWCA WEEK WITHOUT VIOLENCE 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , from October 17 to 23 , the Young Women ' s Christian Association is celebrating the YWCA Week Without Violence 
despite all the progress that has been made and all the battles that have been won by women in the last one hundred years , we are still finishing this century on an ambiguous note . 
the statistics are very eloquent : one girl in five abused by a boyfriend , one woman in three a victim of spousal violence at least once in her lifetime . 
a lot still needs to be done . 
in light of these statistics , which are unworthy of the next century , I call upon the hon. members of this House to reaffirm their disapproval of this situation . 
i call upon them to support the organizations in their ridings that are involved in fighting these crimes , such as shelters for battered women . 
this behaviour will become unacceptable to society only when it is universally condemned .

rail TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Monday in Thetford Mines there was a demonstration by several hundred people from Thetford Mines and Beauce in support of restoration of Qu é bec Central train service between L é vis and Sherbrooke , via Beauce . 
almost all the economic and political stakeholders in our region support this project . 
many jobs depend on it . 
if the branch line is restored , Prolab promises an investment of $ 48 million , which would create 75 direct jobs in our area . 
yet on two occasions the federal government has refused to support putting this line back in service . 
the government must stop turning a deaf ear , and must provide financial support for restoration of the Qu é bec Central train . 
i invite it to lend an ear to this heartfelt cry from the people of this area , and those representing them . 
what is the Secretary of State responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec waiting for before he acts ?

YWCA WEEK WITHOUT VIOLENCE 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the week of October 17 to 23 has been selected as the fourth annual YWCA Week Without Violence . 
this violence free week challenges all Canadians to come up with solutions to control violence in their community . 
thanks to the ongoing support of Clarica - formerly the Mutual Group - the YWCA Week Without Violence will reach tens of thousands of Canadians . 
violence of one sort or another has affected every one of us , or at least someone we know . 
violence is found everywhere : in our homes , in our schools , at work and at play . 
the YWCA Week Without Violence has become an international initiative organized by more than 30 countries worldwide , including Canada . 
i wholeheartedly support this initiative and I urge all members of the House , indeed all Canadians , to do their part in stemming the flow of - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Battlefords - Lloydminster . 
* * * 
CANADIAN FARMERS 
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) : 
the Liberal government has the dubious reputation of throwing taxpayers ' money at a problem . 
what happens if that money misses the target ? 
the agriculture minister continues to stand in the House and say that farmers are saved by his disastrous AIDA program . 
what he fails to mention is that fully three - quarters of Saskatchewan farmers , the ones most in need , have not qualified for any money . 
in Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar the Reform candidate , Jim McAllister , who will soon be joining us here , has raised the issue of escalating farm foreclosures . 
the sad reality is that over 1,000 Saskatchewan farmers are faced with losing their land base over the next year . 
what is the minister ' s response ? 
his best advice to farmers in peril is to quit and look to the government to retrain them . 
there is a growing consensus among Saskatchewan farmers that they would best be served by the minister if he followed his own advice and resigned today .

du VALLON SCHOOL 
Mr. Mark Assad ( Gatineau , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in Gatineau , a group of parent volunteers and the staff of the Du Vallon school have come up with a plan to make the schoolyard more natural . 
the school is asking for $ 15 from each parent sponsoring a tree to cover the cost of its planting . 
on Saturday , Oct . 16 , teachers , students and parents from the school spent the day planting trees - a total of 120 new trees and bushes - in the schoolyard . 
i would like to pay tribute to the work done by students , parents and staff of the Du Vallon school in the hopes that this sort of project may be repeated in other schools in Quebec and in Canada . 
* * * 
national CO - OP WEEK 
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is National Co - op Week and , as the NDP spokesperson for co - operatives and credit unions , it is my pleasure to congratulate them on their successes over the past year . 
marketing , economic and consumer co - operatives have always played a vital role in our economy . 
Rochdale Boulevard , where my riding office is located , is named after the founders of the co - op movement in North America , the Rochdale pioneers , whose principles were first developed in 1844 . 
in this globalized economy we now live in , co - ops and credit unions give individuals and communities the opportunity to take control of their own lives and their own futures . 
with assets of over $ 167 billion , 15 million members and 151,000 employees , co - ops make a significant contribution to our national economy , but they can do more . 
for example , as the supply of affordable housing is disappearing , thanks to the Liberals , and homelessness is reaching epidemic levels we should be looking to co - op housing as part of the solution . 
the federal government should make it its co - op week project to restore funding to co - op housing . 
* * * 
national CO - OP WEEK 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to National Co - op Week , which is being held between October 17 and 23 , and to recognize the important economic and social role co - operatives and credit unions play in many communities in Canada . 
i would like to be parochial for a moment and particularly pay tribute to co - operatives in Manitoba , such as Credit Union Central of Manitoba , Federal Co - operatives Ltd. and Agricore . 
agricultural co - operatives play a major role in Canadian economy : in grains , oilseeds , dairy , poultry and eggs , livestock , fruits and vegetables . 
co - operatives are the grouping of people around a shared objective and operate not for profit but for the economic benefit of their members . 
they promote initiatives from the grassroots rather than from governments . 
whether it is in agriculture , financial services , insurance or housing , co - operatives are growing , adapting and changing to help shape a better world for all of us .

QUEBEC MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Vaudreuil - Soulanges , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the separatists obviously keep shooting themselves in the foot these days . 
this morning , we learned that the Quebec Minister of Finance now feels that outright independence is old fashioned . 
he just discovered that the Parti Quebecois ' option is outdated . 
this is some discovery . 
that same finance minister served under Jacques Parizeau , someone who pulled no punches when stating that Quebec ' s separation from the rest of Canada was something necessary . 
Bernard Landry also tried to downplay the polls indicating that separatism is on the wane . 
in light of these developments , sovereignists should quickly hold another convention to find out if everyone is aiming in the same direction . 
* * * 
breast CANCER 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today , Les Voix du Ruban rose are celebrating breast cancer day in Canada . 
this non - profit organization is run exclusively by volunteers , which reduces management costs to a minimum and makes it possible to allocate most of the money collected to fighting breast cancer . 
les Voix du Ruban rose delegates the responsibility of distributing research funds to a group of people dedicated to that cause , several of whom know the disease not only from a professional standpoint , but also from direct or indirect personal experience . 
the organization Les Voix du Ruban rose is well aware that breast cancer does not discriminate and can strike anyone . 
it is with unwavering determination that it is moving forward and pursuing its efforts to gradually eliminate this form of cancer . 
the organization provides vital support and comfort , as well as a voice to all the women who have to fight that disease . 
let us give generously during its fundraising campaign . 
* * * 
the LATE ALLAN LEAL 
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Allan Leal , who died in Toronto on October 12 , 1999 , had a distinguished career as a legal educator and civil servant . 
he had been named as a Rhodes scholar but because of military service never took up the appointment . 
he took his legal education at the Osgoode Hall Law School after the war , with a later degree from Harvard Law School . 
his deanship at Osgoode Hall came during the public controversy over the role of the legal profession in legal education . 
as the dispute came to a head , he proposed a union of the Osgoode Hall and University of Toronto law schools . 
this was not to be . 
instead , there emerged two separate university law schools with their own distinctive personalities and philosophies of legal education . 
the intellectual legal differences between the two schools have done much to shape Canadian jurisprudence today . 
* * * 
breast CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month . 
today breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Canadian women . 
directly or indirectly , breast cancer affects us all . 
we all have a mother , a sister , an aunt , a daughter or a friend who has been struck by this devastating disease . 
nonetheless , we must recognize that much progress has been made in combating this disease and that more and more women are breast cancer survivors . 
i urge all members of the House to wear their pink ribbons in support of the thousands of Canadian families affected by breast cancer . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
pay EQUITY 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in 1978 the Trudeau government adopted the flawed concept of basing pay for civil servants on arbitrary assignments of value by bureaucrats and politicians . 
it misnamed it pay equity . 
now the courts have said that the government has to pay $ 5 billion to correct the shoddy application of this flawed concept , and it is the taxpayers who are on the hook for the $ 5 billion . 
i ask the Prime Minister where the equity and fairness are in that ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this has now been debated in many courts . 
the judgment rendered yesterday will be studied by the Department of Justice . 
after a review of the judgment , the government will make a decision when it knows all the possibilities . 
equal pay for equal work is a concept we accept . 
i am very pleased to note that Reform is opposed to it . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we support the concept of equal pay for equal work but not the assignment of arbitrary values by politicians and bureaucrats . 
the reality of all of this is that instead of millions of Canadian workers getting a pay increase this year because of a tax cut , these workers can now kiss that pay increase goodbye because of a $ 5 billion bungle by the government . 
why should millions of workers forgo a pay increase to pay for a $ 5 billion bungle by the government ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , just to be clear , is the Prime Minister then saying that the government will make this $ 5 billion payment to correct this bungling and give all the tax relief it was going to give in the first place ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the leader of the Reform Party should know that we have been very responsible in administrating the affairs of the nation . 
we managed to balance the books faster than we predicted . 
sometimes we have expenditures that are not forecast , but we have still managed to balance the books , have new programs and make tax cuts , as we said we would do in our political program for the 1997 election when the Leader of the Opposition was elected as well . 
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board . 
why is each taxpayer stuck with a $ 343 bill to pay for the government ' s bungling ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the concept of equal pay for work of equal value is a human right that the Reform Party members do not know . 
it is a social concept that they do not accept . 
we accept that concept and will carefully look at the judgment to respect the principle of that concept . 
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberal government says it supports the principle of pay equity . 
it was a Liberal government which wrote the law . 
it was this Prime Minister who promised to pay on the basis of equity . 
it was this government that failed taxpayers by refusing to define the meaning of equal value . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our first step is to look at the judgment that we will receive from the federal court . 
we have to study it because the impact of it on our public service is really important .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the RCMP investigation between 1995 and 1997 into the government ' s film subsidy programs contained allegations to the effect that there were serious shortcomings in the way the programs were run . 
the attorney general refused to lay any charges . 
was the Minister of Canadian Heritage aware of the very serious allegations contained in the investigation report ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the allegations I know of are the ones that Bloc Quebecois members have repeated three times now . 
that is precisely why I have called for an RCMP investigation . 
if the member has information other than allegations , I urge him to contact the RCMP . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a bit surprising that the minister is suggesting that she did not know about the results of the investigation conducted between 1995 and 1997 . 
we shall take the minister ' s word . 
now that she knows about the allegations raised by the Bloc Quebecois - and it is a good thing that we did raise them - has she ordered Telefilm Canada to clean up the administration of funding for audiovisual works ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for three days now , Bloc Quebecois members have been making allegations . 
i repeat : if they have any information to share , they should get in touch with the RCMP . 
in case they do not have the RCMP ' s telephone number , I have it here . 
it is 993 - 7267 . 
i invite them to make the call . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , in the latest episode of the series " In the Kingdom of the Cronies '' , the minister stated that an investigation was necessary and that was why she had asked the RCMP to become involved in this new investigation . 
what explanation does the Minister of Canadian Heritage have , since the attorney general considered there was no reason to lay charges in 1997 , for the fact that she now finds every reason to justify a second investigation into the same matter , and what has led to the government to change its position now ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if I remember rightly , last week the member from the Bloc Quebecois made allegations , and it is as the result of these allegations that I asked to the RCMP to investigate . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister ' s red herrings are very revealing . 
did the decision by the attorney general not to act on the investigation in 1997 , a decision that was given a month before have the general elections were called , not suit her government to a T ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , very serious allegations are still being made . 
i invite the member , if he has allegations or information , to pass this information directly on to the RCMP , which is doing an investigation because of these allegations . 
pay EQUITY 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday the government celebrated Person ' s Day to honour the long struggle for women ' s equality . 
on Tuesday the courts condemned the government for denying women ' s equality by denying pay equity . 
the government has a choice , to honour the Prime Minister ' s commitment to pay equity or to continue to deny women equal treatment . 
which is it going to be ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
the problem is that there is no agreement on the amount of money that should be paid . 
the previous president of the treasury board offered a substantial amount of money but the union rejected it . 
the court has now made a judgment which , as I just said , the government recognizes in principle . 
what we need to know is how much money has to be paid ? 
a course of action will be determined after we have studied the judgment . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister insists that the government needs more time to study the judgment . 
maybe it needs speed reading courses because Judge Evans ' decision is crystal clear . 
he said , " This matter has dragged on for far too long and at far too great a cost for all concerned '' . 
for the good of civil servants , taxpayers and all working women , when is the government going to keep its commitment and settle the pay equity issue ? 
right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said , we have already tried to settle that but there was no agreement on the amount of money , not on the principle that compensation should be paid ; otherwise the government would have made no offer at all . 
after we have a chance to study the judgment , we will be in a position to appreciate what our real obligations are and how to implement the judgment if we decide not to appeal it . 
* * * 
competition BUREAU 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a nice simple question for the Minister of Transport . 
in order to protect all consumers , will all the proposals for the restructuring of the aviation industry be required to go through the Competition Bureau merger review process ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , all of the proposals that have come forward are applicable to section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act . 
the Competition Bureau certainly has a role . 
it will be issuing its report within a matter of days . 
the report will be made public and will help guide the hon. member and everyone else on this important issue . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I need a little clarification from the Minister of Industry responsible for the Competition Bureau . 
would the Minister of Industry clarify that ? 
is the website information right or is the Minister of Transport right ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
obviously , Mr. Speaker , the role of the Competition Bureau is to ensure that the Canadian economy retains , as much as possible , a competitive nature . 
that is in fact the best way of ensuring that prices remain low . 
* * * 
pay EQUITY 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is completely confused on the pay equity issue . 
it has no concept of what real pay equity means . 
does the Prime Minister agree with the President of the Treasury Board that this bizarre concept of pay equity " is actually a human right unable to be denied '' . 
is that really your position ? 
the Speaker : 
colleagues , all questions should be addressed through the Chair . 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I repeat , equal pay for work of equal value is the basic principle here . 
i know that the Reform Party does not recognize this . 
it was in its electoral platform that it would scrap that principle . 
the Liberals believe in that principle . 
that is why that judgment is so important . 
we will now take the time to study it very closely . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is the most bizarre answer I have heard since I have got here . 
the government is fighting in the courts the whole concept of equal pay . 
every day its members stand in the House and defend why they cannot give the payout to workers in the union . 
if the minister believes so strongly that this is right , why are they fighting it in the courts ? 
why are they not paying it out ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do understand why the hon. member speaks about being bizarre . 
it is because we are speaking here about a human rights issue and that is why perhaps he does not know about it . 
it is a question of human rights and that is why it is so important . 
the problem that we have is not on the principle but on the methodology . 
that is why it is so important to look at it very closely to understand the impact . 
as a responsible government we will act when we have all the information we need . 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the decision on pay equity is clear . 
it comes down hard on the government for using stalling tactics solely for the purpose of avoiding the obligation to settle with its employees . 
does the President of Treasury Board commit today to abandoning immediately any plans to appeal the decision ? 
does she not consider that the employees , women employees specifically , have suffered enough from the government ' s behaviour in this matter ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I acknowledge that public servants are hoping for a rapid conclusion to this matter , because there have been discussions on it between ourselves and our union partners for some years now . 
we have just received a very important decision , as we wished clarification of section 11 of the act , and now with this decision we have it . 
i believe it is totally normal for a responsible government to take a few days to examine the decision before taking a position , and I can assure our friends the public servants that this is what we will be doing . 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is utterly unbelievable . 
it is the fourth time the decision has been in favour of the workers . 
the President of Treasury Board keeps on saying that she and her government are in agreement with the principle of pay equity . 
if the minister wants to prove without a doubt that she supports the principle of pay equity , why does she hesitate to apply the judgment in its entirety ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I repeat , this government has committed to respecting the principle of pay equity . 
the proof of this is that we have already made payments to the union partners in connection with pay equity . 
what put us on opposite sides of the question was the methodology per se . 
* * * 
immigration 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , bogus refugees have gone missing . 
at least 56 of the 600 migrants have either abandoned their claims or have been denied refugee status . 
no doubt , however , the people smugglers who brought them here know exactly where they are . 
why is the minister allowing organized crime to profit from her lack of action ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is absolutely inaccurate and wrong in his contention . 
it is utter nonsense . 
i want to tell him that it is not the policy of the government to detain all failed refugee claimants . 
the sudden arrival on the B.C. coast this summer posed new challenges . 
we have been making the argument successfully to detain the people in boats two , three and four . 
those people who arrived in the first boat were not detained after we had identified them . 
we experienced a problem and because of the information we had we were able to make the case for boats two , three and four . 
what they are proposing is undemocratic . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , everything in the minister ' s answer was really irrelevant . 
it is clear to Canadians that this system is not working well at all . 
it has been over three months and the government system has completed six claims . 
over 50 people are missing and more are being released every day . 
of course we know that they will disappear . 
i want to know why the minister is allowing people who came here illegally and have been denied refugee status to be released on Canadian soil . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member opposite is proposing that the state have the power to detain individuals when it has no evidence that those individuals will in fact flee . 
we detain them and we have the right to detain if we do not know who they are . 
until we have their identity we have the right to detain if we are concerned about criminality . 
we have the right to detain if there are concerns of flight . 
the individuals the member referred to had shown up for all their hearings as part of the due process . 
i would say to him that unless there is evidence and we can make the case to detain it is not appropriate that we should do so .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today , the Air Canada Pilots Association filed a complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency regarding the agreement linking American Airlines and Canadian International Airlines , and more specifically the provision providing that the American carrier has a veto over any major decision , including takeovers or mergers affecting Canadian International Airlines . 
this basically means that American Airlines has a veto over any possible agreement between Air Canada and Canadian International Airlines . 
does the Minister of Transport really believe that this arrangement complies with the National Transportation Act , which provides that foreign interests cannot in effect control more than 25 % of an air carrier ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the issue raised this morning by the pilots falls completely within the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency . 
i will not comment on the process , because it is not my responsibility to do so . 
it is up to the courts to deal with this issue . 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport have kept repeating for 10 days that they are setting five or six conditions , depending on who is talking , for any merger or takeover in the air transportation sector . 
how can we believe that the government will ensure that its conditions are strictly followed , since the minister is not even prepared to ensure that the existing act is complied with ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said yesterday , we have set five principles for the restructuring of our air transportation system , but there is one principle , which is very important and which is non - negotiable as far as the government is concerned , and that is the application of the Official Languages Act , which is important for all Canadians .

immigration 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , of the 600 Chinese migrants who arrived by boat this summer only six of them have been processed so far . 
it is hardly breakneck speed . 
the minister just basically admitted that these people were rejected as refugees . 
we know that . 
they were then set totally scot - free . 
the minister seems to think that unless they just come forward and admit that they will run away she will not detain them at all . 
why is the minister releasing bogus refugees here on Canadian soil ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , while I will not discuss individual cases I will tell the member that the individuals she was referring to who have been part of the accelerated process , which was part of the IRB decision , were not in detention prior to their hearings . 
because they were entitled to a judicial review before the federal court , there was no reason to assume that they would not continue to meet their obligations . 
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is fine if they are not detained beforehand , but if they are deemed bogus refugees perhaps it would be wise to detain them after . 
the minister does not have a sweet clue where these people are . 
it is impossible for anyone to try to understand the logic behind a system that releases migrants after the hearing regardless of whatever it was that hearing determined . 
due process should not mean disappearance instead of deportation . 
why will the minister not stop this little game of catch and release ? 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to be very clear . 
unlike the Reform Party , we are not attempting to throw out compassionate and humanitarian traditions . 
we will not rip up our charter of rights and freedoms . 
we will not walk away from our international obligations . 
we offer people due process . 
the individuals she is referring to had the right to a judicial review with the federal court . 
it is not the policy of the government to detain all failed refugee claimants before they have received due process .

fisheries 
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp é - Î les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again today , we cannot help but note that , since the Marshall decision , the fisheries minister has been running in circles . 
however , when he took over the portfolio , he said that , whether it was counting pennies or fish , it amounted to the same thing . 
they want to negotiate directly between themselves . 
when will the minister stop behaving like a spectator in this matter and take a clear stance that might resolve the conflict ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Friday I announced in the House the appointment of the federal representative , Mr. Mackenzie . 
his appointment was welcomed by all the groups as a very important step . 
i have all the confidence in Mr. Mackenzie . 
i think he will do an excellent job . 
he is out there talking to the parties right now . Let us let him do his job . 
* * * 
culture 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
Canadians want our government to protect their cultural identity and to preserve global cultural diversity . 
both the foreign affairs and heritage committees have recommended strong international action to achieve this goal . 
what steps is the government taking to implement these important recommendations ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
i would like to thank all of the members of this House , both sides of it , who worked on it , because yesterday , Cabinet decided unanimously that we would continue with a new international instrument to recognize cultural diversity because of the work of these members of the House . 
* * * 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
the information commissioner ' s report to me stated that this practice is not consistent with the Privacy Act . 
why is the Minister of National Defence singling out members of parliament and members of the media and putting his interests above the interest of the privacy of all Canadians ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated yesterday that is absolutely wrong . 
first and foremost I want the laws , whether they are privacy or access to information laws , to be fully complied with by the Department of National Defence . 
i issued a very clear instruction back on April 6 to that effect . 
the privacy commissioner in his report yesterday indicated that had been done . 
also yesterday the privacy commissioner indicated in his report that great progress had been made with respect to the Department of National Defence answering these very matters and ensuring that we abide by the law . 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the information commissioner says he is still monitoring the minister ' s office . 
in a letter to the deputy minister on April 6 , and again yesterday in the House of Commons , the minister confirmed that the preparation of his talking points for his briefing book is more important than the privacy of all Canadians . 
the information commissioner has said that singling out members of parliament and journalists gives the appearance of political influence and bias . 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member does not seem to understand any of the answers he gets . 
i have said quite clearly that following the law and the regulations is first and foremost . 
i said at the same time that this information goes out I would like to know about it so that I can respond to questions from hon. members in the House , or the media or the public . 
i think that is fair , that we would be able to be fully accountable and I am fully accountable for what happens in my department .

royal CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the solicitor general . 
two constituents of mine who were recently bilked out of $ 700,000 in a stock market swindle recently received a letter from the RCMP saying , " You have a valid complaint but sorry , we don ' t have enough money to continue with our investigation '' . 
as the minister responsible for the RCMP , if the police are saying that they are unable to enforce our laws , what action is the minister taking and what advice does he have for my two constituents ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this government is well aware of the funding problem with the RCMP . 
that is why the treasury board conducted a review in co - operation with the RCMP . 
i can also tell my hon. colleague that had he listened to the Speech from the Throne , he would have also heard that this government is even further committed to supporting the RCMP and law enforcement agencies across the country . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister has just said that this a great day for swindlers , crooks , thieves and con artists . 
it is open season . 
when the police admit that they lack the financial resources to enforce our laws , what signal does this send to criminals ? 
swindle the public and if they are caught , nothing will happen . 
if that is the best answer the solicitor general can give to resolve this problem , perhaps he should step aside and let someone else come in and do the job decently . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , unless I am mistaken , my hon. colleague has a hearing problem . 
that is not what I said at all . 
i said that this government is committed to the RCMP and law enforcement across the country . 
i said that had he listened to the Speech from the Throne , he would understand how committed the government is .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , now that all the players in the airline industry affair have put their cards on the table , and so that consumers in this country do not become the real victims of this war for the skies , will the Minister of Industry promise not to extend the suspension deadline so that the Competition Bureau can do its work and protect the interests of Canadians ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our use of a section 47 order in council was a success . 
shareholders now have a number of proposals to consider . 
we will consider the facts when it becomes necessary to do so , in other words at the end of the 90 - day period . 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
it is time this government put individual citizens back at the centre of the decision - making process in all its undertakings . 
will November 9 mark the end of the suspension , at which time the Competition Bureau can resume its function and study the matter fully ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member may think the Competition Bureau does not have a role to play . 
that is not the case . 
* * * 
pensions 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton - Springdale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
can the minister explain why the old age security benefit has been increased only slightly despite a rise in the consumer price index ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , under the old age security program , benefits are indexed quarterly against the CPI . 
there is a slight delay between any increases in the CPI and the changes to the old age security benefits . 
i can assure the hon. member that the August and September increases in the CPI will be reflected in the January 2000 cheques . 
* * * 
aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Indian affairs minister has said that the impact of the Marshall decision extends to other resources . 
he said , " Treaties are obviously an opportunity to share resources '' . 
the 1760 treaty imposed restrictions on the Mi ' kmaq ' s right to trade . 
it even required that they provide hostages as a guarantee that they would live up to the terms of the treaty , a treaty which did not mention fish or access to any other resources . 
the Marshall decision cries out for clarification . 
why will the minister not join the West Nova Fishermen ' s Coalition in seeking clarification of this confusing decision ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member would read the supreme court judgment , he would see it clearly says that there is treaty right for fishing , gathering and hunting . 
that is pretty clear in that judgment . 
it also says this treaty right is a regulated right and not an unfettered right . 
certainly we are working with all the groups to make sure that we have a resolution that we can all live with . 
that is why we have a federal representative working with all the groups at this time . 
* * * 
organized CRIME 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the president of the Canadian Police Association sounded an alarm , criticizing the lack of resources for conducting the necessary investigations into death threats against parliamentarians and private citizens . 
the Government of Quebec , for its part , has increased the resources available to fight organized crime . 
what does the minister intend to do about the glaring lack of resources for fighting organized crime ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe I just responded to that question . 
the treasury board conducted a review . 
this government is fully aware of the funding problem . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
why can the government not be clear with Canadians on this question ? 
my question is for the industry minister . 
is he going to extend section 47 beyond the 90 days ? 
yes or no ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the order under section 47 is in effect . 
the question of whether it would be renewed or extended is premature . 
* * * 
international DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as a result of the economic downturn of the early 1990 s , Canada ' s contribution to international development assistance declined to below our traditional level of contribution . 
as a result of the better economic situation now , can the minister assure the House of her commitment to increase Canada ' s contribution to international development assistance ? 
Mr. Eug è ne Bellemare ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for 50 years Canada has contributed substantially by progress to the improvement of living conditions in developing countries . 
the government remains committed to international aid . 
it pledged that it would be increasing international development assistance as stated in the Speech from the Throne . 
there is always more to be done in developing countries and the government is committed to doing more . 
* * * 
DEVCO 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this Liberal government has wreaked havoc on Cape Breton miners and their children , including Billy Martin of Glace Bay who has worked for Devco for 26 years and will not qualify for a pension . 
i want the minister to tell them what this government is going to do for them and all the other children whose parents will not get a pension from this government . 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in addition to the human resources package announced at the time of the announcement of the Phalen mine closure , we also indicated that there were two other equally important components in the package . 
one was the attempt to privatize the Prince mine with the objective of maintaining up to 500 jobs in the coal mining business on Cape Breton Island . 
the other was $ 68 million for an economic development fund to find a new and more viable economic future for the people of Cape Breton . 
* * * 
aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Marshall decision of the supreme court leaves little but confusion in its wake . 
who the decision applies to and the place of currently licensed fishermen and non - status natives in the new fishery are much open to question . 
the minister suggests they negotiate compromises to settle these issues , but rejects outright that non - status natives are covered by the treaty . 
does the possibility the courts could make non - status natives have access to treaty rights influence the government ' s negotiating decisions today ? 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I answer in my capacity as the federal interlocutor for Metis and off reserve Indians . 
the supreme court judgment in the Marshall case was not totally precise in defining exactly who all the potential beneficiaries of the historic treaties would be . 
* * * 
genetically ALTERED FOODS 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since 1994 the government has had in its possession several surveys carried out on its behalf indicating that 80 % to 95 % of Canadians support or demand the labelling of genetically altered foods . 
surveys by other organizations have confirmed this . 
my question is for the Minister of Agriculture . 
why does the minister continue to ignore the clear wishes of the public and refuse to provide it with accurate labelling information on genetically altered foods ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the hon. member that just three or four weeks ago the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors as well as the Standards Council of Canada , the Consumers ' Association of Canada , processors and producers began work on a set of criteria that could be used for the labelling of genetically modified food in Canada . 
* * * 
persons WITH DISABILITIES 
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we learned yesterday that the provincial government in Nova Scotia stopped a $ 700,000 program to improve access to public buildings for persons with disabilities . 
this coincides with news federally that the request for a permanent subcommittee on the status of persons with disabilities has been turned down . 
in light of the draconian cuts by the Nova Scotia government , we need strong federal leadership more than ever to ensure the rights of the disabled . 
without a committee to deal exclusively with the critical issues of the disabled , how can the minister assure us that these issues will not go right back to where they were before , and that is at the bottom of the heap ? 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , questions about how committees are structured in the House are handled by House leaders at House leaders meetings that are held every week . 
the hon. member knows that and she should raise it with her own House leader . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in Air Canada ' s press release , Air Canada says that it can only go ahead with its proposed airline merger if the Government of Canada has determined that it will abandon its dual airline policy . 
my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
does the Government of Canada have a dual airline policy ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows that we are going through the very difficult process of assessing the needs of the airline industry . 
we have put in motion a process that has brought forward private sector solutions . 
those solutions or a solution coming from the shareholders will be submitted to government to apply the public interest test against those principles . 
i invite the hon. member to come on Tuesday when I speak to the committee so that we can discuss this matter more fully . 
* * * 
youth EMPLOYMENT 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Secretary of State for Children and Youth . 
as chair of the Prime Minister ' s task force on youth entrepreneurship I had the opportunity to travel across the country to speak with young Canadians on business opportunities and employment opportunities . 
could the minister tell us what the business and employment prospects are for Canada ' s youth ? 
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his work on this issue . 
the employment prospects for Canada ' s youth look very good . 
in 1998 we had the highest record increase for youth employment with 2.1 million working . 
in 1999 it increased again by 173,000 young people with new jobs . 
since 1997 , 14,000 , 74,000 and 171,000 have been employed . 
over 85 % of Youth Service Canada and 88 % of youth entrepreneurship participants are either employed , self - employed or have returned to school six to twelve months after completing their projects . 
that is positive .

points OF ORDER 
question PERIOD 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
during question period the member for Dartmouth raised a question in respect of her concerns about policy with regard to the disabled . 
after referring to her disappointment that a certain committee was not set up to deal exclusively with the disabled , she then went on to ask a question of the government , presumably of the minister in charge of the disabled , as to how the minister would look after the concerns of the disabled in the absence of the committee she thought should be struck . 
the government House leader then rose and contended that the question was out of order . 
there are two things here . 
the government House leader should not have been rising in the first place because the question was not about committee business . 
however he contended , while he was on his feet , that it would have been out of order for the member to have asked the question , which is the question she did not ask . 
he maintained that it would have been out of order had she asked about the restructuring of committees . 
i contend - 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
there are two points here . 
first , when a question is asked it is not asked of a minister but is asked of the government . 
therefore anyone on the government side who wants to answer the question may do so . 
second , I know that all hon. members will realize that it is sometimes my prerogative to say what is in order and what is out of order . 
when the House leader says it is out of order , he is out of order . 
when the complainant says it is out of order , he is out of order . 
i am in order and we are going to get on with the business of the House .

government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS

interparliamentary DELEGATIONS 
Mr. Joe Comuzzi ( Thunder Bay - Superior North , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to present the 40 th annual report of a meeting of the Canada - United States Interparliamentary Group which took place in Quebec City from May 20 to 24 . 
i would just like to explain some of the topics at this very important function . 
it was a success , not only because of the venue of Quebec City but also because it drew the largest contingent available from our colleagues in the United States . 
there were 27 congresspersons and senators there from the United States Congress . 
this is the largest group of United States legislators ever to attend a meeting outside their particular jurisdiction . 
i am pleased to report - 
the Speaker : 
i know the hon. member is getting to the punch line but he is not going to give us the whole report , I hope . 
i know the member will finish up right now . 
Mr. Joe Comuzzi : 
with those words of support , Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to submit the report in both official languages . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since Canada does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan , I seek unanimous consent of the House to table a report on behalf of the Canada - Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group . 
the Speaker : 
the House has heard the suggestion of the hon. member . 
is it agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on August 1 to 7 , a delegation of Canadian parliamentarians visited Taiwan to meet with Taiwanese President Lee Teng - Hui , as well as to visit with officials of the government and business executives doing business in Taiwan . 
the Canada - Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group has circulated this report to all members for their comments and input . 
we are very pleased to comment in our report on the status of Taiwanese relations with mainland China , on Canada - Taiwan relations and on matters of economic and cultural exchange .

marine CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 8 , an act respecting marine conservation areas . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
the Speaker : 
the Chair is satisfied that this bill is in the same form as Bill C - 48 was at the time of prorogation of the first session of the 36 th Parliament . 
consequently , pursuant to order adopted Thursday , October 14 , 1999 , the bill is deemed to have been read the second time , referred to a committee , considered in that committee and reported ( with amendment ) . 
( bill deemed read the second time , considered in committee and reported ( with amendment ))

national AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY RELIEF CO - ORDINATION ACT 
Mr. Speaker , you have very briefly identified the subject matter of the bill . 
we have some difficulties in the safety net programs that have been developed by government thus far . 
this piece of legislation would legislate a committee made up of all the stakeholder . 
the provinces and the federal government would then be able to come to the House to table those reports and propose legislation that would deal with natural disasters in agriculture , as well as other extraordinary circumstances , particularly like we are suffering today in agriculture . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

young OFFENDERS ACT 
i drafted and presented the bill during the last parliament , many months before the justice minister introduced a youth justice act . 
my bill makes the protection of society the first and guiding principle of the criminal law as it pertains to youth . 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
Mr. Speaker , the bill is on the suggestion of the Canadian Police Commission that is asking for assistance in dealing with those convicts who steal a car and use the vehicle in the commission of a crime . 
it is asking that this be given special consideration which would involve consecutive sentencing for that crime . 
consecutive sentencing is a very unusual word to the Liberal government , but I am sure it will understand the meaning of this document . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
criminal CODE 
they are asking for the ability to arrest , without warrant and at the time of wrongdoing , any person who is visibly seen violating parole or probation . 
this bill would enable them to do that . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
* * * 
employment INSURANCE ACT 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 256 , an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act , 1999 ( qualifying for benefits ) . 
it proposes , among other measures , to correct two inequities affecting newcomers on the labour market , young people and those who return to the labour market after two years absence , namely women who stay at home to raise their children . 
these people must work 910 hours , compared to other workers who must work between 420 and 700 hours , depending on the regional rate . 
this creates two categories of unemployed . 
the bill also seeks to eliminate the two categories of unemployed created by the current legislation , namely those who worked 700 hours and those who worked less than 700 hours . 
it is impossible for those who have worked less than 700 hours to obtain parental leave or sick leave . 
this bill is the same as Bill C - 298 , which I introduced in the House of Commons on December 8 , 1997 . 
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i am seeking the consent of the House to introduce a bill regarding Louis Riel . 
it is essentially the same bill that was referred to as Bill C - 417 in the last session . 
the Speaker : 
does the House give unanimous consent for the request of the hon. member ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed .

LOUIS RIEL ACT

automotive POLLUTION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac - Saint - Louis , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 258 , an act to protect human health and the environment by reducing automotive pollution . 
therefore , I reintroduce it . 
the purpose of this bill is to protect human health and the environment against certain types of harmful or potentially harmful automotive fuel and to reduce automotive pollution in Canada . 
the bill would enact a provision requiring that no person shall produce or import for use or sale in Canada or sell or offer for sale in Canada any gasoline that has an oxygen content less than 2.7 % in weight , any diesel fuel that has an oxygen content less than 5.25 % in weight , or any gasoline that contains MMT .

Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to present a petition that has been certified correct as to form and content . 
petitioners from the Grand Bend , Lucan and Strathroy areas have signed the said petition . 
the petition states that the use of the additive MMT in Canadian gasoline presents an environmental problem affecting every man , woman and child in Canada . 
the petitioners call upon parliament to set by the end of this calendar year national clean fuel standards for gasoline with zero MMT and low sulphur content . 
the SENATE 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition signed by a number of people from Saskatchewan which states that the Senate of Canada is undemocratic , unelected and unaccountable , that it costs the taxpayers some $ 50 million per year , and that the Senate undermines the work of the elected members of parliament who sit in the House of Commons . 
therefore the petitioners are calling upon us to begin measures aimed at the abolition of the Senate . 
it is a good idea . 
the CONSTITUTION 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition signed by 70 individuals from my riding of Vancouver Island North .

agriculture 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to present today to the House under Standing Order 36 . 
the petitions are signed by residents of Saskatchewan . 
the first petition concerns the inability of the AIDA program to provide services to agriculture . 
it suggests that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food should be replaced with an individual who has a better understanding of how agriculture is being affected today and how agriculture should be affected in the future . 
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition contains 82 pages of signatures from residents of Saskatchewan who have asked me to present their petition to the House of Commons . 
the petition concerns the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board . 
the petitioners say that the federal minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board has failed to meet not only with farmers , but business people and concerned citizens in his constituency , and has failed to protect the true needs of Canadian agriculture . 
they too wish to have the minister replaced with an individual from the government side who better understands the issues not only of agriculture , but of the Canadian Wheat Board . 
i would like to file these petitions on behalf of the petitioners . 
the CONSTITUTION 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am proud to rise today to table a petition on behalf of my constituents . 
the petition contains over 1,500 signatures from the residents of Guelph - Wellington and the surrounding area .

justice 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to table today . 
it is my pleasure to table the first petition from people of Okanagan - Shuswap asking for sweeping changes to the justice system to provide stiffer penalties for dangerous sex offenders , pedophiles and other violent offenders . 
they also request measures so that violent criminals serve their full sentences and that authorities be given more power to get information they need for a conviction , including blood and saliva samples , the elimination of defence on the grounds of insanity , drunkenness or drug impairment , and that the death penalty be reinstated for first degree murder where there is no doubt of guilt . 
bill C - 309 
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is also from the people of Okanagan - Shuswap asking for the rejection of Bill C - 309 . 
this is cited as equal treatment for persons cohabiting in a relationship similar to a conjugal relationship . 
the petition states that the strength of any society is largely dependent upon a solid family unit headed by a father and a mother living in a heterosexual relationship . 
the rejection of Bill C - 309 will help protect the definition of marriage in Canada .

report STAGE 
the House resumed from October 19 , consideration of Bill C - 6 , an act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act , as reported ( with amendement ) from the committee ; and of motions in Group No. 1 . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , let me first say that I deplore the attitude of this government , which is imposing today , in only the second week of a new session , a double gag order regarding the bill on electronic commerce and personal information protection . 
i was wrong . 
it was not enough for the industry minister to see that Quebec as a whole stands united in its rejection of this bill , he is now denying us the opportunity to explain again what we thought he had not understood correctly . 
we were hoping to have a few more days to re - iterate the arguments we had already presented , perhaps stating them more simply this time so that he could understand them . 
we had hoped we could change the course of this bill , but today , with this gag order being imposed on us barely two weeks into the new session , I must face the fact that the industry minister is giving the shaft to Quebecers . 
i must point out that , last Saturday evening , while I was on an open - line show with listeners in the Vancouver area , one caller said that it might prove beneficial , in a number of issues , if other provinces joined Quebec in its protest against the involvement of the federal government in fields under provincial jurisdiction . 
i told the caller that this had been tried on numerous occasions and that , unfortunately , we had always been disappointed . 
i must say that today is one more example of the insensitivity , lack of concern , and arrogance of the federal Liberal government when it comes to Quebecers . 
already in the early 1990 s , Quebec had put the necessary money into researching , seeking input about and drafting a bill that is held up throughout the world as a model of what legislation to protect personal information in the private sector should look like . 
but , rather than turning to Quebec ' s act for inspiration , the minister decided to put together a new one completely from scratch . 
this bill in no way meets personal information protection requirements . 
as proof , because time is running out very quickly , I will recall to the House a number of eloquent statements we heard in committee that should have caught the attention of the minister , who is obviously either poorly informed by his officials or not listening to what we have to say , or perhaps both . 
it is a surprising attempt by the feds to enact legislation in an area where it is highly unlikely that they have jurisdiction . 
the federal government can enact legislation on matters of federal jurisdiction , but not on matters of provincial jurisdiction . 
that was Saskatchewan ' s Privacy Commissioner McLeod speaking . 
the Conseil du patronat du Qu é bec also made similar comments on constitutionality . 
to quote what they said to us at one of the sessions of the industry committee : 
given the constitutional jurisdiction assigned to the provinces by section 92.13 of the British North America Act relating to the protection of personal information and privacy , and the fact that the Quebec legislator has already passed legislation in this area , there is no doubt that a large number of jurisdiction conflicts will arise . 
in other words , the Conseil du patronat is very much aware that the lawyers will be putting a lot of overtime into trying to get to the bottom of it , now that the federal government is trying to get into an area that falls under Quebec jurisdiction . 
in the end , the odds are pretty good that Quebec will win out over the federal government , unless for some reason the supreme court does not come out on the same side once again . 
the area of application of the legislation was also the subject of a number of concerns expressed by the committee . 
we should point out that no federal company has challenged the Quebec legislation , but if the bill we have before us is passed in its present form , that will change . 
the Canadian Bankers Association confirmed , in fact , in its appearance before the Industry Committee , that the banks would in future come under the federal legislation alone . 
what will be the reaction of Quebec consumers when such legislation takes effect ? 
there will then be two systems in place in Quebec , one that protects people properly , and one that protects them far less well . 
the banks will be among the groups of companies covered by the second regime , and will protect individuals ' information less well . 
this bill does not make any sense , and I will show you a fundamental difference between the act currently in effect in Quebec and the legislation proposed by the Minister of Industry . 
consent that is not given in accordance with the first paragraph is null and void . 
the proposed federal act states that " Organizations shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of the purposes for which the information will be used '' . 
what does " reasonable effort " mean ? 
this is a joke . 
it also states that " The form of the consent sought by the organization my vary , depending upon the circumstances and the type of information '' . 
i submit that one better not to say anything than say such platitudes . 
it states further that " In obtaining consent , the reasonable expectations of the individual are also relevant '' . 
this is all Chinese to me . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , fisheries . 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C - 6 and the motions in Group No. 1 . 
bill C - 6 will have exemptions for private sector activities regulated by provinces that have already adopted legislation essentially similar to the federal act protecting personal information . 
the federal act , when it applies to Quebec and the other provinces , will affect federally regulated businesses - notably telephone companies , banks , airlines and interprovincial carriers - as well as all interprovincial and international personal data exchanges for business purposes . 
this is very important , because Quebec ' s act does not protect personal information about me when I do business with a company outside the province of Quebec , or with a company that transfers personal information about me outside Quebec for business purposes . 
the federal act will complete the protection given by Quebec ' s act to consumers of that province , and I am one of them . 
these acts will apply to different activities , and the federal act will fill the gaps still existing in the coverage of the Quebec act . 
in Quebec , the federal act will affect situations where the activities of an organization are not regulated by the access to information commission . 
that relates among others to federal businesses not regulated by the Quebec act , and to the privacy protection problems experienced by Quebecers dealing with businesses outside their province . 
bill C - 6 resolves problems and situations that simply cannot be handled by provincial legislation , regardless of how carefully it was drafted . 
for example , given that data moves easily across the borders of the 13 provinces and territories , the privacy commissioner is in the best position to investigate transborder problems and resolve them . 
a second example will be that of a business with its head office in Alberta , which gathers information on consumers in Quebec . 
neither province is subject to the authority of the other , a federal system is necessary . 
Quebec businesses transferring personal information within the province and from one province to another will have no difficulty complying with the both sets of laws . 
we could identify a number of situations in which a company in one province must act comply with two legal systems . 
bill C - 6 and Quebec ' s Bill 68 are perhaps drafted differently , but their spirit and their effect are quite similar . 
the two laws require the companies to obtain the approval of the individual before gathering , using or disclosing personal information on him . 
both give the individual access to personal information on him when it is kept by organizations in the private sector . 
both laws contain provisions concerning surveillance as ensured by the privacy commissioner and mechanisms of recourse for individuals who have been adversely affected or believe they have been adversely affected . 
but , most importantly , the rights and obligations set out in the two laws are essentially the same , because they have the same starting point , namely the guidelines established by the OECD in 1980 . 
naturally , there are differences , but only because of the fact that the two laws achieve similar ends by different means . 
if I want to go to the Ottawa from Montreal , I can take a number of routes . 
what counts is : do I reach my destination ? 
once Bill C - 6 has been passed , Quebecers will have the best protected private life in Canada , since they live in the only province that has passed legislation to protect personal information in the private sector . 
my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the House go on and on ad infinitum about how Bill C - 6 is such a terrible bill and about how Quebec ' s Bill 68 is such a great bill . 
i am a Quebecer and I am quite pleased the federal government has decided to adopt legislation that will protect my private life and my personal information when it leaves the province . 
right now I do not have that protection under Bill 68 . 
yes , Bill 68 has a disposition concerning the transfer of information , but if I attempt to sue a company outside of Quebec that received my personal information , I will be thrown out of court . 
the first thing that will be said is that the provincial legislation does not apply to a company that exercises its activities outside the province . 
as a Quebecer I am very pleased that my government has decided to protect the personal lives and the private information of Quebecers , all Quebecers regardless of their political stripe . 
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I speak on Bill C - 6 , the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act . 
the government is trying two years later to make new things out of its old 1997 stuff . 
once again , the government lacks imagination . 
however , it certainly is not short on imagination when it wants to interfere in Quebec ' s areas of jurisdiction . 
last spring and also for the last few days , the Bloc Quebecois has expressed its opposition to Bill C - 6 . 
during the fight led by my hon. colleague from Mercier , I had the opportunity to speak two times . 
all Quebecers had asked that Bill C - 54 not apply in their province . 
the Parti Quebecois government , along with the Conseil du Patronat , the Quebec Bar Association , the CSN , the Chambre des notaires , and Option Consommateurs , had asked that the bill be withdrawn . 
Quebecers unanimously requested that the bill not apply in Quebec to avoid confusion and to promote the development of electronic commerce . 
it is not complicated . 
if the government really wanted what is best for Quebecers , it would withdraw the bill . 
i will give a few reasons . 
first of all - and this is the federal Liberals ' trademark - the Minister of Industry introduced it without consulting the provinces . 
it is legally flawed , and it uses electronic commerce as an excuse to make an incursion into civil law . 
these six major arguments that should convince the federal Minister of Industry to withdraw this bill . 
before my colleagues even had a chance to express their opposition , before several of my colleagues even had the opportunity to present their arguments , the government House leader , true to form , with the support of his colleagues , decided once again to bring forward a time allocation motion to curtail debate . 
however , many Liberal members who chair committees have systematically leaked information to the media . 
confidential reports have been disclosed in the newspapers even before being tabled in the House of Commons . 
the federal government has no respect for democracy . 
it is high time parliamentarians from all parties addressed this problem . 
what are the Liberal members opposite doing to defend Quebec with regard to Bill C - 6 ? 
nothing . 
they are silent on this issue , as they are on the Onex proposal , even though 5,000 jobs are threatened . 
they have nothing to say on the issue of hepatitis C victims , on the issue of employment insurance and on the issue of pay equity . 
the members from Quebec are keeping their mouths shut . 
you can go on centralizing and doing what you want . 
all this is revolting . 
it is revolting to realize that , generation after generation , throughout the 1970 s , 1980 s and 1990 s , the federal Liberal government has kept to the same party line . 
between 1968 and 1984 , with the exception of the brief reign of the Progressive Conservatives under Joe Clark , and from 1993 to the present , Liberal members have never broken the silence imposed on them , particularly when it comes to defending Quebec ' s interests . 
fortunately , the Bloc Quebecois is there to defend those interests . 
that is the Bloc Quebecois ' raison d 'ê tre , and I am proud to be a member of this team of men and women who are fighting for Quebec . 
so , as a good Liberal member , and a good minister from Ontario , the federal Minister of Industry therefore acted unilaterally and tabled his bill on personal information and electronic commerce without waiting for the results of the consultation he himself initiated . 
i give you two examples . 
on June 12 , 1998 , at a meeting in Fredericton , the ministers responsible for the information highway agreed , and I quote from the press release given out after the meeting : 
- to consult with each other , when appropriate , when considering the advisability of legislating the protection of personal information in the private sector . 
on September 21 , 1998 the federal Minister of Industry forwarded a copy of proposed legislation to his provincial counterparts , asking for their comments on a bill the government was getting ready to table . 
but there was no follow - up . 
i repeat that this government is doing everything it can to interfere in areas that are Quebec ' s jurisdiction alone . 
the bill introduced by the Minister of Industry to protect personal information and electronic commerce was obviously long awaited , but the result was a big disappointment . 
in conclusion , on behalf of Quebecers and all stakeholders in Quebec who have in turn spoken out against Bill C - 54 , now Bill C - 6 , we are again asking the federal government to show , just once in this legislation , just once in this Parliament , that it is listening to Quebec and to Quebecers , and to withdraw Bill C - 6 .

" ( 2 ) The Governor in Council may , by order , provide that this Part is binding on any agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada to which the Privacy Act does not apply . " 
motion No. 50 
that Bill C - 6 be amended by deleting Clause 29 . 
motion No. 51 
that Bill C - 6 , in Clause 29 , be amended by replacing lines 30 to 32 on page 19 with the following : 
Mr. Speaker , we have now come to Group No. 2 of motions in amendments to Bill C - 6 , which replaces former Bill C - 54 . 
first , I would like to say how sorry I am that the government has imposed closure on this extremely important bill . 
as we were about to embark on very important discussions on the group of amendments before us , the government decided it had had enough . 
it did not want to hear about it any more . 
even though the bill is full of holes , duplicates jurisdictions and creates huge application problems in Quebec , the government decided yesterday , by means of a time allocation motion , which we voted on earlier , that there would be essentially no debate on it and that it would not be debated here any more in the coming days . 
however , this bill is of great concern . 
some of the motions we are currently debating come from the government . 
specifically , they are Motions Nos. 15 and 16 , which refer to a very large elastic to permit the government to be excluded from the application of the bill . 
i will explain . 
originally , the bill provided that there could be exceptions to the protection of personal information , for bodies investigating offences , for example . 
these people would not be required to comply with the law on personal privacy . 
during consideration in committee , this became much broader , going from exempting the people doing the investigations to exempting people investigating activities suspected of posing a threat to Canada ' s security . 
at this stage , the committee decided on a much broader definition of possible exemptions with respect to personal information . 
yet this is a bill that should promote the protection of personal information . 
now , the government is starting to broaden the definition of possible exceptions . 
after consideration in committee , and after the witnesses had been heard from , the government came up with other amendments . 
it is important that this be understood . 
these are amendments which witnesses who appeared before the committee were not given an opportunity to comment on . 
the exemptions to the application of this legislation are still being extended . 
as if by chance , the exemption is being further stretched to take in federal institutions or subdivisions thereof . 
this would mean that now they could be exempted from protecting personal information when they request it for three reasons : national defence , the conduct of foreign affairs , and national security . 
when there is a suspicion , not when there is an infraction , but when there is a suspicion . 
who is going to define suspicion ? 
so , federally regulated companies governed by this legislation , such as a communications company , or CSIS , or just anybody can announce one day that they want information . 
they request this information from one of these businesses , and it should provide information on e - mail sent , for example that relating to other businesses in the transportation field such as private shipping companies . 
the federal government could require a private company to provide a list of deliveries made , where they were made , and what kind of item was sent . 
who is going to define what suspicion is ? 
who is going to define what national security is ? 
this bill had a definition that was very restrictive to begin with , and has now become too broad . 
just as we happen to be about to begin discussing these provisions , here comes another gag order to stop us from doing so , to limit the time we will have for discussion , to ensure that the bill is pushed through , while there are still very legitimate concerns on the table which the government ought to respond to . 
it is all very fine to say that there was a parliamentary committee , but the last series of amendments came along after the committee hearing stage . 
the witnesses did not , therefore , have access to these amendments when they came to testify . 
> i am convinced that a number of groups have reservations , and a number of individuals have fears as well . 
i listened to the Liberal member who said a while ago that now she would feel better protected . 
in Quebec , I lived under legislation that was already in place on the protection of personal information . 
now there is duplicate federal legislation , except that it is full of loopholes and flaws , which might tempt the government to try some political manoeuvring with the provisions in its legislation . 
that is extremely worrisome . 
for infractions , reasonable grounds are required , while for national security a mere suspicion would suffice . 
CSIS tried to infiltrate the Reform Party because it was deemed a threat to national security . 
where is that going to stop ? 
i would think Quebec sovereignists have good reasons to believe this bill could lead to considerable abuse . 
for example , if my riding association transfers information to the national headquarters of our party and sends the membership list through a company like Bell or Sympatico e - mail , this information could become available . 
if they want to get it , they will have access to it . 
the organization or individual concerned would not even know . 
they would not be informed . 
but that is not all . 
if an individual thinks some federal organization is looking for information on him or her and asks a private company whether it has transferred personal information to that organization , the authorization of the person who has requested the information from the company before giving an answer to that individual . 
let me go back to my example . 
i then ask the company whether it has given any information to CSIS . 
the answer I would get is that they have to get an authorization from CSIS before they can give me that information . 
that is quite something when one realizes this is a bill that should protect personal information . 
we should take another look at this '' . 
several of the Bloc Quebecois amendments included in the group that we are debating seek to confirm the primacy of the Quebec law in that area . 
the federal government could easily decide that in a province - namely Quebec - where legislation protecting personal information already exists , it applies and even federally regulated businesses are subject to it . 
this is what the Quebec bar association proposed in its brief . 
it said that , rather than do the opposite and come up with its own legislation to intrude into provincial jurisdictions , the federal government should recognize what already exists in Quebec and ensure that the provincial legislation also applies to federally regulated businesses . 
that would solve the problem . 
but instead , the government is driven by a desire to be more involved , to have more control , to have its own legislation , always for noble reasons , such as the fact that no such legislation exists outside Quebec . 
this is not Quebecers ' fault . 
our legislation is one of the few , in fact the only one in North America , currently in effect . 
if the other provinces take five years to react , it certainly is not our fault and we do not have to pay for it . 
this provincial jurisdiction was already being exercised by one government that had decided to legislate . 
as far as I know , the government of Quebec also plans to improve its law soon . 
it is already very good , but it has to be amended to take the fast evolution of electronic commerce into account . 
in closing , I really wonder what the motives of the government were , when it cut discussion of this bill short . 
i am convinced that the government will not respond to what has just been said on possible abuse and failure to abide by the rules governing protection of personal information for reasons of national security or other reasons . 
i am convinced that the members will not deal with all those important issues , which deserve a response . 
the government must seek further advice from the stakeholders . 
it should do its work properly , not push the bill through by Friday , thereby preventing in - depth discussion of its provisions . 
i am extremely concerned when I see a government that wants to be seen as protecting personal information but leaves the bill riddled with loopholes , particularly for its own ends . 
if the law is good for everybody , how is it that the government is trying to be exempt from its provisions or to exempt some of its components or activities from them ? 
i think there is reason to be worried . 
we will obviously oppose some of the government ' s amendments in this group . 
we urge the House to support our own amendments , whose purpose is to have the primacy of the Quebec law recognized and to solve at least this part of the problem raised by Bill C - 6 . 
Mr. John Cannis ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when it comes to discussing time , let me point out that plenty of time was allocated to discuss the bill in the last session . 
with respect to discussing the second group of motions , I am puzzled about how the Bloc can deny all Canadians the opportunity to provide this privacy protection which they need , have been asking for and of course deserve . 
that is why Motion No. 3 must be rejected . 
motion No. 4 clarifies that even non - profit and charitable sectors of our economy , when engaged in commercial activities such as the barter and sale of membership and donor lists , are covered by the bill . 
this is a very good motion and one which we should support . 
i congratulate my colleague the member for Wentworth - Burlington for his creativity and insight in bringing forward this motion . 
with Motion No. 6 the Bloc again would have us deny Canadians the personal information protection they have been calling for . 
therefore we must reject this motion . 
motions Nos. 7 and 46 will undermine the protection that is given to Canadians by Bill C - 6 . 
we will not ignore the needs and expectations of all Canadians to have their information and privacy protected with an effective law . 
motion No. 8 will clarify that part 1 of the bill will prevail over subsequent legislation only unless the subsequent legislation specifically provides otherwise . 
it also clarifies that part 1 prevails over amendments to existing legislation unless the amending act provides otherwise . 
i urge members to support this motion also . 
motions Nos. 11 , 14 , 18 and 19 introduce a subclass of personal information . 
bill C - 6 affords the same level of protection to all personal information and we must therefore reject these motions . 
motion No. 12 is clearly a delaying tactic on behalf of the Bloc and cannot be accepted . 
there are five motions to amend clause 7 of Bill C - 6 which are closely related , Motion Nos. 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 20 . 
these amendments make changes to three existing provisions and introduce two new provisions in order to ensure that Canadian law enforcement and other investigatory bodies continue to carry out their mandate in the manner they currently do . 
motion No. 13 to amend clause 7 ( 2 ) ( a ) broadens the type of offences that organizations can investigate using personal information without consent where they believe there has been a contravention of the law . 
motion No. 15 will add new paragraph ( c .1 ) to clause 7 ( 3 ) to allow disclosure of personal information without consent to government institutions which require the information in order to undertake investigations or enforce or administer laws at the discretion of organizations . 
this new paragraph clarifies for organizations the circumstances under which they may accede at their discretion to the legitimate requests of government institutions for personal information , for national security , law enforcement and administrative purposes where they have lawful authority . 
this amendment allows the status quo to continue . 
the intent of the bill is to regulate the commercial use of personal information . 
for instance , in the case of the publicly funded health care system , the bill is not intended to impede the flow of information necessary for the protection of patients ' health and the improvement of the administration of health care . 
to clarify this , the minister tabled this amendment on October 15 which specifically addresses the need to share information without consent when it is necessary for the administration of a law or a program . 
the information highway offers opportunities to improve the efficiency and accountability of our health care system . 
organizations like the Canadian Institute for Health Information assists in this endeavour . 
bill C - 6 is intended to facilitate these initiatives as it provides a basic set of fair information practices around which all stakeholders can harmonize . 
in the pursuit of a harmonized privacy protection regime for Canada , we encourage all the provinces and territories to move swiftly to legislate broadly in their own jurisdictions . 
motion No. 16 to amend clause 7 ( 3 ) ( d ) reflects the previous two amendments in Motions Nos. 2 and 3 for the purpose of consistency . 
it will continue to allow disclosures by organizations on their own initiative to national security and law enforcement agencies where the organization has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a contravention of a law or a breach of an agreement . 
this amendment requires a consequential amendment to clause 7 ( 5 ) which is contained in Motion No. 20 . 
i urge members to support Motion Nos. 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 20 which merely codify the status quo and allow businesses to continue to co - operate with law enforcement agencies where appropriate . 
these amendments do not grant new powers to government institutions nor do they create additional burdens on businesses . 
i urge members to vote in support of Motion Nos. 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 20 . 
motion No. 21 must be rejected because Bill C - 6 gives all personal information the same protection . 
we will not treat one class differently from another . 
motion No. 22 attempts the same thing and must also be rejected . 
with Motions Nos. 23 and 25 the Bloc is continuing with its delay tactics . 
therefore I recommend that these motions be rejected . 
motion No. 24 must also be rejected because Bill C - 6 already deals with this specific issue . 
motion No. 26 would amend the bill by detailing the particular circumstances in which a company would not reveal information to an individual , following his or her request for access to his or her personal information , the fact that a national security or law enforcement agency had contacted the company and the procedures that must be followed in such instances . 
where a government institution objects to disclosure because an investigation or national security would be compromised and the organization denies access of this information to an individual because an investigation or national security could be compromised , the organization must notify the privacy commissioner in writing and without delay of refusal . 
these amendments do not provide law enforcement with additional powers . 
moreover , the amendments do not restrict the individual ' s access to his or her personal information collected by the company . 
these amendments simply safeguard investigations . 
for these reasons , these amendments must be supported by all members . 
we must reject Motion No. 34 . 
as I have said before , the Bloc does not want to give all Canadians the privacy protection they have called for . 
motion No. 35 will amend clause 17 and will provide that federal court hearings under part 1 of Bill C - 6 be conducted with every reasonable precaution to avoid disclosure of any information that an organization could refuse to disclose to an individual . 
it clarifies that the court can receive representation ex parte and conduct hearings in camera in these circumstances . 
we must support the motion . 
motion No. 45 to amend clause 26 allows the governor in council to make regulations specifying , by name or by class , what is a government institution or part of a government institution for the purpose of part 1 . 
it also clarifies that the specification of an investigative body for the purpose of part 1 can also be done by name or by class . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry , but the hon. parliamentary secretary ' s time is up . 
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to take part in the debate today on part 2 amendments to Bill C - 6 which was formerly Bill C - 54 . 
this is a fairly new area for me . 
i just became the industry critic for the official opposition about a week ago . 
the former critic , my colleague from Edmonton - Strathcona , has done some excellent work in this area . 
i know he has the support of a lot of advocacy groups that would like to see some changes made to the bill . 
i will talk about them in a few moments . 
when I was following the bill in my capacity as a trade critic for our party , I thought it would deal essentially with the e - commerce aspect . 
if there was to be a privacy bill , I thought that it would be a stand alone bill . 
i would have preferred if that had been the case . 
we know there is a need to update Canada ' s law with regard to electronic commerce . 
technology has passed a lot of things by . 
there is product moving around the world on aircraft these days , such as UPS which wants to have electronic signatures which will speed up the whole area of getting paid faster and so on . 
the bill is essentially divided into two areas , privacy and electronic commerce . 
we will not be supporting the Bloc on its amendments because we see them as a delaying tactic . 
however , I do have some sympathy for the Bloc members ' concerns about the federal government again muscling its way into provincial jurisdiction and not using a co - operative approach . 
it is deplorable that it would rather use the stick than the carrot to achieve its goals . 
i suggest the government should learn that we can get a lot further with the carrot approach . 
i have concerns regarding what I would see as provincial jurisdictions in a few areas that the federal government is moving into . 
the federal government has moved , with its jurisdictional levers in using the hammer approach on the trade and commerce aspect , by saying that if it cannot get co - operation it will do it on its own and if they do not put in legislation within a three year timeframe , federal legislation will to apply . 
that is a pretty crude instrument to use . 
i am concerned that the provinces will need to introduce privacy information and legislation in the area of health care and all the social areas that the public is so concerned about . 
we need privacy surrounding medical records and records in terms of who is on social welfare . 
those kind of things need to be introduced quickly by the provinces to protect that area . 
we know the federal government has moved in the area of health care that is within its jurisdiction . 
it is nibbling at the edges , but if the provinces do not put in their own legislation , it is not clear what will happen in the area of health care privacy as introduced in the bill . 
quite frankly , a lot of people have good reason to not trust the government as to what its intentions are . 
we saw it muscle into provincial jurisdiction over the years . 
the Liberal Party has been in power for 70 years this century . 
we have seen the amount of workload and the number of bureaucrats increase . 
it is partly because it has muscled into provincial areas of jurisdiction . 
the old BNA of 1867 was pretty clear on what that jurisdiction was and that needs to be respected . 
i think we would have a lot stronger country for it . 
however , because it is not clear , it is important that the provinces act on their own to protect those interests . 
i am concerned about the use of time allocation again . 
i know there is a bit of a filibuster going on by the Bloc members . 
i think they have some reason to do that because of this idea of getting into the area of provincial jurisdiction . 
however , we have to remind the Liberal government that it is soon going to be approaching the Brian Mulroney record of 65 time allocations . 
the Liberals are going to beat him to it . 
i want to get to the point about the amendments that my colleague from Edmonton - Strathcona has introduced which will help clarify some of the social areas regarding health and health information . 
they are Motions Nos. 11 , 14 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 and 24 . 
i will take a moment to outline the general thrust of those motions . 
those proposed amendments would require organizations to obtain an individual ' s fully informed and expressed consent before using personal health information for a new purpose that is substantially different from the purpose which the information which was originally collected . 
the Liberals may argue that this protection already exists in the legislation , but our goal is to make sure that it exists . 
we think these amendments move to strengthen that , in particular with respect to health information . 
the Liberals may again argue that they do not want to give the privacy commissioner binding powers . 
the proposed amendments would prohibit the outright disclosure of personal health information to financial institutions . 
this is a very strong proposal that would ensure that banks do not attempt to collect health information that could be used to refuse mortgages and other financial services . 
we think that those amendments will strengthen the legislation . 
in principle , we support Bill C - 6 and we are going to be supporting those portions of it that we think are helpful . 
there is a fine balance as we move to the new technologies . 
i know that it is a fine balance to try to strike that there should be open and free discussion , free speech . 
we do believe that the government has an obligation to protect the privacy of our citizens and therefore support the broad thrust of Bill C - 6 . 
i want to just point out in the time I have left that my colleague for Edmonton - Strathcona has had pretty broad support for his amendments . 
i would urge the government to take that into account and vote for them this afternoon . 
he states that our personal health information is among the most sensitive and private information about us . 
it is highly vulnerable to abuse and therefore deserves special legal protection . 
i have another endorsement from Thomas B . Riley , the chair of the Canada ' s Coalition for Public Information . 
we believe in the importance of Bill C - 54 and the importance of adding amendments related to health information '' . 
i would suggest that there is a number of groups that believe it is important to strengthen the legislation to make absolutely sure that health care , health information and the social area information is not being abused . 
i believe these amendments would strengthen it . 
i would therefore ask that the government put its support behind these important amendments to strengthen the legislation . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i would simply advise hon. members , and I know the hon. member for Peace River will be particularly interested , that I myself ran into difficulty when quoting works with members names in the works . 
members cannot quote something and thereby use a members name when they are not permitted to do it directly . 
i would urge hon. members to refrain from mentioning one another by name and stick with the constituency name or title as required under the rules . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to rise in the debate . 
i am speaking to Motion No. 4 , an amendment which I put to the legislation . 
i am confident that this amendment will have the support of all sides of the House . 
i look forward to the report stage vote to see whether indeed all members support Motion No. 4 , if I may advertise it . 
i live in a village in central Canada . 
just a few weeks ago I received an unsolicited phone call . 
it was from a woman asking me to donate to I think it was the wheelchair handicap society . 
my amendment addresses the issue of how I came to be on that list and how people , how relatives and how senior citizens come to be on lists where they receive unwanted solicitations , unsought solicitations and solicitations that often cost them a great deal of money . 
now for the evidence , and I have evidence . 
for instance , I have here before me an Internet bulletin that was directed toward the Canadian Direct Marketing Association . 
it quotes a broker for direct market lists . 
this person says that some of the best lists to get hold of if one wants to sell a product by direct marketing or telemarketing are for example The Economist , The Financial Post , Scientific American or T é l é m é dia , or the Wellness Letter . 
we can say fine , the legislation as it exists does cover organizations such as those because they are commercial organizations and consequently they will be required to obey the provisions in this privacy act . 
indeed by coincidence , I have a proposal from a direct marketing firm in Maryland , U.S.A. to Mothers Against Drunk Driving , which is a Canadian charity . 
this is a proposal on how the organization , if it can get the donor list of MADD Canada , can sell to that list with various advantages to MADD Canada . 
in fact MADD Canada does not have to put up any money . 
there is a procedure whereby the telemarketer covers its costs before the charity receives the benefit of the telemarketing campaign . 
there is an interesting clause . 
that sounds good . 
then it goes on to say that MADD Canada agrees that while the file is theirs at all times , CDR has a lien against MADD Canada ' s donor file until all mailing lists outlined above are paid up in full . 
what is a lien ? 
it is called the Canadian exchange list summary . 
of course , when we are talking about exchange , we are not necessarily talking about the exchange of money . 
we are talking about the exchange of lists for the purposes of making money . 
i think the term that would cover that is barter . 
they are bartering something . 
i wonder how they got that list and I wonder if the corporate donors know they are on the list . 
there is also the Canadian Environmental Defence Fund the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies and so on . 
and what do we have here ? 
we have the B.C. NDP as well , and if I turn the page , we have the Ontario NDP . 
those are two political parties . 
i have to be fair here because we can also find the Ontario Liberals . 
we have to be careful that we do not throw stones around here , because I think if one examined the donor lists , the exchange lists of other telemarketing organizations , one would find pretty well all the political parties . 
the point of all this is that these names are appearing on these lists without the knowledge of the people who are actually contributing to the organizations . 
i would only wish that the many organizations on this list I was citing had shown the same type of prudence , shall we say , and responsibility as MADD Canada and not gotten into this type of arrangement . 
at any rate with the bill itself , I am going to explain briefly how my amendment works . 
if we look through the bill we will find that clause 16 gives the penalties that exist in the bill . 
it describes principally what the bill does . 
it states what the terms of privacy are that must be fulfilled by the various organizations covered by the bill . 
i think the most important principle in this bill that is covered in schedule 1 is the idea that when organizations use personal information , they must get the consent of the people they are getting that information from . 
that is very clearly spelled out in schedule 1 , section 4.3.1 . 
the section just above that also stresses in the case of mailing lists , which is what I was just talking about , organizations providing the list should be expected to obtain consent before disclosing the list of personal information to other organizations . 
then we come to my amendment . 
it amends in clause 2 the definition " commercial activity " which means any particular transaction , act or conduct that is of a commercial character and adds the words " including the selling , bartering or leasing of donor , membership or other fundraising lists '' . 
Checkmate . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted to speak this afternoon to this group of motions . 
i want to say from the very start that the New Democrats actually applaud the efforts of the Reform members of parliament to strengthen Bill C - 6 to protect medical privacy . 
we believe these motions are extremely important because medical records contain the most intimate , personal , potentially embarrassing and stigmatizing information that is ever collected about us , Mr. Speaker . 
you know that situation from your own experience . 
it affects all of us since at some point in our lives we all seek medical care of one kind or another . 
these motions are extremely important because medical information is very vulnerable to abuse , which I suppose is the quiet theme throughout Bill C - 6 . 
we must remember that the primary purpose for collecting personal medical information from the patient is for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of that patient . 
this is the reason we confide information to our physician in the first place . 
if we cannot trust our physicians or medical clinics to keep highly sensitive and personal facts confidential , a crucial foundation of the relationship between the patient and the doctor is undermined . 
if that happens , patients will be less willing to divulge personal information and this could affect the diagnosis and treatment . 
these motions before us underline exactly what is at stake for patients in this debate . 
the decisions we take on these motions as policymakers could have a profound impact on the delivery and quality of health care in our country . 
trade - offs do not serve the patients or the medical establishment at all . 
patients are owed the right of confidentiality and we must ensure that this is enforced . 
we support the Reform motions that seek to guarantee each patient in the country the right to medical privacy . 
we strongly support Motion No. 18 which prohibits financial institutions from obtaining the personal medical information of citizens . 
they do not need this information and can only very weakly attempt to argue that they need access to this type of personal information about Canadian individuals . 
new Democrats believe that simply because of changes in technology , in other words the computerization of medical records , patient privacy or values should not be compromised . 
we will support the Reform motions that make a significant effort toward strengthening the provisions of Bill C - 6 in respect of medical privacy . 
i now refer to some of the Liberal motions . 
i know you study the motions carefully , Mr. Speaker . 
these motions respond to a concern raised by government and law enforcement agencies in respect to investigations . 
we support these motions because they are needed in order to maintain the status quo when it comes to government and law enforcement investigative procedures . 
this sends a very inappropriate signal to those in society who we consider to be unscrupulous people , people who are con artists or swindlers of one kind or another . 
basically it says that in British Columbia if people who are participating in some illegal or fraudulent activity , stock market manipulations or swindling get caught , which is highly unlikely , even then probably nothing will happen to them because the RCMP simply does not have the resources to proceed with an investigation . 
as members of parliament we have to listen to this RCMP spokesperson . 
we all know RCMP officers or members of their families . 
they are reluctant to complain publicly about anything to do with their effectiveness as police officers or their ability to enforce the law . 
therefore when a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police writes a letter and makes it public to say that he is sorry that they cannot uphold the law in that part of Canada , then there is something terribly wrong . 
that is an RCMP officer ' s way of screaming to the public . 
we would think that writing a letter is still pretty quiet but for the RCMP this is a major statement that they are in serious financial trouble . 
i know you are deeply concerned , Mr. Speaker . 
i urge the solicitor general to give this more thought . 
going back to the Liberal motions before us , I want to make it very clear that the New Democrats will support these motions . 
they are needed in order to maintain the situation now when it comes to investigative police work . 
these motions basically mean that private groups must disclose , without consent , personal information on citizens to government and law enforcement agencies when they are requested to do so for investigative purposes in the interest of national security . 
ideally , to be fair , New Democrats would prefer that if law enforcement agencies ask for personal information on citizens that they be required to obtain a search warrant and establish reasonable grounds for both the need and the purpose of obtaining the personal information . 
however , in this case we believe it is more important that Bill C - 6 be passed now and that consumers be given the privacy protection they deserve which in our judgment is what this bill does . 
we would like to see it a lot tougher but it is not a perfect world . 
we will certainly not be an obstacle to law enforcement agencies carrying out their responsibilities . 
we are dealing here with what can only be described as the modern day version of the industrial revolution . 
we are changing the way Canadians do business . 
we are changing the way we as individuals conduct our business affairs . 
i suppose like most revolutions we often do not know they are taking place until they are kind of over and we realize there has been a major revolution or a major change in the way things have occurred . 
we are in one of these processes . 
as we attempt to become one of or perhaps the most electronically connected country in the world , providing leadership to other countries in terms of what to do , Bill C - 6 is a major step in that direction . 
it indicates as a priority the need to protect the privacy of information and to ensure people feel secure that when they provide information electronically they will not be revealing anything they are not intending to reveal . 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the PC Party of Canada I am pleased to speak to this group of amendments to Bill C - 6 , the personal information and electronic documents act . 
before I comment on this group of motions , I would like to welcome the member for Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valley as the new NDP member , the member for Peace River as the Reform member and the member for T é miscamingue as the new Bloc member of the industry committee . 
i know we share many political views . 
in a lot of ways we do not agree , but I look forward to their active involvement and participation in the committee . 
unlike the Group No. 1 motions which consisted exclusively of amendments of my Bloc colleague , Group No. 2 motions comprise amendments of a variety of members both from the government and the opposition . 
i will try to address as many of the amendments as possible during my 10 minutes . 
i should like to differentiate from the Bloc on one of its amendments . 
motion No. 51 would amend clause 29 which deals with a mandatory review of the act every five years . 
on a side note , I find it interesting that the Liberal government would support this clause when the government House leader recently expressed his discomfort with mandatory statutory reviews . 
motion No. 51 from the member for T é miscamingue would delete the reference to a statutory review by a committee of both houses of parliament , opting instead for a committee exclusively of the House of Commons . 
this is just the latest example of needless Senate bashing . 
senators have made valuable contributions to joint committees , the latest example being the joint committee on child custody and access . 
were it not for the battle waged by Conservative senators and courageous Liberal senators like Senator Anne Cools during the last parliament , we would not have had the review of the Divorce Act as it relates to child custody and access . 
i therefore do not feel that we should tie the hands of future members of parliament and future governments by not allowing them to review their statutes with their colleagues in the upper house . 
Roger Tass é , Jacques Fr é mont , and Claude Mass é . 
with all due respect to my committee colleagues , we would have benefited from having a noted constitutional law expert like Conservative Senator G é rald Beaudoin asking questions of these benefits . 
let us oppose Motion No. 51 to keep the door open for Senate expertise on statutory review . 
i commend my Reform colleague from Peace River for the amendments he brought forward under Group No. 2 . They reflect a concern expressed by several health care organizations , several of which I had the pleasure of meeting prior to their appearance before the industry committee . 
the amendments clarify the definition of personal information and disclosure as they relate to the health care field . 
i recognize that the Ontario government would prefer this definition to be left with provincial governments . 
i agree , but I worry what will happen to medical practitioners if this law passes without some guidance as to their use of personal information . 
the PC Party of Canada will offer guarded support to Motions Nos. 11 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 and 24 . 
this position is not my first choice . 
the federal government should have sat down with the provinces and territories to negotiate a harmonized definition of personal information as it relates to health care , but by and large the Liberals refuse to compromise or co - operate . 
as I did during my remarks on Group No. 1 , I will give credit where credit is due to the government on its amendments in Group No. 2 . 
many in the insurance and law enforcement community objected to the overrestrictive provisions on the disclosure and use of personal information . 
they were concerned this would seriously hamper efforts to fight crime or cases of insurance fraud . 
i was pleased to reinforce the concerns expressed by organizations such as the Insurance Bureau of Canada . 
with this in mind I trust with these amendments we have struck a better balance for all concerned parties . 
we in the PC Party believe in the need for personal privacy legislation , but we do not feel the government has adequately taken into account the views and concerns of the Ontario and Quebec governments . 
we do not feel it has adequately considered the cost impact of the new regulatory regime of Bill C - 6 on the private sector . 
in many ways this is a frustrating process for the simple reason that we in the Progressive Conservative caucus support the aims and principles of what Bill C - 6 is trying to accomplish . 
however it cannot be lost to even the casual observer that the Liberal government is zealously attempting to buck the reality of our economy . 
the reality is that our neighbour to the south is our biggest trading partner . 
no amount of wishful thinking on the part of xenophobic colleagues across the way will change that . 
on the brain drain which the government has ridiculed as being a figment of our imagination , it was refreshing to see that it woke up long enough to address it in the throne speech last week . 
brain drain is another natural consequence of Canadian politics being out of step with that of our American colleagues . 
it is simple cause and effect . 
that is why I have tried in vain to convince my Liberal colleagues on the industry committee that by pushing through the electronic commerce bill , a bill modelled on the European approach and in direct opposition to the American approach , we are headed for a competitive headache . 
foolishly I had hoped that the long summer break and extended delay caused by the prorogation of the House would have motivated the minister to take the time to try to improve Bill C - 6 . 
unfortunately we still have a bill that deliberately antagonizes Quebec , Ontario and the United States as well as scores of associations whose well - intentioned submissions to our committee were ignored . 
arrogance remains the order of the day . 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak to the Group No. 2 proposed amendments to Bill C - 6 , the personal information protection and electronic documents act . 
the majority of the Standing Committee on Industry of which I was chair in the last session strongly supported Bill C - 54 , which is now Bill C - 6 . 
bill C - 54 , as it was referred to in the last session , was then deliberated in committee on three separate occasions for more than eight hours . 
the committee put forth more than 50 improvements to the bill and passed these amendments on March 25 , 1999 . I had the privilege to report the bill back to the House as amended on Tuesday , April 13 , 1999 , 
the privacy commissioner was one of many witnesses who told us why the bill was so important . 
in his first appearance at committee he noted : 
i support and my office supports this bill . 
it is in my opinion , long overdue . 
it puts Canada close to the same level of privacy recognition and data protection that now exists in almost all of western industrialized Europe and various other jurisdictions . 
it puts us ahead of the game with the United States . 
bill C - 6 is intended to protect personal information in the private sector and to give electronic signatures a basis in law . 
it provides clear ground rules for business and helps improve consumer confidence , resulting in an environment that will foster the growth of electronic commerce in Canada . 
the purpose of the bill is to establish rules to govern the collection , use and disclosure of personal information in a manner that recognizes the right of privacy of all individuals and the need of organizations to collect , use or disclose personal information for a reasonable purpose . 
this is necessary in an era in which technology increasingly facilitates the collection and exchange of information . 
as I mentioned earlier , the purpose of the committee ' s hearings was to listen to expert witnesses from various sectors of industry to determine how the bill could be improved to ensure the individual ' s right to protective privacy and industry ' s ability to make an honest living . 
consequently many changes and suggestions were made . 
to begin the committee added the definition of commercial activity to subclause 2 ( 1 ) . 
the committee heard from Anne Cavoukian , the privacy commissioner of Ontario , that the definition was necessary to distinguish commercial activities from non - commercial activities . 
the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre stated that such a definition was necessary . 
as the Public Interest Advocacy Centre indicated in its submission , some activities by private sector enterprises may or may not be considered commercial , for example data processing within the organization for administrative purposes , data sharing among businesses for the purpose of detecting bad credit risks , collection and use of personal data by professional bodies . 
where provinces fail to act there will be an incentive for data users to characterize their activities as non - commercial so as to avoid application of the legislation . 
it would therefore be helpful to define the term commercial activity so as to provide more certainty for both data users such as academics , researchers and non - profits and data subjects . 
therefore commercial activity means any particular transaction , act or conduct , or any regular course of conduct that is of a commercial character . 
the definition of personal information was modified in subclause 2 ( 1 ) . 
several witnesses such as the Association of Canadian Archivists , the Writers ' Union , the Western Forum of Credit & Financial Executives and the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters criticized the definition as being too broad . 
others such as Public Interest Advocacy Centre , Valerie Steeves , the Ontario privacy commissioner , the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Canadian Medical Association wanted it to be more specific with reference to data elements such as health records , anonymized records and biological tissue samples . 
the proposed definition will therefore capture all personal information about an identifiable individual , except business addresses and phone numbers . 
the committee also heard strong arguments as to why the definition of use should be deleted from the bill . 
in recommending this change Telus and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce testified that they wanted to ensure companies would be able to transfer information from one division to another within an organization . 
the purpose clause of the bill was also amended , clause 3 . 
it was important to recognize this international aspect and afford the bill ' s protection to all personal data coming into Canada . 
it will also assist in meeting the adequacy test found in the EU directive on protection of personal data . 
it also avoids complications regarding non - Canadian residents , tourists and landed immigrants . 
as the privacy commissioner commented , Bill C - 54 represents a significant step toward filling in the gaps in the patchwork of laws and policies that offer data protection in Canada . 
it promises to bring Canada into line with international data protection norms . 
this advance is long overdue . 
most European countries and many other jurisdictions around the world long ago extended the right to the protection of personal information held by the private sector . 
regrettably at committee stage we did not have everything in front of us . 
because of the complex issues we are now able to make an amendment and Motion No. 17 would allow organizations to disclose information to the private sector investigative bodies which are listed in the regulations in order to investigate breaches of agreements or contravention of laws . 
this addresses a number of the concerns of witnesses , particularly in the insurance industry . 
there are many things to talk about today with respect to this bill and how important it is as we move forward . 
i would like to let members know that the committee felt that because of the importance of the privacy provisions of the bill , and the need to assess the impact and workability of the provisions , Part 1 of the bill should be reviewed every five years . 
that is good news . 
in her second appearance before the committee the Ontario Privacy Commissioner , Anne Cavoukian , welcomed this change . 
she stated : 
i am pleased that the bill calls for a mandatory five year review as a means of judging the overall effectiveness of the legislation in practice . 
this review , to analyse the working of the law in practice , both on a national level and a provincial level would note which provinces , aside from Quebec , have adopted corresponding legislation where any gaps or omissions may appear in the country ' s privacy coverage . 
i would like to thank all members of the committee for their hard work on this bill . 
i believe that the amendments put forth both at committee and in the motions presented today by the government forge a stronger bill for all Canadians . 
as the Privacy Commissioner said in his first appearance at the committee : 
it is not a perfect bill . 
i cannot recall in my own experience , in one capacity or another , ever seeing what could be described as a perfect bill . 
but it goes a long way toward doing what has to be done . 
with that the Privacy Commissioner predicted that various suggestions would occur during the hearings for the bill ' s improvement . 
they did and the bill was improved . 
today there are further motions which improve the bill even more . 
regardless , though , I think Mr. Phillips ' opening comments as Privacy Commissioner speak to the significance of this bill . 
he stated : 
i want to make it clear now that I would be very sorry to see this bill fail because of what I consider to be minor deficiencies . 
it recognizes the basic principle that people have a right to some control over their personal information no matter where it is being used in the Canadian community . 
that is the first and most important principle of good privacy protection . 
it embodies the notion of knowledge of things that are being done with people ' s personal information . 
it is a good bill in that respect . 
i hope that all members of the House support the government ' s motions and amendments today and will support Bill C - 6 . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would very much like , following the remarks by our colleague from the Liberal Party , to say " The Bloc Quebecois will support this bill '' . 
but you know that the Bloc Quebecois will not support this bill , not because it would not provide good services to our Canadian friends , but because it , unfortunately , is being forced on Quebec by the Minister of Industry , and Quebec has already had , for many years , a law in effect , which is effective and meets our needs . 
i am perhaps in a somewhat special position , because , if I go back to 1992 , before I became a member , I was the president of the Association de s é curit é informatique de la r é gion de Qu é bec . 
as such , I had the opportunity to submit a brief from our association to a parliamentary committee of the National Assembly on the subject of the establishment of a law to protect personal information in private enterprise , a Quebec law . 
the Liberal government in office at that point , that of Mr. Bourassa , introduced the legislation . 
it was passed , it took effect and it is recognized worldwide as one of the best laws to protect personal information in private enterprise . 
when we see the bill that is before us today , we are pleased that , seven years after Quebec , Canada has finally decided to provide personal information protection for Canadians . 
however , as an expert on these issues , I dare say that the bill proposed by the minister is rather weak compared to the law that has been in effect in Quebec for quite a few years now . 
the Minister of Industry could have used the Quebec experience as a model . 
the Standing Committee on Industry heard a number of witnesses state their concerns . 
i want to mention one such concern expressed by the Conf é d é ration des syndicats nationaux , the CSN , which is a well - known central labour body . 
the CSN said : 
this bill is likely to create a problem by establishing two systems , depending on whether the information is used outside Quebec or not . 
indeed , a business could be subject to the Quebec law but , as soon as the information was transferred outside the province , the federal legislation would come into effect . 
and it would not be easy for an ordinary citizen to know where his information is gone . 
this is a major problem . 
Quebec businesses have already taken measures to ensure the protection of personal information . 
now , they will have to comply with a new law , and this means additional costs . 
in such a context , the effect in Quebec of Bill C - 54 - or Bill C - 6 now , since its number change - will be the opposite of what was intended . 
in Quebec we know that legislation has been in place for seven years , legislation that inspires trust . 
now certain sectors of activity which make considerable use of e - commerce , such as the banks , an important sector , a strategic sector , will be covered by legislation that is not as good as the Quebec legislation . 
in such a context , what are the consumers going to do ? 
they are going to exercise more caution , they will be more hesitant to use electronic resources . 
this is the exact opposite of what the bill is intended to do . 
what would the elegant solution have been ? 
the Minister of Industry referred to it when he stated that Quebec , and any other province that would like to have its own similar legislation , would be exempted from application of the federal act . 
that was a noble intention ; it would have allowed the Bloc Quebecois to support with pleasure the fact that Canadians are acquiring legislation to protect personal information . 
under the circumstances , however , we cannot in any way accept this duplication of legislation . 
while I am at it , I will quote Ian Lawson , an independent expert who testified before the Standing Committee on Industry precisely on this issue . 
he said " In order to resolve this problem of double legislation , the people of Quebec and the lawyers of Quebec will have a lot of work to do '' . 
why will lawyers in Quebec have so much work ? 
because businesses will have trouble knowing where they stand . 
things will be very difficult to sort out . 
the Standing Committee on Industry had every possible opportunity to inform the minister about the impact on Quebec of this legislation , although it is good news in the rest of Canada . 
the Minister of Industry chose to ignore that advice . 
but there is worse , even for the rest of Canada . 
the bill exempts from the authority of parliament entire , important sections explaining how this legislation will apply to Canadians and Quebecers . 
Michael Geist , a law professor at the University of Ottawa , told the Standing Committee on Industry " I have a problem with the fact that the code of the CSA '' , which is a standardizing body , " is simply attached as a schedule . 
the principles of the code should have been incorporated into the legislation itself . 
i fail to understand why it was not felt advisable to try to use them as a point of departure for drafting legislation that meets the needs of Canadians in several respects where the Code , which , as you know is a compromise , might not be up to the task '' . 
here we have a university professor telling us that the bill , despite its good intentions , has a entire section on which the regulations will be based that will not come under the authority of Parliament . 
the Canadian legislation , the bill proposed by the minister , is weak . 
Quebec has much tougher legislation that is a far better response to the needs of consumers . 
that will exempt us from all these kinds of problems . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I know my time is very limited , given that we have pulled time allocation on this particular debate , but I want to address the bill very quickly . 
the official opposition is supporting the bill , as was mentioned by my colleague from Peace River . 
my colleague from Essex earlier stood to talk about the merits of the bill . 
however , she did say that the bill was far from perfect , although a number of amendments put forward by the government would bring it closer . 
i would argue that if the government chose to support the amendments put forward by the official opposition , the bill would be even closer to being perfect . 
sitting through the industry committee hearings during the last session I had the time to hear from many different witnesses , a number of whom were from the health care profession . 
some of them were health care service providers who had a lot of concern about privacy when it comes to the transfer of documents , especially documents of a personal nature pertaining to health care . 
because I do not have time to expand on the motions , I want to read a quick summary of what the motions deal with , especially in the case of pertinent health care documentation . 
the proposed amendments should require organizations to obtain an individual ' s fully informed and express consent before using personal health information for a new purpose that is substantially different from the purpose for which the information was originally collected . 
the Liberals may argue that this protection already exists in the legislation , but our goal is to strengthen the legislation , with respect to health information in particular . 
this is not to come into conflict with the fact that health care is a provincial domain , but just to set the tone in order to strengthen information pertaining to health care and the privacy issues surrounding that particular information . 
the proposed amendments would also require that any -

adjournment PROCEEDINGS 
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved . 
fisheries 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today on the late show to clarify the question I had last week for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
since the Marshall decision was handed down by the supreme court , the lobster fishery in the maritime region has been thrown into absolute chaos . 
it has pitted families against families , workers against workers and fishermen against fishermen . 
it has also raised the issue of racism between non - natives and native groups . 
the reason is the lack of leadership by the federal government . 
for years and years previous Conservative and Liberal governments and the current Liberal government have denied the aboriginal people traditional and proper access to natural resources . 
every single time the aboriginal people came to the House of Commons or to the government to negotiate those outstanding treaties , the government of the day told them to pound sand and take their case to court . 
after the Delgamuukw decision , after the Sparrow decision and now after the Marshall decision , the government is like a deer caught in the headlights on an oncoming semi truck . 
it stands there and says " Duh , what do we do now '' . 
the unfortunate part is the people of Atlantic Canada do not have time to wait . 
back in April the Auditor General of Canada released a very damning report toward the DFO . 
it stated quite clearly that the shellfish industry was in serious trouble . 
last April the auditor general clearly said that DFO was managing the shellfish industry exactly the same way it managed the groundfish industry prior to the 1992 collapse of the cod stocks . 
on top of that , there is the collapse of the salmon stocks . 
now there is the collapse of the lobster , shrimp , scallops and crab stocks and every other species that is out there because of the lack of proper enforcement by the government . 
my question is quite clear . 
we had a solution that we presented to the minister 34 days ago . 
it is now day 35 of the Marshall decision and there still has been no clear action from the government . 
the fishermen of lobster fishing area number 33 are meeting tonight because people from the Burnt Church Indian reserve are laying traps in the Halifax harbour which will lead to more conflict and more confusion . 
there is still no leadership from the government . 
they must take a leadership role . 
they must go down and resolve this situation immediately . 
if they do not , I fear for the lobster stocks themselves . 
Mr. David Iftody ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question . 
i know his legitimate and ongoing interest in these matters . 
therefore I am pleased to provided those answers on behalf of my colleague , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
the House knows of the recent Marshall decision , the consequences emanating from that decision and the policy responses of the government to deal with the problem of bringing the two disputed parties together for a negotiated settlement . 
in that vein , Mr. James Mackenzie , our chief federal representative , has been very active in making contact with both aboriginal leaders and representatives of the commercial fishing industry . 
Mr. Mackenzie has been making initial contact in following up with both aboriginal leaders and representatives of the commercial fishing organizations since he was first appointed on October 15 , 1999 . 
Mr. Mackenzie is currently in the maritimes holding meetings with commercial sector representatives . 
Mr. Mackenzie is holding discussions with commercial representatives and seeking their views on an appropriate role in the process . 
commercial representatives can be assured that they will be fully consulted . 
once a process is designed the government will be looking at funding these needs . 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has made the development of a short and long term strategy , which is responsive to the supreme court decision and takes into account the interest of the commercial fishing sector , his number one priority . 
he has indicated his continued willingness to meet with commercial fishing representatives and to listen to their concerns . 
in addition , we are meeting with the aboriginal fishers and my own minister has done so . 
we will continue to look for a negotiated and peaceful settlement that is fair to all . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted . 
accordingly , the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
( the House adjourned at 7.17 p.m. )

government RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENTS 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in order to provide hon. members and the people of Canada with an update on government achievements , I have the pleasure to table , in both official languages , a report entitled " Managing for Results 1999 '' , along with performance reports from 82 departments and agencies .

criminal CODE 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 259 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( criminal liability of corporations , directors and officers ) . 
this is a bill that arises out of a recommendation from the public inquiry into the disastrous Westray tragedy in Nova Scotia that killed 26 miners unnecessarily . 
it will establish once and for all the public responsibility to protect employees in the country against any such disastrous outcome .

the SENATE 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , once again it is an honour and a pleasure for me to stand , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , to present a petition on behalf of a number of my constituents . 
they are very concerned about the fact that we have a Senate in our country . 
they consider it to be undemocratic and composed of unelected members that are unaccountable to the people of Canada . 
they point out the fact that there is a $ 50 million price tag attached to this . 
they say that this is something from another era and should not be taking place as we enter the 21 st century . 
they also say that we need to modernize our parliamentary institution , Mr. Speaker , which is something I know you feel strongly about . 
they are calling upon the parliament of Canada to take whatever measures are necessary to abolish the Senate of Canada .

points OF ORDER 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the adoption of this ways and means motion which is the first step in implementing legislation in regard to the Nisga ' a agreement is out of order . 
not only is this issue very controversial and will have a precedent setting impact on the entire country , the House should know this agreement is before the courts . 
Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 505 states : 
members are expected to refrain from discussing matters that are before the courts or tribunals which are courts of record . 
the purpose of this sub judice convention is to protect the parties in a case awaiting or undergoing trial and persons who stand to be affected by the outcome of a judicial enquiry . 
the government should not be allowed to proceed any further with Nisga ' a legislation since it affects one of our most fundamental rights of free speech . 
Beauchesne ' s also talks about respecting the sub judice convention in the interest of justice and fair play . 
notwithstanding the fact that legislation enabling the Nisga ' a agreement was passed by the most unpopular government in the history of British Columbia with a paltry 35 % of the vote of the electorate , we in this House must respect the objections and the objectives of the other 62 % of British Columbians and many other Canadians , including parties to several litigations on the matter , including the B.C. Liberals . 
when considering this point of order , Mr. Speaker , you must understand that we will stand up for the equal rights of all Canadians , including the Nisga ' a . 
we will do our utmost to convince the Liberal government to reconsider its position and to inform Canadians of the very significant mistakes that are being made . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
that is not what is before us today . 
it is whether or not the ways and means motions that was just passed is in order or out of order . 
first of all , the speech we just heard is actually a reflection upon a vote in the House and I would say that in itself offends , at least in my view , our standing orders . 
the standing orders say that the adoption of the ways and means motion - and that ways and means motion has now been adopted - is an order of the House to bring in a bill based thereon . 
therefore , this gives the minister the right , and some would say the obligation , to give first reading to the bill . 
the hon. member made a reference in his remarks with respect to issues that are before the courts and how we should refrain in debates from taking sides on issues when , at a criminal level , charges have been laid , or at the civil level once an issue reaches trial stage . 
the entire House , I am sure , knows that . 
therefore those points that were raised are not valid . 
this motion is indeed in order and has in fact been passed in the House . 
i believe that now is the time to introduce the bill pursuant to the motion that we have now passed by a vote of this House , democratically held . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
there is no bar whatsoever on the House itself considering legislation . 
Mr. Speaker , you would be well aware of the fact that if that was the case every time a matter wound up before the courts parliament would be completely impotent and paralysed from considering legislation . 
i would suggest that the point of order from the hon. member of the Reform Party is completely out of order . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would want to concur in the opinions offered by the government House leader and by the House leader of the Conservative Party . 
i find it very odd that a party that is always talking about power seeping away from parliament to the courts is today arguing that parliament cannot deal with an issue as important as the Nisga ' a treaty . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since first being elected to this place in 1993 I have witnessed over and over again that the government is not willing to respond to questions in this House when the matter is before the courts . 
Mr. Speaker , I ask you , how can we properly debate this fundamentally important issue to all Canadians and the Nisga ' a people when the matter is before the court ? 
this flies in the face of the conventions that I have understood since I came to this place in 1993 . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair would like to thank all hon. members who have participated in this for their assistance in dealing with this point of order , which was raised by the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford . 
he cited at the opening of his remarks citation 505 of the 6 th edition of Beauchesne . 
i would also draw to his attention and to the attention of all hon. members citation 506 , which reads : 
the sub judice convention has been applied consistently in criminal cases . 
i skip on to citation 507 , which reads : 
no settled practice has been developed in relation to civil cases , as the convention has been applied in some cases but not in others . 
in civil cases the convention does not apply until the matter has reached the trial stage . 
the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford has not brought to the House any indication that there is a criminal proceeding involving this case , nor is it possible to imagine how there could be at this time . 
accordingly , I feel that given the past practice of the House and given the fact that the House is master of its own procedure , I do not believe the House is bound by proceedings in the courts until the court has made a ruling that binds the House .

youth CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. John Maloney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure this morning to speak at second reading of Bill C - 3 , the youth criminal justice act . 
in the throne speech , the government indicated its intention to work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe . 
its focus will be balanced , combining prevention and a community - centred approach with action to deal with serious crime . 
this balanced approach is clearly reflected in Bill C - 3 which we are debating today . 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs extensively studied our youth justice system , travelling to all regions of the country and listening to Canadians . 
the members visited over 23 sites , involving a variety of facilities and programs . 
the committee also held a number of round table discussions at which it heard from many interests , both inside and outside the youth justice system . 
the committee produced an excellent report entitled " Renewing Youth Justice " and the government has responded to that report with excellent legislation . 
the minister of justice first introduced the youth criminal justice act during the last session of parliament as Bill C - 68 . 
the minister has had the benefit of having heard views on the bill in this House and from others with an interest in the complex issues surrounding youth justice . 
the government and many others continue to believe that the bill reflects a comprehensive , balanced and flexible framework for youth justice . 
Canadians believe that our current youth justice system is not working as well as it should in many significant areas and it needs to be overhauled . 
we know that it will take a sustained effort , involving all levels of government and many other partners to tackle the complex problem of youth crime and to build a fair and effective youth justice system . 
we look forward to their participation in a constructive fashion for the benefit of our children in crisis . 
that process is under way . 
in 1998 the minister of justice and the solicitor general launched the government ' s national crime prevention program . 
since then several millions of dollars have been invested in community based crime prevention initiatives across the country , dealing at the front end with the root causes of crime , with a special focus on children and youth at risk . 
since its launch the national strategy has supported more than 600 crime prevention and community safety projects throughout Canada . 
these are investments in our communities and in our youth . 
replacing and repealing the Young Offenders Act with the youth criminal justice act is the next step in a process of tackling youth crime . 
the new legislation signals to Canadians that a new youth justice regime is in place . 
the new legislation reflects in its preamble and principles the message Canadians want from their youth justice system : that it is there first and foremost to protect society ; that it fosters values such as respect for others and their property ; that it insists on accountability ; that it provides both violent and non - violent young offenders with consequences that are meaningful and proportionate to the seriousness of the offence ; that it be a youth justice system that is inclusive and that engages Canadians in their response to youth crime ; and that it does a better job of responding to the needs of victims . 
that being said , the needs of youth will always be considered . 
the new regime will be one which offers hope to youth and will give those who get in trouble with the law a chance to turn their lives around , for their sake , for the sake of their families and their communities . 
as the minister of justice has made clear in the House on many occasions , we on this side of the House are not prepared to criminalize 10 and 11 years olds . 
this is not the best way to address the needs of children who are faced with situations involving unacceptable behaviour . 
we believe that in those circumstances where a formal approach is required child welfare and the mental health systems are the preferred approaches . 
these systems have access to a wider array of services that are more age appropriate , family oriented and therapeutic than those available through the criminal justice system . 
we are committed to working with our provincial and territorial partners and non - governmental organizations on developing a comprehensive strategy for dealing effectively with children under 12 , particularly the small number of children in this age group who are involved in serious offences . 
i attended a conference sponsored by the minister of justice on September 27 to 29 of this year . 
participants from across the country exchanged information and ideas regarding best practices in dealing with the interrelated issues of child offending and child victimization . 
again , prevention is always the ultimate objective . 
the youth criminal justice act includes provisions for more meaningful consequences for the most serious violent young offenders . 
it expands the list of offences and lowers the age at which youth would presumptively receive adult sentences . 
in the legislation , youth 14 years and older who are convicted of murder , attempted murder , manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault will receive an adult sentence unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise . 
in addition , a fifth presumptive category for repeat violent offenders would be created . 
young offenders aged 14 and older who demonstrate a pattern of violent behaviour will receive an adult sentence unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise . 
bill C - 3 contains an important change to what may be the most controversial aspect of our youth justice legislation , the publication of names . 
the debate on this issue essentially involves two legitimate and competing values : the need to encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of publicity on the youth versus the need for a greater openness and transparency in the justice system . 
the proposed legislation now before the House strikes an appropriate balance between the competing views . 
it will permit the publication of the names upon conviction of all young offenders who qualify for an adult sentence . 
publication of the names of 14 to 17 year olds given a youth sentence for one of the presumptive offences could also be permitted . 
however , the legislation provides the crown with the flexibility to give notice at the beginning of a trial that it will not seek an adult sentence . 
thus , at the provincial or territorial crown ' s discretion a young person would receive a youth sentence and his or her name would not be published . 
the youth criminal justice act would also replace the current procedure for transfer to adult court by empowering all trial courts to grant adult sentences so that the youth retains age appropriate procedural protections and justice can be provided quickly , placing less of a burden on victims and their families . 
bill C - 3 contains other important reforms to the youth justice system . 
in response to concerns by the law enforcement community , judicial discretion would be permitted to allow voluntary statements by youth to police to be admitted into evidence . 
i spoke to many crown attorneys on this issue . 
this was the only section of the previous young offenders act that they would like to see changed . 
in response , we have done so . 
also in response to the concerns of victims , victim impact statements would be introduced in youth court and victim ' s access to information regarding proceedings would be improved . 
the bill also provides for an increased sentence for adults who undertake to the court to respect bail conditions involving supervision of a young person who would otherwise remain in custody and who wilfully fails to comply with those conditions . 
the bill provides that provinces may recover the costs of court appointed counsel from parents and young people who are fully capable of paying . 
the record keeping system for youth records would be simplified and would allow for greater access by authorized people in the interest of the administration of justice and research . 
it is important to note that the majority of young people who get in trouble with the law are non - violent and commit only one offence . 
unfortunately there are too many examples in our current youth justice system of young people serving time in jail for minor offences . 
bill C - 3 includes criteria on the use of custody so that it is used appropriately . 
further , the bill includes provisions for dealing with less serious offences outside the formal court process . 
police would be asked and encouraged to consider all options including a formal alternative to the court process before laying charges . 
the police , key partners in this strategy , will be given more authority to use verbal warnings or cautions to direct youth to informal police diversion programs such as family group conferences or more formal programs requiring community service or repairing the harm done to victims . 
while every effort would be made to reduce the over - reliance on incarceration , where necessary youth will be sentenced to custody . 
bill C - 3 includes provisions that respect an obligation to ensure that all young people , particularly the most serious offenders , receive effective treatment and rehabilitation . 
that reminds me of a visit the standing committee on justice made to the Pinel institute . 
rehabilitation works . 
youth should be given the opportunity to participate in such programs . 
furthermore , with respect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , youth will serve their sentences in youth facilities in almost every case . 
successfully rehabilitated youth means fewer victims , restored families , safer schools and stronger communities . 
to this end Bill C - 3 includes an intensive custodial sentence for the most high risk young offenders who are repeat violent offenders or have committed murder , attempted murder , manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault . 
these sentences are intended for offenders with serious psychological , mental , emotional illness or disturbances . 
the sentence will require a plan for intensive treatment and supervision of these offenders and will require the court to make all decisions to release them under controlled reintegration programs . 
the proposed legislation also makes an important reform to youth justice sentencing to foster the safe and effective reintegration of youth back into the communities . 
under the new law , judges will be required to impose a period of supervision in the community following custody . 
this will allow authorities to closely monitor and control the young offender and assure he or she receives the necessary treatment and programs to return successfully to the community . 
the period of supervision administered by the provinces will include stringent mandatory and optional conditions tailored to that individual . 
bill C - 3 provides a comprehensive , balanced and flexible legislative framework for youth justice . 
it was developed after consultation with the provinces , the police , the bar associations , youth justice workers , youth themselves , victims and other Canadians . 
the next important phase of the renewal of youth justice is directed at implementation of new youth justice legislation . 
youth justice professionals , community members and others will need information about the new system and sometimes training . 
the best answers to the complex problems of youth crime lie in integrated approaches . 
effective youth justice involves educators , child welfare and mental health systems , voluntary organizations , victims , families , youth employers , neighbourhood groups . 
it involves just about anyone who works with or cares about kids , our communities and our country . 
additional federal resources have already been made available to support this important challenge of renewing our system of youth justice . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , before I get into the text of my remarks , because there are no questions and comments for the first three speakers in this morning ' s debate , I would like to refer briefly to some of the comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice , the member for Erie - Lincoln . 
i am trying to point out to anyone who would care to assess the situation that there is a pat Liberal line to this . 
quite simply the parliamentary secretary , the member for Erie - Lincoln , merely read what the minister said . 
he probably had her speech sent to him , changed a few things and then stood up and presented it as his own position . 
the hon. member said that first and foremost the bill is to protect society . 
he went on to talk about consequences , of which there are very few in the legislation . 
he talked about a new regime , when everyone who studies the bill and compares it to the Young Offenders Act knows it is the same old crap that is merely dressed up and put forward with a new name . 
it does not change anything . 
the member said that the government is not prepared to criminalize 10 and 11 year olds . 
he went on to say in his remarks that the minister listened and consulted with Canadians from coast to coast and listened to the words of her own standing committee , a Liberal dominated standing committee I might add . 
what we find is that the government did not listen at all . 
yes it consulted and went through the motions of listening , but when we look at what is in Bill C - 3 , we see that it is just the same old stuff . 
i say at the outset that not much has changed . 
i am honoured to rise today on behalf of the official opposition to address this important issue of youth justice . 
reforming the Young Offenders Act was one of the cornerstones of the Reform Party ' s movement . 
it is an issue close to the hearts of thousands of concerned Canadians , many of them victims , or the families of victims which of course makes them victims as well . 
the role of a responsible government is to listen to the concerns of its citizens and to respond promptly with legislation that is fair , effective and in the best interests of those same citizens . 
the role of a responsible opposition is to critique the actions of the government , to offer support in areas of agreement , to criticize the areas where we disagree and to offer constructive alternatives to resolve those areas of disagreement . 
i will first discuss the state of youth crime in Canada . 
i have spoken many times in the Chamber about communicating with my constituents through a weekly newspaper column . 
i began writing this column long before I became an MP . 
i have written several times on the issue of youth crime , approximately 10 times over the past seven years . 
the response to these columns has been overwhelming in support of the changes Reform has been advocating for well over a decade . 
in my column of February 10 , 1993 , about eight months before I was elected for the first time to the House , I said : 
what greatly disturbs me is not just the increase in the number of crimes being committed by our young but their apparent total disregard for authority . 
almost daily we can find instances where truly heinous crimes are committed by these young people with no outward signs of remorse . 
why is it most of us believe we live in the best country on earth and yet we persist in mollycoddling our criminals because it ' s not really their fault they do the things they do ? 
the Reform Party believes that our justice system must place the punishment of crime and the protection of law - abiding citizens and their property ahead of all other objectives . 
this is not to say that other objectives such as the protection of the rights of the accused or rehabilitation of criminals , are unimportant . 
it is simply to say that protection of society is the reason for having a criminal justice system in the first place . 
it is amazing that these words were written almost seven years ago and that nothing substantial has been done to fix the problem . 
Canadians are fed up with young people who have no regard for authority , the community or the law . 
these young people need to be taught that there are consequences to their actions . 
in my opinion , the YOA created more criminals than it ever cured . 
let us be honest . 
in about a week it will be Hallowe ' en which traditionally is a time when kids like to play pranks . 
it comes from the very statement children make when they come to our doors , trick or treat . 
if we do not give out a treat we might get a trick played on us . 
i remember being a youngster growing up in rural Canada , in northern British Columbia . 
we used to like to go around , tip over the odd outhouse , soap a car ' s windshield and things like that . 
the reality is that we have moved far beyond that over the past 30 or 40 years . 
now we see outright acts of vandalism because of a gradual deterioration of consequences for criminal activity . 
it is not the pranks that are the problem . 
it is the crimes that erode communities , damage property and destroy families . 
it is the acts of violence that strike fear in the hearts of the elderly and the children who endure the harassment and brutality of a generation held unaccountable for its actions . 
it is the families that hold dear the memories of lost loved ones and the scars of a justice system that slaps the wrists of young offenders who beat , rape or murder . 
in my home province of British Columbia , the names of Reena Virk , Dawn Shaw , and Trygve Magnusson represent just a few victims who died at the hands of violent youth . 
their senseless deaths demand laws from the government that punish and deter those who commit violent acts and provide mandatory rehabilitation programs during incarceration . 
on the subject of those types of cases , I am reminded of something that seems to be quite new in our society , tragically . 
something serious must be done about this . 
we cannot continue to allow these acts of random violence by youths to go unpunished with a slap on the wrist . 
because these people who commit these crimes are young or are teenagers , they end up serving only a few months in incarceration , if that . 
young people naturally think they are invulnerable . 
some would argue that this is due to inexperience or an inability to understand the consequences . 
this may be true for some , but many young offenders are fully aware of the limits of the law and feel they have a free ticket to do as they please until they turn 18 . 
this attitude is the direct result of the Young Offenders Act . 
a piece of legislation intended to give troubled kids a second chance at a successful future has become a means of abetting criminal behaviour . 
the Young Offenders Act failed to establish a deterrent to crime and , I would suggest , it helped promote it . 
the tragedies of Taber , Alberta , Columbine High School in Colorado and several other places are horrific reminders of just how bad things can get and how vulnerable we are to senseless acts of violence whether by youth or adults . 
the emergence of video games , the Internet and the subject matter emphasized on television , movies and music dictate that parents , society and government must work together to establish parameters for our children . 
as parents , we must take an active role in screening what our kids see and do and intervene before things get out of hand . 
the role of society is to establish standards by consensus and ensure that these standards are represented in the laws passed by our governments . 
it is important to state that it is not the role of the justice system to fix the social inadequacies of society . 
that has been the major fault with the Young Offenders Act . 
its purpose was to deter people from breaking the law and to punish and rehabilitate those who do . 
i would like to move on to what Canadians want changed . 
it is interesting that the minister chose to add the word justice to this act because that is exactly what Canadians want . 
there are no shortcuts to this goal . 
that is what Canadians are looking for . 
that is what we hear daily when we consult with them . 
that is what the government heard , if only it would listen and respond appropriately with meaningful legislation . 
it will not take long , but I would like to briefly address what we agree with in Bill C - 3 . 
while much of the bill is a reconstituted YOA there are a few notable changes . 
these were outlined by the hon. member for Surrey North when he spoke to the bill the last time it was introduced . 
i am disappointed that the bill was reintroduced in the same form it was the last time , with only technical changes . 
the mere fact that the bill languished for months on the Order Paper is a testament to the level of priority the government gives it . 
when the House prorogued and the bill was still on the Order Paper , I rather foolishly hoped that the government had seen the light and would have introduced a new version that better represented the concerns of Canadians , the concerns that I just outlined . 
aside from that , there are some small victories in the bill for Canadians . 
the increased emphasis on police discretion will ensure that minor youth indiscretions can be addressed by police officers with warnings rather than laying charges . 
this initiative was proposed by the hon. member for Crowfoot in his minority report . 
the minister makes a big deal out of dealing with violent and non - violent offenders differently . 
i believe this is an excellent initiative as well , but it was also outlined in the Reform minority report . 
young people who commit non - violent crimes are more suitable for programs such as diversion , restorative justice and community service . 
it is not necessary to remove these individuals from society , only to ensure that they learn the error of their ways and develop a healthy respect for authority and the law . 
in March 1995 , in response to the first so - called changes to the Young Offenders Act that the now health minister made in Bill C - 37 , I wrote in my newspaper column the following : 
our justice system must distinguish between young , first time offenders who commit minor crimes and those who engage in habitual or violent criminal behaviour with no respect for property or even life itself . 
despite what some advocates would have us believe , not all young offenders who commit non - violent property crimes are harmless . 
many are already habitual criminals with no moral conscience and a warped value system . 
they do not understand why they should respect the lives and property of other Canadians . 
these youth need to know the punishment for their crimes will not be a slap on the wrist like raking leaves at the local park on weekends . 
these youth need a stronger reason to think before stealing another car . 
we need to strike a balance between deterrents and accountability , between punishment and rehabilitation . 
most non - violent offenders are excellent candidates for alternative measures , such as conditional sentences , for they pose little or no threat to society , only a need for restitution . 
the third area I would like to commend the minister for including is the issue of holding parents and legal guardians responsible for breaches of court ordered conditions by an offender under their care . 
this initiative was introduced by the hon. member for Surrey North in his private member ' s bill , Bill C - 210 , in the first session of this parliament . 
i know he is not seeking acknowledgement for that , but I certainly know he deserves it . 
i want to commend the minister for taking the first steps in publishing the names of those young offenders who commit serious crimes , although I am not convinced that the minister is going to actually get that accomplished . 
in her speech on Bill C - 68 , Bill C - 3 ' s forerunner , on March 22 , 1999 she had the following to say about the publication of names : 
the names of 14 to 17 year olds given a youth sentence for murder , attempted murder , manslaughter , aggravated assault or repeat violent offences could be published in certain circumstances . 
what does that mean ? 
the use of words like " could " and " certain circumstances " did not give the impression that the minister is serious about this matter . 
she has once again abdicated her responsibility to the lawyers and the courts . 
these may be loopholes that she as a lawyer would like to see in legislation , but I can tell her that these words are the last thing that victims of crimes and their families want to see in legislation . 
referring to the minister ' s comments in Hansard that day , I would also draw attention to another comment she made in referring to the publication of names . 
she said : 
the debate on this issue essentially involves two legitimate and competing values , 
i heard the parliamentary secretary say much the same thing in his remarks a few minutes ago . 
the need to encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of the publicity on youth versus the need for greater openness and transparency in the justice system . 
let us look at this . 
she referred to the need to encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of the publication on our youth . 
i would contend , and I think most Canadians would contend , that in some way the only thing that is going to rehabilitate these youngsters is if their peers and their community know who is committing the crimes . 
if their name is perhaps splashed on the front page of the paper when they commit a violent crime like this , they will be held accountable by their community , their peers , their parents and their families . 
it would be a bit of an embarrassment factor if nothing else . 
i think it is very misguided to state that . 
young people themselves are among the most outspoken , demanding the necessary change to the publication ban . 
if for no other reason than to protect the majority from the minority , our young people must know the identity of their violent peers . 
i will move on to what the Reform Party recommended . 
i will begin by congratulating two of my colleagues for the tremendous amount of work and time they have dedicated to the issue : the member for Crowfoot , who just yesterday reintroduced a private member ' s bill on this very issue ; and , the member for Surrey North , whose tragic life experiences and need to implement change in this area motivated him to actually run as a member of parliament . 
i will pause and remark that I am blessed with a son who is 16 years old right now . 
that is the very age that Jesse Cadman was when his life was tragically snuffed out by a young offender . 
as a parent who also has two daughters aged 20 and 18 , I do not want to imagine the horror of finding one of my children murdered . 
i worry about it every night and pray to God that my children are safe . 
i cannot understand a government that turns its back on so many senseless deaths and does not bring forward meaningful legislation . 
as a member of the justice committee , the member for Crowfoot travelled across Canada hearing from concerned Canadians frustrated by the system . 
the following are just some of the recommendations the Reform party presented in its minority report : first , make the protection of society the first and guiding principle of youth justice ; second , allow police officers to use discretion in resolving minor incidents without laying charges ; third , lower the maximum age of the youth justice act from 17 to 15 years of age ; fourth , lower the minimum age limit of the youth justice act from 12 to 10 years of age ; fifth , differentiate between non - violent and violent crimes ; sixth , increase the maximum length of all sentences ; seventh , youth facilities need mandatory rehabilitative programs ; eighth , minimum six month probation after all prison sentences ; ninth , move all 14 and 15 year old violent offenders automatically to adult court while limiting all other transfers ; tenth , the person who commits two or more violent offences must be designated a dangerous offender ; eleventh , allow for community based juvenile committees in every jurisdiction for non - violent and first time offenders ; twelfth , establish federal standards for alternative measures with well defined parameters ; thirteenth , publicize the names of violent young offenders , all of them and not just some of them ; fourteenth , adult young offender records to be treated the same as those of adults ; and fifteenth , require parents or legal guardians to appear at all court proceedings . 
i would like to highlight the recommendations calling for the reduction of the minimum age to 10 years old and the recommendation referring to alternative measures , as they are of particular importance to me . 
the minister and members opposite have portrayed Reform members as mean and nasty because we want to lower the minimum age to 10 years old . 
i have news for the minister . 
despite her accusations , Reform would never lock up 10 year olds , throw away the key and feed them bread and water . 
nothing could be further from the truth . 
however , by including 10 year olds in the legislation the government would be protecting these youngsters from those who use them to perpetrate crimes . 
these kids are targets and their participation is a crisis on the rise , especially in lower mainland of B.C. 
the minister refuses to acknowledge that the provinces and the police were interested in these changes and that even the Liberal dominated standing committee supported the idea . 
it was a recommendation from their own standing committee . 
another recommendation is alternative measures . 
alternative measures include several initiatives such as diversion , restorative justice and community service . 
i am most interested in what is known as conditional sentencing because this is a particular area of critic responsibility for me . 
there have been a number of horror stories from adult courts regarding the use of conditional sentences . 
i state emphatically that those convicted of violent crimes , whether adult or child , must not be given conditional sentences . 
it is imperative that violent offenders be removed from our society to protect society and provide punishment and rehabilitation and thus a deterrent . 
what is conditional sentencing ? 
conditional sentencing is a criminal code amendment giving judges the authority to impose a sentence to be served in the community . 
this means the offender would not go to jail but would remain living at home and going on with his or her daily routine of work or school under certain conditions . 
that is the title . 
when does it apply ? 
conditional sentencing applies in cases where an offender would have normally been sentenced to less than two years in custody . 
this amendment was the attempt of the Liberals to ease the burden on Canada ' s overcrowded prisons . 
conditional sentences were never intended to be used in violent crime cases . 
however the sentencing guidelines are vague and have been interpreted to include all crimes . 
many judges have interpreted this law broadly , allowing violent offenders to serve their sentences in the community . 
judges have handed down conditional sentences for crimes such as sexual assault , impaired driving , rape and even murder . 
our communities are at risk . 
i will cite a few examples . 
in Montreal three men were given 18 month conditional sentences after raping a 16 year old pregnant women and holding her upside down from a balcony . 
the judge thought that this was part of their culture . 
in Winnipeg a youth previously convicted of theft and seven armed robberies and on temporary leave from a Manitoba youth centre received a one year conditional sentence and three years probation for the drive - by shooting of a 13 year old . 
this is horrific . 
in Edmonton a 57 year old man who swung a machete at a 21 year old male , cutting his face and cutting a third of his ear off , got 240 hours of community service and a curfew for that crime . 
in Orleans , close to home here , Paul Gervais confessed to sexually assaulting nine boys . 
he got a two year conditional sentence and a curfew . 
he is serving his sentence at home . 
in Ottawa , right here in the nation ' s capital , Robert Turcotte strangled his mother to death . 
he received a two year conditional sentence , 100 hours of community service and a midnight curfew . 
the Liberal government ' s conditional sentencing law allows some convicted violent criminals to serve their sentences in the community , not in prison . 
what message does this send ? 
it sends the message that in our justice system there are minor consequences for major , serious crimes . 
eighty - four per cent of Canadians believe that people convicted of violent offences should be ineligible for conditional sentences , according to a recent national poll . 
amending the legislation is as simple as changing one clause . 
if the justice minister really wanted to change the law she could do so in one day with the co - operation of the House . 
rather than responding to the clear will of Canadians she prefers to let the courts decide these issues . 
i am about to reintroduce my private member ' s bill which lists the crimes that if passed would be excluded from consideration for conditional sentencing . 
along with a large majority of Canadians we support amending the criminal code to exclude dangerous crimes from conditional sentencing eligibility . 
someone convicted of a dangerous crime , including murder , manslaughter , armed robbery , kidnapping , sexual assault , assault , domestic violence and drug trafficking , should be ineligible for conditional sentencing . 
a recent survey of 450 Canadian judges revealed that 80 % of them were leery of imposing conditional sentences due to lack of supervision . 
if a child commits a violent crime and causes pain and hardship for another person , what lesson is learned from being grounded ? 
we are not talking about a minor incident of shoplifting or a minor incident of vandalism , perhaps by a temporary wayward child . 
we are talking about serious crimes . 
being grounded is effectively what a conditional sentence is because it limits freedom . 
that is all it does . 
how can those who have been injured by a youth feel justified if the offender is allowed to go home and play Nintendo or watch television ? 
what about other youth who see the lenient sentence handed down to their friend for hurting someone else ? 
what have they learned ? 
will they consider the consequences prior to committing a crime ? 
the answer is no , because that is what the YOA did and that is what Bill C - 3 will continue . 
it will not change that . 
the minister must learn from the mistakes of conditional sentencing for adults and ensure that those mistakes are not repeated with our youth through the legislation . 
i want to move on to the minister ' s actions . 
the justice minister was appointed 864 days ago when she stated that the overhauling of the Young Offenders Act was her top priority and that changes were to be made in a timely fashion . 
the bill is on pace to hit 1,000 days . 
i guess we should all be thankful that this is her priority . 
the figure of 864 days seems like a pretty obscure one and it does not mean much . 
it is just a statistic . 
what significance does it serve ? 
in the 864 days Canadians have been waiting for new youth crime legislation , which they were hoping would include deterrents , over 30,000 violent crimes have left more than 30,000 victims in their wake . 
that is about 34 violent crimes per day and unfortunately Bill C - 3 , about which the government is so busy bragging , misses the mark and provides little in terms of real solutions like most justice initiatives of the government . 
in order for Bill C - 3 to be deemed a success it must stand up to one test , and one test only : 
does it address the concerns of Canadians ? 
i will run through them again . 
No. Are violent criminals removed from society ? 
not likely . 
some . 
at the discretion of the courts they may . 
will the names of violent and sexual assault criminals be published ? 
maybe . 
are the rights of victims paramount to those of criminals ? 
No. They are not . 
in conclusion , I am informing the House that the official opposition is , reluctantly I might add because we have waited as long as Canadians have waited for the legislation , unable to support the bill without serious amendments . 
our members on the justice committee will be moving amendments that are in the best interest of public safety , deterrence and rehabilitation respectively . 
i can just hear the minister in future question periods when asked why violent young criminals are still out reoffending due to lenient sentencing . 
the minister will probably say something like the government made significant changes to Canada ' s youth justice system but the Reform Party voted against them . 
let me set the record straight right at the outset . 
bill C - 3 is deeply flawed . 
it is not good enough for Canadians who have waited so long . 
the legislation does not go far enough to protect society . 
it does not include any measures to ensure mandatory participation in meaningful rehabilitation programs . 
the minister again has brought forward a bill that is full of loopholes and allows lawyers and judges to maintain the status quo when it comes to youth justice . 
status quo is not what Canadians were hoping or praying for in the area of youth justice . 
in summary , Bill C - 3 is not good enough . 
it is not good enough for the Reform Party of Canada . 
it is not good enough for Canadians , and most important it is not good enough for our youth who cried out the loudest for change . 
bill C - 3 is simply not good enough . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the whole issue of young offenders is extremely important , because everyone knows that young people will eventually be part of society . 
this is why the Bloc Quebecois has paid keen attention to everything surrounding the debates on the Young Offenders Act . 
it has repeatedly called on the minister not to touch the bill , which works successfully in Quebec . 
i will explain that in detail in the time allotted me . 
i am going to try to prove that it is a good law , that it must not be touched and that it must simply be implemented as Quebec has done since its passage . 
the results in Quebec have been very good . 
i think everyone in this House agrees with that . 
even the former Minister of Justice acknowledged this at a first ministers conference . 
i will speak of that in a few minutes . 
i listened with much interest to the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice - I find it all odd that the minister did not come to the House to defend the bill herself at second reading , instead of her parliamentary secretary - but I think he has failed to grasp the problem . 
the government seems to have understood nothing of Quebec ' s approach . 
worse yet , the parliamentary secretary is quoting people from the Institut Pinel , who have said repeatedly they do not want Bill C - 3 , or Bill C - 68 , as it was called during the previous session . 
the parliamentary secretary quotes people from the Institut Pinel . 
one has to be in a really difficult situation to have to quote people opposed to this bill in order to sell it in this House . 
i also listened with interest to the comments made by the Reform Party . 
true to their vision of justice and to everything they have done since 1993 , Reformers unfortunately gave a twisted picture of the situation . 
the Reform Party member called upon God and prayed . 
he does not want his children to get attacked by young people , and so on . 
this is a very negative and demagogic speech , one that should not be made here on legislation on young offenders . 
to make such remarks is to mislead the public . 
these comments do not reflect the actual figures , which are not those of the Bloc Quebecois nor of the Government of Quebec , but those of the federal government and they show that the crime rate is declining among young people . 
in English Canada , the further west we go , the higher the rate of recidivism and the percentage of young offenders . 
this is interesting , because application existing Young Offenders Act is less consistent as we move from east to west in English Canada , and least of all in the west . 
strange as it may seem , under the Liberals ' current system , the less a province applies the Young Offenders Act , the more money it gets . 
i will get back to this later on . 
there is a bill that has been outstanding for years for which the government opposite has not reimbursed the Government of Quebec . 
the Government of Quebec has decided to invest in people , and particularly in young people so that they can regain their anonymity as quickly as possible on leaving custody and become full - fledged members of society , while westerners are investing in concrete . 
the way the program is set up , the folks investing in concrete and prisons in which to hold young offenders as long as possible get money from the federal government , while those who enforce the legislation passed by the federal government , the government opposite , are penalized . 
i can see why the former Minister of Justice did not keep his post for long : he supported the Government of Quebec ' s claim . 
i will come back to this a bit later . 
to conclude my remarks about what the previous speaker said , I would like him to take a closer look at the statistics . 
i would like him to take a closer look at what is going on in his immediate surroundings and try to depersonalize the debate , look at objective figures . 
let him come to Quebec and see what is going on . 
let him talk to people like those at the Institut Pinel . 
let him read what eminent criminologists and university professors have written . 
let him observe the approach taken by crown lawyers in cases . 
let him examine the results in Quebec . 
i am certain that he will see that the approach he is recommending is not the right one . 
that having been said , I will develop my argument further . 
i will begin with an extremely important quotation , just to make the point that it is not only recently that Quebec has been addressing the issue of young offenders . 
i refer to the report by Justice Jasmin addressing the young offender issue . 
his report was released in 1995 . 
the debate has been going on for some time . 
today we are discussing Bill C - 3 , which was numbered C - 68 during the last session . 
i have a great deal to say and I doubt 40 minutes would be enough . 
i will try to give hon. members the main thrust . 
the quote I am about to read from the Jasmin report fits in very well with today ' s debate . 
he writes : 
it is often easier to amend legislation than to change our approach to a problem . 
simplistic responses blind us to the full extent of complex problems and create the false impression that we are doing what is necessary to resolve them . 
one such simplistic response is substituting get - tough measures for educational approaches . 
this loses sight of the fact that adolescents are still in the process of evolving and laying the entire blame for their delinquency at their door is implying that society and their environment were of no importance . 
it was no weak conclusion that Mr. Justice Jasmin reached following his consultations . 
i think society is responsible for that somehow . 
i am not saying that society must assume all the blame . 
when we look at the case a little , when we see a 14 year old or 15 year old committing such a crime - repugnant , I agree - when we look at this young person ' s situation , level of education , community and friends , we realize quite often that the parents are totally absent , . 
we realize that the young person has committed a very serious crime but is not the only one responsible . 
in the short term perhaps . 
a 14 year old going to prison will be released one day , but the problem will not be resolved when that young person comes out . 
unfortunately , this is the approach advocated by the Reform members and , very disappointingly , no doubt in order to garner a few votes in the upcoming elections in Alberta , represented by the Minister of Justice , the minister gave in to the very right wing demands of the Reform Party . 
as far as justice is concerned and especially as far as young offenders are concerned , Reformers and Liberals are tarred with the same brush . 
it makes no sense . 
earlier , I said that this was not the first time we have debated this bill , because it was first introduced by the Minister of Justice on March 11 , 1999 as Bill C - 68 . 
immediately after the bill was introduced , just reading the preamble and the first few clauses I felt that a major amendment was called for and that the government was tearing down huge portions of the Young Offenders Act , when there was nothing wrong with it . 
it brought out quotes from the former Minister of Justice in the same Liberal government to show that there had been a change in approach and that what one minister had said was plainly contradicted by his successor . 
i would have thought the Minister of Justice would have given this issue some thought over the summer , because it is without a doubt one of the most important bills she will introduce in this parliament . 
what is passed today will affect generations to come . 
we cannot amend the Young Offenders Act every six months , or whenever the government appoints a new justice minister . 
this is probably the most important bill that the hon. member will introduce in her capacity as Minister of Justice . 
i thought , wrongly , that the summer vacation would help the minister come to her senses . 
nothing is changed in this legislation , even though many people clearly showed that it should be amended and even withdrawn , so that the current Young Offenders Act would remain in effect . 
i told members that , as early as in March , April and May 1999 , people in Quebec were unanimous in their opposition . 
in fact , I challenge the government to quote or to name a single Quebec organization applying the Young Offenders Act on a daily basis that supports the amendments proposed by the minister . 
criminologists , social workers , police forces , legal experts , everyone is saying that the minister is headed in the wrong direction . 
in Quebec , opposition is significant . 
it is very significant within the provincial government and I believe it will grow even more in the next few days . 
it may be that we have to send an even stronger message to the federal government . 
the Liberals may not have got it the first time . 
i am told that , while opposition voiced in Quebec and the message sent by the coalition against the reform of the Young Offenders Act was ignored by the Minister of Justice and the Quebec Liberal caucus , it was well received by certain groups outside Quebec . 
opposition to this bill is increasing , not for the reasons advanced by the Reform Party but for the ones advanced by the Quebec coalition , which is against the amendments the minister proposes to make in this important area . 
when a minister decides to intervene in something , no doubt this is because he feels justified in doing so . 
i indicated earlier that there had been a drop in the crime rate . 
the intention of the bill before us is not to amend the Young Offenders Act . 
i say this because there are still members on the government side who maintain it is so . 
they say " The bill before you , members of the Opposition , is a bill to amend the Young Offenders Act '' . 
this is not true . 
bill C - 3 repeals the existing young offenders legislation . 
it starts completely from scratch . 
the government ought perhaps to acknowledge this . 
regarding the Young Offenders Act as it is applied today - and I cannot get into it clause by clause because it is a highly complex piece of legislation - but I think that the hon. members will understand clearly why we are opposed , just from its main thrust , its main principles and orientations . 
at the present time , it is section 3 of the Young Offenders Act in its present form - all judges up to and including the justices of the Supreme Court agree on this - that shows the true policy thrust the legislator wished to give to the legislation and what he intends to do with young people in conflict with the law . 
section 3 is very long and I will not read it in full , but I will read some of the principles by which a judge must be guided when he hands down a decision involving a young offender . 
this section says : 
crime prevention is essential to the long - term protection of society and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young persons . 
it goes on to say : 
b ) Society must , although it has the responsibility to take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons , be afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour ; 
it is not true to say that the purpose of the present act is not to protect society . 
in the first three paragraphs of section 3 , that is most certainly put forward as its purpose . 
this section also says : 
" special needs " is an extremely important phrase in section 3 ( c ) on which many judges , including those in the supreme court , have commented , pointing out that Quebec approached things differently by taking into account the special needs required in a given situation . 
it also says , and I quote : 
the protection of society , which is a primary objective of the criminal law applicable to youth , is best served by rehabilitation . 
i hope that members opposite , including the parliamentary secretary who is paying close attention to my comments , realize that the existing act , passed by this government , provides that the social rehabilitation of young offenders is preferable to any other measure . 
this is what the current act says . 
and so on . 
these are extremely important provisions . 
does Bill C - 3 include anything similar ? 
as members know , a bill is made up of a title , sections , parts and schedules . 
the content of the act itself is more important than what is found in the explanatory notes or in the preamble . 
the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled on this issue and stated that while the preamble provides guidelines , one must look at the wording of the act itself . 
none of what I read , which comes from the declaration of principle found in section 3 of the existing Young Offenders Act , is to be found in Bill C - 3 , which is before us today . 
instead , the government has included , probably to keep people quiet , a vague reference to these principles in the preamble of its proposed legislation . 
it is as if it were saying " Come on , you folks in the Bloc Quebecois , the principles are there in the preamble '' . 
it is a meaningless sham . 
the judges will have to interpret it , that is certain , but they will do so according to what is in the legislation . 
it can be seen , then , that there is a considerable difference between the two texts , the current Young Offenders Act and the bill we have before us . 
another argument that is often raised by those on the other side of the House is flexibility . 
the Minister of Justice , or her department , has managed to cast a spell over a number of the Quebec Liberal MPs , or maybe the Prime Minister himself , since he must have had a hand in it all . 
they , because there is more than one , have told me " What are you complaining about ? 
yet , upon examination , we find there is no flexibility . 
i have gone through the bill more than once . 
however , there is an indication that , under some circumstances , it could be done on a case by case basis . 
that is not funny . 
the minister can do what she wants with the bill , may I say , because she is introducing it , but she will not be applying it . 
that will be left to the provinces . 
she is putting undue pressure on the crown attorneys who are going to evaluate , in each case , whether they will treat the young person as an adult or as a young person , who is therefore not fully responsible for his actions and deserves special attention . 
the Minister of Justice is not going to be the one to carry this burden . 
the Minister of Justice of this " beautiful , great , finest country in the world " known as Canada is not going to feel the pressure , but Quebecers will , because they will be implementing this law in Quebec . 
with all the demagoguery I am hearing today , it will be easy to get a crowd together and put huge pressure on the crown attorney who will have a given case , who will have to draw conclusions , who will have to make recommendations . 
i think the minister lacks courage . 
if she wants to act this way , let her take on the burden and insist that young people in specific situations be treated as adults . 
she should not put that burden on the shoulders of one or more others . 
she should say so clearly , which she has not done in her bill . 
there is also the whole principle of our not living in a closed society in Quebec . 
even if we wanted - something I wish with all my heart - Quebec to be able to do as it wished in all areas , including justice , because we would be sovereign , we must for the time being live with the tools we are given . 
Quebecers must live with legislation passed by the Parliament of Canada . 
they cannot completely shut it out of and say " We will have nothing to do with what is going on in English Canada concerning the implementation of the new act '' . 
it refers to " criminal justice '' . 
whatever happened to the guiding principle of the Young Offenders Act ? 
we will not be able to remain silent . 
we will not be able to say that we will completely ignore what is going on . 
the lower and upper courts in the other provinces will interpret this legislation . 
indeed , the imposition of similar sentences is also a principle included in the new legislation . 
what does it mean ? 
does it mean that Quebec will have to impose a jail sentence on a young offender because Ontario does it ? 
what does it mean in concrete terms ? 
frankly , this is a useless and dangerous bill . 
it provides for harsher sentences . 
the government obviously decided to crack down on young offenders , but this bill does not reflect today ' s reality . 
let us take something else that is completely ridiculous , the publication of names . 
in what way will publishing the names of young offenders in newspapers help their victims ? 
how will it advance the justice system to brand these young people for life ? 
there are no studies indicating that it would do any good to make their names public . 
there are no experts who think that publishing names will in any way reduce crime . 
i have never heard anyone say " I think that victims would feel better if they saw the name of the 14 - year old who attacked them , raped them or killed someone ' s child in big letters in the newspaper . 
i think it would do me good . 
i think it would help me to get through all this '' . 
the ones pushing for this are the ones looking for sensationalism , the ones looking for easy votes on the backs of those dealing with these situations . 
what I fail to understand is that the so - called Liberal government across the way has decided to go along with them and allow the publication of names for certain crimes , specific ones I admit . 
this is completely unnecessary . 
let us look at the cost of a radical change in approach where young offenders are concerned . 
even the minister admits that the reform she is proposing in Bill C - 3 will involve additional costs . 
even the Department of Justice is prepared to pay , since the government is getting tough and it looks good . 
how it is perceived by the public is more important than whether the public ' s real interests are being served . 
it is so easy to use a bill like this one for political gain . 
i do not support that . 
i believe there is a better way of doing things . 
the federal government owes the Government of Quebec the tidy sum of $ 87 million , because the Young Offenders Act is being enforced in Quebec and prisons are not being built as they are in western Canada . 
the former Minister of Justice acknowledged at a federal - provincial conference of ministers of justice that the federal government owed Quebec money . 
the government ought to give some thought to paying us . 
it ought to think about writing us a cheque before it starts investing new money in a piece of legislation no one in Quebec wants . 
we believe that we are helping young people by investing in them when they are having problems with the law . 
when they are given help , I believe that 90 % or 95 % of them go back to being regular members of society , after their release . 
there are very few repeat offences when the young people have properly followed the mandatory plan mapped out for them , when they have had the proper follow - up by specialists . 
since my time is getting very short , I will address my remarks particularly to all the Quebec members of this House sitting on the government benches . 
why are they not opposing this ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
i must remind the hon. member that we do not speak of the absence or presence of members in the House . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
madam Speaker , I think you perhaps missed this subtlety of the French language . 
it means : where do they stand with respect to this bill and not whether they are in the House or not . 
i know ; you did not need to remind me , but I hope that you will give me back the few moments you took away from me . 
where do these members stand ? 
why do they not rise to criticize this bill ? 
the member for Brome - Missisquoi , a member from Quebec and the former president of the Quebec bar association , which is supposed to represent its members properly , where does he stand ? 
i will close very succinctly , by listing the persons or groups who have spoken out in Quebec against this bill : the Commission des services juridiques , the Conseil permanent de la jeunesse , the É cole de criminologie of the University of Montreal represented by Jean Tr é panier , Aide communautaire juridique de Montr é al , the Fondation qu é b é coise pour les jeunes contrevenants . 
the Institut Pinel , quoted by the parliamentary secretary in support of his bill , spoke out strongly against it . 
the police chiefs ' association , the Conf é rences des R é gies r é gionales de la sant é , the Association des centres jeunesse du Qu é bec , the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse , the Quebec Crown Prosecutors ' Office , the Association des CLSC et CHLSD du Qu é bec , l 'É cole de psycho é ducation de l ' Universit é de Montr é al , the Regroupement des organismes de justice alternative du Qu é bec , the Ligue pour le bien - ê tre de l ' enfance du Canada , the Canadian Criminal Justice Association , the Association des avocats de la d é fense du Qu é bec , the Soci é t é de criminologie du Qu é bec , not to mention the Government of Quebec and all the judges who , through the messages they are sending , stress the merits of the current Young Offenders Act . 
in conclusion , I move : 
that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word " That " and substituting the following : 
" bill C - 3 , An Act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other Acts , be not now read a second time but that the Order be discharged , the Bill withdrawn and the subject - matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights . " 
the government must go back to the drawing board . 
it must do its homework and consult , among others , the Government of Quebec , which has been asking for weeks to meet with officials from the Department of Justice . 
the Minister of Justice must also realize that things are done differently in Quebec , and she must come to her senses . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
in my opinion , the amendment is in order . 
debate is now on the proposed amendment . 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , after the passionate comments of my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois and his reference to the demagoguery of the Reform Party , I am afraid my salty comments from the east coast may not be quite so dramatic . 
i do think it is important that we reflect upon the nature and the reasons for the introduction of the new youth criminal justice act . 
it was stated by a member earlier that the old Young Offenders Act was appropriate , that it worked well in Quebec . 
i concur with the member . 
i think he is right . 
i think Quebec took the Young Offenders Act when it was introduced , applied it in the way it was to be applied , spent the resources in the areas where they needed to be spent and showed how that act could work . 
unfortunately other provinces did not have the resources , or chose not to implement the Young Offenders Act in the same way . 
i say that having had some experience with it . 
i began my career as a lawyer just as the Young Offenders Act was introduced and became law . 
i can say unequivocally that in the province where I practised it was an exercise in frustration to appear day after day in the courts with young people charged under the Young Offenders Act . 
it was an exercise in frustration for the judiciary who did not have access to the types of programs the Young Offenders Act envisioned . 
it was an exercise in frustration for the crown . 
it was an exercise in frustration for the defence counsel , to say nothing of the frustration felt by both the families of the young offenders and the victims of crime . 
as we approach a new piece of legislation it is important that we examine whether or not that legislation can correct some of the problems that have arisen over the last few years . 
i do note that this legislation is now Bill C - 3 . 
it was Bill C - 68 in the last parliament . 
perhaps the government changed the numbering because it always seems to have problems with bills numbered C - 68 . 
the symbol of justice is the scales of justice . 
they are an important symbol for a number of reasons . 
they indicate the need for balance . 
they indicate the need to balance the rights of the accused against the rights of society . 
they indicate the need to balance what goes on in the courtroom against what is perhaps demanded by society . 
justice and crime affect all communities and all the people in those communities . 
children are a responsibility . 
all of society has a role in the upbringing and concern for our young people . 
when we deal with a bill that affects justice , crime and children , that bill requires careful examination by those people who represent all of the people in this country . 
there are some things in the bill which I wish to address . 
i should point out this is the third time I have addressed this piece of legislation in some depth . 
the legislation will continue to apply to young offenders between the ages of 12 and 18 years . 
there was some call for the bill to apply to children who were 10 and 11 years old . 
i say unequivocally that is not the position of the New Democratic Party . 
we believe that for children who are 10 or 11 years old the appropriate place to deal with them when they do not follow the rules of society , when they appear to be misled , is through social services and help to the family by the community . 
i am glad to see that the Minister of Justice listened to those many groups who came before the justice committee , of which I am a member , and argued that the law not apply to 10 and 11 year old children . 
it would be interesting to contrast that with the children ' s agenda in the Speech from the Throne which we heard two weeks ago the focus of which was on children . 
to somehow say that 10 and 11 year old children have the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong in the way that we demand of those who are charged with criminal offences is a stretch . 
the Minister of Justice listened to those groups and I can say that we concur . 
there is an emphasis on prevention and alternatives to jail for non - violent offenders . 
they are found at clauses 4 and 5 of the proposed legislation . 
those too are appropriate issues for the minister to introduce . 
there is no need to clog the courts up with these kinds of offences when we have serious matters that have to go before the courts . 
we applaud the sections of the act that provide for cautioning by police and for the exercise of discretion by those in authority . 
it increases the emphasis on community based sentencing with which we concur . 
there are some other areas that are perhaps more contentious and some areas that require further debate and examination . 
there is a reverse onus in the legislation on young people between the ages of 14 and 17 years who are charged with serious violent offences . 
when I say there is a reverse onus I mean for particular prescribed offences these young people will be tried as adults unless they can prove to the court that they should not be . 
that is a fundamental change from the other Young Offenders Act where the burden was on the state to prove that the young person should be tried as an adult . 
it places a reverse onus on young people to make the case that they should not be . 
it is a heavy and onerous burden . 
when we talk about resources to the provinces one thing we have to think about is that the young person is also given the right to counsel in the legislation . 
that is appropriate . 
it is very difficult for an adult lay person to argue a reverse onus without legal counsel , let alone a 15 year old . 
if we are to ensure that a young person has the right to counsel it begs the question who will pay for it . 
where is counsel to come from ? 
we see the beginnings of what flows through the act and that is a downloading of costs on to the provinces . 
while there is some contribution by the federal government toward legal aid programs across the country , we can see that the role of legal aid lawyers will increase dramatically with the legislation and its reverse onus , and that will be a further cost to the provinces . 
we have to examine that very carefully . 
in addition , there is a provision that requires some other consideration , and that is special sentencing for young people who suffer severe psychological problems . 
we have to question whether or not the place for people who have severe psychological problems is in the courts in the first place . 
we do not have a problem with the publication of names of young offenders convicted of serious offences unless a judge determines otherwise . 
the public has called for and demanded that in some situations the names of young offenders be published so the community and other young people will know if there is a serious offender among them . 
my party and I concur with that . 
members of the Reform Party objected to the minister ' s comments when she said " in certain circumstances '' . 
the act provides for some judicial discretion in that regard . 
in reality we have to provide some discretion to the courts . 
we cannot foresee each case that will come before a court . 
that is why we have judges . 
if it were easy to say that every person charged with this crime will face this penalty , we would not need the judiciary . 
within parameters the court needs some discretion on how it deals with offenders , especially young offenders . 
in terms of the publication of names each case will require certain thoughts , which may well be best left to the judge who hears the case . 
that is why the discretion is there and why we would consider it important . 
they do not understand their rights in the many ways adults do . 
we must be somewhat careful when we make a determination of a confession given to a person in authority . 
the way it worked under the old act was that any statement to a person in authority , whether or not a police officer , had to be examined very carefully by the court . 
we will examine that very carefully . 
i began by talking about the right to counsel of the young person and the downloading of that cost on to the provinces . 
i am afraid that many of the positive aspects of the legislation , and there are some , will simply not be affordable for the provinces . 
i am afraid we will make the same mistake with this legislation that we made when the Young Offenders Act was introduced . 
this act provides even more methods of dealing with young people . 
i have mentioned police discretion and community sentencing are good ideas but they cost money . 
let us be frank . 
to have special sentencing provisions for young people who suffer from psychological problems will cost money . 
unfortunately many people do not realize that the cost of the administration of justice falls to the provinces . 
for a province like Nova Scotia , which faces a huge deficit and has just cancelled programs for charities , it is questionable whether or not it will have the funds to prepare for some of the positive aspects of the legislation . 
the Minister of Justice and the government will say that they have committed funding to help the provinces , that they have committed $ 206 million . 
what they do not say is that it is over a number of years . 
it is not in one year that $ 206 million will be given . 
there is no clear indication of how that funding will be distributed across the country . 
i have made this statement before . 
the last time I spoke to the legislation I indicated my concern was that the $ 206 million committed by the government were not enough , especially if we looked at it on a per capita basis . 
if the money is to be distributed to the provinces on a per capita basis , it will mean very insignificant funds for provinces with smaller populations and there will not be enough funds that are necessary to fulfil the purposes of the act . 
again we will have an act that will frustrate the victims , the judiciary , the families of young offenders and counsel . 
my party and I have some concerns about other aspects of the act . 
i will indicate to the House some of the statistics . 
right now provinces are paying upward of 70 % of the costs of administering the youth justice system . 
as we implement a more complex system with wider parameters those costs will escalate and the provinces will have a very heavy burden in trying to fulfil their responsibilities under the act . 
there are other areas that cause us some concern . 
life sentences for youth convicted in adult court give me some concern . 
i know I differ from my colleagues in the Reform Party on this point , but we have to wonder whether or not sentencing young people to a full life sentence will ever serve to rehabilitate them . 
my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois said that the prisons are our training schools for further crime . 
we know that . 
it has been said that it is not the role of the justice system to deal with social problems . 
when we deal with young people in particular we cannot divorce the two . 
it is no accident when we look at jails , especially those south of the border , that they are full of people from poor sections of the United States , especially minority groups . 
it is no accident that our prison populations have a greater proportion of aboriginal people who come from poor reserves . 
we cannot address the problems of dealing with crime unless we can also deal with what causes crime . 
the prevention of crime should be our ultimate goal . 
clearly , when someone breaks the law and commits a heinous crime , it has to be dealt with swiftly , in a meaningful way as stated in the act and in some cases severely . 
however we cannot say there is no room for social issues in justice issues . 
the two are so inextricably linked that it is almost impossible to talk about one and not the other . 
we have to recognize the groups such as the Church Council on Justice and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs that appeared before the justice committee . 
they have been mentioned in the Quebec context by my colleague from the Bloc . 
all of them had recommendations . 
they had my word , and I think the word of members of the justice committee , that we would take into account their concerns when we examined the bill . 
i also want to say that the provinces addressed concerns to the Minister of Justice which have not been addressed . 
we will now have an opportunity to see how Manitoba responds to this with its new government , which has expressed concerns about youth gangs , about young people 10 and 11 who were coerced into crime and how we could best deal with them . 
i can indicate at this point , given the costs associated with the program and the inability to implement it because of funding , that we have serious questions about supporting the legislation . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) : 
i sat on the justice committee with him for a short time and I was always impressed with his clarity of thought , although at times we differ from a political point of view . 
he touched upon the fact that we cannot separate the role of the justice system from dysfunctional families and the problems in society that lead to youth crime . 
i would like to ask the hon. member this question . 
if poverty contributes to youth crime , inasmuch as we have seen , according to the statistics , that there has been a dramatic increase in youth poverty since the Liberal government took over in 1993 , does he suggest that the policies of the government have contributed to the extent to which youth crime has either grown or remained constant during this period of time ? 
Mr. Peter Mancini : 
madam Speaker , I would be happy to respond to the question . 
as indicated by the hon. member for Crowfoot , we did work together on the justice committee . 
in fact , I remember us having a debate , I think at the University of Ottawa , on the proposed legislation . 
i think it is helpful to always hear two sides of the argument . 
when I talk about a balanced approach , I like to think that sometimes we manage to find that ground . 
he raises an important question . 
we know that the economic policies implemented by the government have resulted in more children and more families in this country living in poverty than was the situation when the government took office . 
we know that despite a pledge to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000 , in fact the gap between the haves and the have nots has increased . 
when I talk about poverty and community , I mean more than simply ensuring that all children have the same material goods . 
i would like to talk about what is happening in my part of the country , which I think is happening in other parts of the country as well . 
if we look at children and children who are at risk of committing crime , the most important thing we can do is to make sure that they have a sense of community and community values . 
if children belong to a community , then they respect that community . 
children need to have a sense of place , a sense of connectedness to place and they need to have a sense of history . 
we know that in the maritimes and I think other communities know it as well . 
children in my community know who their grandfather and their great grandfather was and they have an extended family . 
while they may not have all the material things that are necessary , they have that sense of value from the community . 
there are two kinds of poverty . 
there is the poverty that happens to a child when they are deprived of their community and their community values . 
there are also the material things . 
there are children who live without adequate shelter . 
we know that homelessness is increasing in this country . 
there are children who live without adequate food . 
i commend my colleague , the member for Crowfoot , who introduced a motion concerning headstart programs to make sure that children in this country have breakfast before they go to school . 
we know that without those things children have no reason to have input into their community . 
why would they respect the laws and values of the community if the community does not respect the needs and requirements of those children ? 
they are linked , and I thank the hon. member for the question . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I am the next speaker , so I will ask a brief question . 
i would address it to my colleague and fellow Nova Scotian . 
i have listened very closely to his remarks . 
as well , the intervention by my friend , the member for Crowfoot , was very timely and well placed . 
i embrace much of what the hon. member said when he spoke of the feeling of disconnected children in the country , in particular in places that he is familiar with , the maritimes , where there is a transitional way of life that often leads families to move elsewhere , to uproot from their communities , perhaps in the hope of returning some day . 
this often leaves children drifting . 
we know as well that the commentary with respect to the economic impact on those who get involved in criminal activity is very real . 
however , without the resources it is going to be virtually impossible . 
my friend touched on this in some detail in his speech . 
it appears to me that this legislation , as well intended as it may be , is simply going to further download the responsibilities that are already being carried by the existing agencies . 
it is going to put further pressure on these agencies , which are currently underfunded . 
we know , and the hon. member touched on it , that the legislation does not carry with it sufficient financial backing to accomplish all of these wonderful goals and these airy principles that are to be accomplished . 
would my hon. friend comment on that ? 
Mr. Peter Mancini : 
madam Speaker , I will be as brief in my response as my colleague was in his question , because I know he is speaking next and I am always anxious to hear what he has to say . 
let me give an illustration as to where the funding might be placed . 
community group after community group has come to see me in my office with ideas on how to deal with the issues of youth crime . 
they have put forward all kinds of plans , some of which I have given to the minister of justice , dealing with youth centres . 
unfortunately , as money dries up there are real questions as to whether that can continue . 
those would be some of the programs which I think would help at the community level to deter crime . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I am extremely pleased to rise to speak to Bill C - 3 . 
i am pleased as well that the reconvening of parliament and the gathering of members of parliament back to this place will allow us to continue the debate of the Liberal government ' s youth criminal justice act , now known as Bill C - 3 , formerly Bill C - 68 , which was another poorly put together bill . 
the proposed replacement of the current Young Offenders Act is one which has received a great deal of attention , and rightly so , and a great deal of consternation throughout the country . 
it will be an entirely new piece of legislation that pertains specifically to youth in this country . 
youth justice is certainly a matter of great concern for all Canadians , for the Progressive Conservative Party , the government and all opposition parties . 
in my riding of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough I hear regularly from people who are affected and who are extremely concerned about the direction in which youth criminal justice is going in this country . 
i also find that the concern that is expressed very often by the government has resulted in an extremely lengthy waiting period with respect to the introduction of this legislation . 
we know that it was throughout many election campaigns a priority that was spelled out in documents . 
however , it took the government 18 months before first introducing this bill in its original form , Bill C - 68 . 
with much fanfare , in March 1999 the bill was finally tabled by the minister of justice . 
we also know , as is very often the practice , that much of it had been media tested and leaked prior to its introduction here in the House , or I should say its introduction through the press gallery . 
then , on the eve of parliament reconvening this fall , there was a prorogation . 
this delayed the opening of the House by three weeks and we know that there were huge issues burning in the country at the time : the proposed hostile takeover , the fisheries crisis that is absolutely a tinderbox which is about to explode on the east coast , as well as the refugee crisis . 
we also know that there are problems within our justice system . 
it is absolutely shameful that the government again chose to delay dealing with problems which I have mentioned , as well as the introduction of this very necessary legislation . 
one would have thought that throughout the summer months of reflection this might have prompted the minister of justice to strengthen or perhaps revise some of the act . 
bill C - 3 is the mirror image of Bill C - 68 , but for the fact that the justice department did , in fairness , go through the problem of spell - check to correct some of the language so that at least the French and English languages correspond . 
we have waited an eternity for Bill C - 3 , but it is , we are quick to acknowledge in the Conservative Party , an attempt to replace what was a very ineffective and in many instances a very dangerous piece of legislation . 
i am talking about the former Young Offenders Act . 
i say with all honesty that this is not the case . 
that is not to say that simply toughening up the act is going to address the problems that exist with youth crime in this country . 
that is not to say that there are not any positive elements in this bill . 
in fairness , all opposition members and government members who have preceded me in speaking in this debate have indicated that there are indeed some very positive elements in Bill C - 3 . 
these are not new nuances . 
these are not changes that have not been contemplated in the past . 
in fact I find it almost ironic that much of what we are talking about in this debate is actually a return to philosophies and methodologies in the criminal justice system that we have used in the past under previous legislation such as the juvenile offenders act , legislation which has come full circle now in terms of how we react to young persons who become involved in criminal activity . 
there is certainly one very positive element of this bill that I would be quick to recognize and that is the concept of parental responsibility . 
this bill attempts to bring adults , and parents specifically , more into the system . 
one can agree very quickly that this is a necessary element . 
there has to be a more holistic approach , a family style approach , to the problems that often lead up to and continue to exist when a young person runs afoul of the law . 
this degree of accountability , not only for the young person but for the parent , is crucial in addressing youth crime . 
it is a fair question , I suggest , for a judge to ask a parent in a courtroom in an open fashion , " Where were you when your 14 year old was breaking into your neighbour ' s house ? 
why was your child out on a school night under the influence of alcohol or drugs committing a criminal offence ? 
why is your child acting out in such a violent way ? " 
these are relevant questions , and questions that I feel a parent should be held to account for as well . 
the entire issue of the age of accountability is something that is dodged by this particular piece of legislation . 
i am quick to point out that it is a suggestion that has been certainly echoed by members of the opposition , but it originated in a report that was commissioned by the government itself . 
this was an idea that was not just floated by opposition members and it is not just an attempt I suggest to try to find fault with the act . 
this was a recommendation by an expert under the financial auspices of the government . 
it raises the hackles on the necks of government members when they hear the suggestion , and they point out that we already have many agencies in place to address youth under the age of 12 who are not encompassed by the old act or the new act , that these agencies are the ones most properly suited to deal with youth in contravention of the law . 
however , I am very quick to remind the government and the House that the legislation does not bolster the support that is needed in the areas of child welfare and early intervention . 
there are an increasing number of youth under the age of 12 who are completely untouched by our criminal justice system . 
it is the rapid response , I would suggest , that is most important in dealing with crime at an early age , and allowing our criminal justice system to react . 
this is not a bar on placing children into those agencies . 
we already know that our justice system works very much hand in glove with those social services , with those agencies . 
police officers are often faced with an extremely frustrating situation where an 11 or sometimes even a 10 year old - and it seems unthinkable but it does happen on occasion - is involved in a very serious offence perhaps involving a weapon , perhaps involving threats or a violent act . 
under the current system and under the system that the new legislation will put in place , police officers are virtually powerless . 
they can contact the agencies , but they do not have at their discretion the same elements that would exist under the criminal law . 
this is one of the many reasons that I have introduced a private member ' s bill that would do just that . 
i know other members of the House have some reservations about this , but it is not solely to hammer youth under the age of 12 . It is simply to widen the net , to broaden what the act encompasses . 
if there are positive elements , and there certainly are positive elements in the act , why would we not want to have those early interventions , those elements that will hopefully focus our attention on the root problems of crime , applied to a broader age group of young people in the country ? 
there are other sections of the act that I would like to address as well . 
bill C - 3 certainly does not address the financial responsibilities that are also encompassed by the administration of criminal law in the country , and that is true of the old act . 
it has been declining since 1984 . 
it has been getting steadily worse when it comes to the federal government ' s commitment to the provinces and the administration of criminal law in the country . 
i am not going to broaden that by discussing criminal law generally , but with respect to the administration of the Young Offenders Act , the federal government has completely abrogated its responsibility in holding up its financial end of the deal . 
that is true in the province of Quebec , Nova Scotia and right across the country . 
this is something I know the province of Quebec , in many instances , has focused its attention on . 
it has in fact initiated more programs and put more provincial funding into it , perhaps at the expense of other programming , because it recognizes the importance of it . 
the province of Quebec is perhaps a leader in many of the areas of programming that the government envisions will be brought about as a result of changes in the act . 
bill C - 3 gives the provinces increased responsibilities ; they will have to offer with more programs and become more involved in the administration of this legislation . 
for now , there is no new funding in sight from the federal government . 
intervention at the earliest possible juncture is the most effective way to get youth back on track before its too late . 
the government says that it will do this with the new bill and , to an extent , it does focus its attention on that area of the law . 
clause 34 , for example , is the medical and psychological report clause to determine if a youth is in fact suffering from some affliction or disorders that need to be treated and not necessarily punished . 
this is not a new concept . 
this commitment is what are needed . 
this is where the focus has to be . 
what the act does , in simple terms , is to identify the problem as a priority and drop it in the provinces ' lap and walk away . 
that is simply not good enough . 
young females in conflict with the law is a rising problem in the country . 
there was a very serious case that drew a great deal of attention across the country involving a young woman named Reena Virk in the province of British Columbia . 
this again is something that is highlighted across the country . 
young women are becoming more increasingly involved in the criminal justice system as a result of many of the other social problems that exist . 
philosophically , members of the House would agree that that it is the right approach . 
however , the government is not putting in place the resources that are necessary . 
it has identified what it wants to do . 
it has made a great deal of fanfare and drawn a great deal of attention to itself as having brought this bold new initiative about , yet it is not prepared to pony up and pay for the programming that is going to be necessary . 
the difficulty itself is a very complex one . 
sometimes in this place we suffer from oversimplification in telling people what they want to hear . 
this is not a problem that is going to go away quickly . 
because of the complexity and diversity of the country , it may have a different affect in some provinces . 
i am focusing specifically on the ability of the provinces themselves to administer the act because we know there is a huge discrepancy in the country currently as to the financial ability of the provinces to provide services to their people . 
it only stands to reason that if we increase the provinces ' responsibility without increasing the proportionate resources then it will be exacerbated further . 
the differences that currently exist means that the have not provinces will be further burdened and will fall further behind . 
this is truly a very broad sweeping problem . 
the focus in the Chamber is most often between the province of Quebec and the provinces in English - speaking Canada . 
that is not the case . 
the transfer provisions that were touched on by many of the previous speakers are a bit of a ruse in a way . 
they give the impression that we are taking a young person into the adult court system . 
this may cause many people to shudder and think , " Oh , my goodness , we are bringing a 14 year old or 15 year old into an adult court where he or she will be treated in a much harsher way '' . 
that is to say that if young persons were sentenced to 18 months they would serve every day . 
they would remain in a young offender facility for that full period of incarceration . 
we know that is not the case in the adult system . 
this is not to say for a moment that incarceration is always the way . 
we know that the programming that is often available is not sufficient . 
we also know that simply removing a person from society will not fix them . 
it is often the last resort brought about to protect society when necessary from a person who has exhibited violent , anti - social behaviour . 
the concept of simply bringing a person into adult court and saying that it will fix the problem because he or she will be treated in a harsher fashion is not necessarily the truth of what has happened . 
i believe it is incumbent on the government to be very up front about what the system change will really amount to . 
the programming that is available in a youth facility is often the more appropriate one . 
often times bringing them into adult court exposes them to this atmosphere that has been discussed , which is that they will learn more sophisticated ways to commit crimes . 
they may be further victimized in an adult facility . 
there is an extremely dangerous element to this quick fix type solution that is being proposed . 
as has been stated many times , there are elements where this particular legislation has moved in the right direction . 
i , like all members of the justice committee and of the House , look forward to participating at the committee level and to the changes that may be brought about through that level of participation . 
i congratulate the participants who have taken part in the debate , as well as those who participated at the committee with their testimony . 
i look forward to further following the legislation as it moves through this place . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened very carefully to what the hon. member had to say and I note that he at least admits that we do things differently in Quebec and even that it is a model the government should follow , and that Quebec is a leader in this field . 
does the member know that no one in Quebec wants the amendments the minister is proposing ? 
does he know that the people in the Crown attorney ' s office , those who initiate proceedings under the law , do not want the minister ' s bill ? 
defence counsel in Quebec , those who defend young people , do not want it either . 
according to some retired judges , if the law passed by this parliament is applied , this law will be disastrous for the 16 year investment , in Quebec , in an approach , a very Quebec model . 
is the hon. member aware of that ? 
should the government not budge , not do anything , the Bloc Quebecois will try to introduce an amendment to have Quebec exempted from the application of Bill C - 3 so it may continue to apply the Young Offenders Act as it stands . 
can I count on the support of the Conservative Party , since it recognizes that we apply the law in Quebec and are leaders in the area ? 
can I count on the support of the Conservative Party in the ultimate attempt to exempt Quebec from this law , which will be devastating for all young offenders and society as a whole ? 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
madam Speaker , I thank my colleague who is also a member of the justice committee and a fine contributor to the same . 
i am very quick to recognize the fact that the province of Quebec has very much been a leader in the administration of justice and the administration of many of these innovative programs , restorative justice model programs that are most effective when dealing with youth . 
it is part of the great partnership that we enjoy . 
i would not in any way envision why the province of Quebec would want to opt out of this legislation . 
i do recognize that there are many elements of the justice system in Quebec . 
i was part of the committee which heard from many witnesses . 
i know there are groups within the system that do not want to see all of the changes that are encompassed by this bill . 
but there are very positive and practical elements that I think even the member would admit are necessary . 
Quebec is a very adaptable province . 
i am sure Quebec is going to see that there are positive elements that it can work with . 
i am sure all members of the House look forward to bringing some of those other changes forward that we would like to see happen at the committee . 
i have every confidence that my learned friend will do the same . 
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to thank the member for presenting his feelings and thoughts on the bill . 
however , this bill is couched almost entirely in terms of what the legislation will allow the courts to do . 
it does not grant authority to the courts to move 16 and 17 year olds who commit serious offences into adult court . 
it says that the trial will occur in juvenile court and then the crown prosecutor will have the opportunity to argue that an adult sentence should apply . 
the courts in this land are under the gun right now from certain circles , including members of the House , for being judicially active . 
even the business of releasing the names of those who have been convicted of violent offences is not something that is directed by the legislation or by the elected representatives of this country . 
it is going to be left in the hands of the courts to decide based upon the circumstances , regardless of what the people want , whether or not the names of those convicted of violent offences will be published . 
i wonder if the member , being a former crown prosecutor and I understand a good one , would be prepared to comment on this aspect of the bill . 
rather than the legislators telling the courts what we want done on behalf of Canadians , again we are going to leave it in the hands of the judges of this land . 
would my hon. friend be willing to comment on this aspect of the bill in light of the criticism some of the courts are receiving concerning judicial activism ? 
this is simply because legislation is being passed by the government , legislation that is so open ended that the judges can go in a number of different ways . 
in this case it is contrary to what we have heard Canadians say they want done about the Young Offenders Act . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
madam Speaker , I will try to address the points made by my colleague from Crowfoot who was a valued member of the justice committee . 
i know he has tremendous practical experience having worked as a police officer within the justice system for many years . 
i will not comment as to my own abilities as a crown prosecutor . 
i will try to address the issue with respect to transfers . 
i personally took part in a number of transfers from youth to adult court under the old system . 
at the end of the day , one was left to wonder whether one could even call upon the victims who were often forced to testify two , three and four times as a result of those old provisions . 
i welcome this change in terms of having one trial . 
however , I take issue , as the hon. member has pointed out , with the decision being made at the very end of the trial after it has taken place in youth court , which is often subject to different rules of admissibility , and with whether this is actually the proper focus . 
it is not something we can deal with very quickly in this context . 
i agree we have to empower judges , but with legislation such as this we sometimes have to put parameters in place . 
the way to do that in some instances is to have definitions of certain crimes that require mandatory minimum sentences . 
i do believe that for the most part judges themselves behave in a responsible way . 
unfortunately , there are some that do not . 
when that happens , perhaps we should look at methods of dealing with judges . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I am pleased to enter the debate on Bill C - 3 , the youth criminal justice act . 
at the very outset , I want to indicate that it is a very important piece of legislation . 
it underscores the commitment of the Government of Canada to deal with a very complex issue as it relates to youth justice . 
as the former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police , I sat on that board for 10 years . 
i can tell the House firsthand that the senior officer and rank and file levels , along with all members of the police service , worked diligently in this area to ensure that we had a justice system in place , especially as it related to our young people . 
with 700 police officers and civilians , we were cognizant of the fact that this was an important area and one that required the kind of attention the Government of Canada is now prepared to move on . 
from that sense I am very pleased to see this legislation proceed . 
subsequent to that , the youth criminal justice act was introduced . 
then the federal budget announced $ 206 million over three years to ensure that programs were put in place to help achieve the objectives of this legislation . 
the point in indicating that is to say that now is the time to move on with this , get it to committee and let Canadians have their say with respect to this area . 
i am pleased that we are moving in that direction and doing so expeditiously . 
the government ' s strategy for the renewal of youth justice recognized the foremost objective of public protection . 
it distinguishes legislation and programs appropriate for the small group of violent young offenders and those appropriate for the vast majority of non - violent youth offenders . 
it takes a much broader and more integrated approach that emphasizes prevention and rehabilitation . 
that is very key to this whole debate . 
the issue facing those of us who are interested in the youth justice system is not whether the system should be tough or lenient , but whether it should be made to deal with crime in a sensible way . 
for example , most of us believe that youths who commit minor thefts or have been in possession of stolen property should be held accountable for their actions and rightfully so . 
however , last year we sent 4,355 youths into custody when their most serious offence was one of the minor property offences . 
another 4,332 youths were put in custody for the offence of failure to comply with a disposition , typically violating a term of a probation order . 
these are both offences . 
those who are found to have committed these offences should be held accountable and we know that . 
these two groups of offences constituted over one - third of the custodial sentences handed down to youth last year . 
that quite frankly is unacceptable . 
no one is saying that these youth should not be held accountable for their actions . 
we need to ask ourselves whether it makes sense to spend $ 9,000 locking up a minor thief or someone who has violated a curfew . 
the choice is not one of doing nothing or putting a young person in prison . 
the youth criminal justice act recognizes that extrajudicial non - court measures are often the most effective way to deal with less serious youth crime . 
the act supports the use of such measures wherever and whenever possible that would be capable of holding the young person accountable . 
the act clearly provides that these measures should encourage the repair of harm caused to the victim and to the community . 
they should also promote the involvement of families , victims and the community in ensuring an appropriate , meaningful consequence for the young person . 
in order to encourage the use of creative and effective consequences for young people , the act supports the appropriate exercise of discretion by police officers and prosecutors . 
the act also recognizes that a range of approaches can provide meaningful consequences , including police warnings , formal police cautions , referrals to community programs , cautions by prosecutors and extra judicial sanctions , for example apologies to victims , restitution and community service . 
when the formal court process is required many sentences other than custody can provide meaningful consequences for youth crime . 
when these front end measures and non - custodial sentences are used effectively the provinces can reinvest the money saved into crime prevention strategies that will address the legitimate concerns of Canadians about crime . 
as part of its strategy for the renewal of youth justice the federal government has committed itself to a wide range of prevention programs . 
the other side of the coin is that by dealing sensibly with minor crime we can refocus the system on serious crime that Canadians have legitimate concerns about . 
the new act ' s sentencing principles make it very clear that youth sentences should reflect the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person . 
custody , then , will be targeted to youth that commit violent and serious repeat offences . 
in the new legislation judges will be required to impose a period of supervision in the community following custody that is equal to half the period of that custody . 
this will allow authorities to closely monitor and control the young person and to ensure that he or she receives the necessary treatment and programs to return successfully to the community . 
the period of supervision administered by the provinces will include stringent mandatory and optional conditions tailored to the individual . 
if a youth sentence , for example , would not be adequate to hold a young person accountable , the court may impose an adult sentence . 
the new legislation would make it easier to impose adult sentences for the most serious violent crimes . 
we are expanding both the list of offences and lowering the age at which youth can receive an adult sentence . 
when the legislation is passed , youth 14 years of age and older who are convicted of murder , attempted murder , manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault will receive an adult sentence unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise . 
we are also creating a fifth presumptive category for repeat of violent offences . 
this too underscores a commitment of the Government of Canada to move in this area and do it in an appropriate Canadian kind of way . 
the proposed legislation also provides for a new sentencing option for the most violent , high risk young offenders . 
the intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order provides greater control and guaranteed treatment to address the causes of the young person ' s violent behaviour . 
this is a kind of individualized treatment of intensive supervision which must be approved by the court and will assist us in curtailing youth crime in these areas . 
i want to conclude by saying that youth crime cannot be legislated away . 
i think we all know and understand that . 
we can , however , deal more appropriately with it than we do at the moment . 
we can set up an effective set of programs outside the youth justice system and custodial and non - custodial rehabilitation programs within it which would reduce crime and hopefully will . 
it is a complex issue and I think we are doing it in a very effective way . 
let me simply conclude by saying that certainly the residents in my area of Waterloo - Wellington , and I believe those across Canada , support our balanced approach to this very complex issue . 
now is the time to act . 
let us move the bill on to committee . 
let us have Canadians have their say with respect to this area . 
let us do so expeditiously . 
with great foresight we have brought forward legislation in the best interest of all Canadians . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I congratulate the hon. member for Waterloo - Wellington on his remarks and his contribution to the debate . 
as a former police officer he speaks from a very practical viewpoint , which is extremely important when dealing with matters of criminal justice . 
he also brings a very non - partisan tone to the debate , which I applaud . 
it is something that we need more of on matters of criminal justice . 
my question for him is with respect to the elements of the bill that would put greater power into the hands of the police to exercise discretion in the field , that is for them to make judgment calls on whether this is a matter which should proceed through the criminal justice system . 
the police are put in the often unenviable position of making that first call , making the decision on whether it is something for which they lay a criminal charge , lay an information , or perhaps proceed to a crown prosecutor for greater advice . 
does the hon. member agree that increased discretion also carries with it obvious increased time , increased resources and increased necessity of the police to spend time doing something that perhaps they traditionally have not been entrusted with ? 
does he believe therefore that the requests of the Canadian Police Association , many of the stakeholders and many of the provinces in calling for greater resources to be attached to the bill are on the right track and that his government will have to respond by laying down more dollars ? 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member opposite for the very good question . 
those of us who are working with community based policing know full well the importance of getting out into the community , especially with respect to young people , to ensure that we deal with them in an effective and meaningful way . 
we have done it in the past and we continue to do so . 
it underscores the commitment of not only the police but also the wider community to do the right thing when it comes to young people wherever they live in Canada . 
with respect to resources and the kind of commitment that are necessary to deal with young people , the hon. member makes a very good point in terms of the local police agencies having the kind of resources necessary to do the job effectively and well . 
when we give the kind of discretion that is being proposed it requires additional work , but I have to tell the hon. member that the policing profession is very professional . 
it carries out its duties with a great sense of loyalty and dedication , knowing that it must do the right thing , especially for young people . 
the kinds of training programs that are put in place underscore that kind of commitment to professionalism and dedication . 
i am convinced that with the proper and necessary resources the police will act in the appropriate way . 
they really are unsung heroes . 
they put their lives on the line daily for all of us . 
we need to congratulate them repeatedly for the kind of work that they do , especially in the all important youth area . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened to the government member ' s speech and we agree on one thing : when it comes to the Young Offenders Act , Liberal , Conservative and Reform members all see problems where there are none . 
all the hon. member said in support of the bill , with his quotes and statistics , is that Ontario taxpayers were in favour of reinvesting , of the rehabilitation and reintegration of young offender . 
but this can already be done through the Young Offenders Act , and I am wondering if he is aware of it . 
all the examples he gave in support of Bill C - 3 are things that can already be done through the YOA . 
this is why , in Quebec , there is a unanimous consensus against the justice minister ' s bill . 
the problem with the YOA is not its wording , but its enforcement . 
in Ontario as in the western provinces , it is not being enforced . 
however , when it is , the re - offending rate for serious crimes such as murder and armed robbery is less than 5 % - I believe it is 2 % , but I do not want to mislead the House . 
these are the statistics you get when you enforce the Young Offenders Act properly . 
what purpose would that serve ? 
it would only brand them for the rest of their lives . 
one day , the 14 year old who was sent to prison or went through the highly repressive system we want to set up , will get out . 
and he will be what , 24 or 25 years old ? 
but once he is out , what will he be able do after having been branded a criminal for the rest of his life ? 
this will not in any way help the society whom we claim to be fighting for , whom we are trying to better protect by improving the legislation . 
the existing legislation does . 
did the hon. member take the time to read the current Young Offenders Act and did he notice the so - called major changes the minister wants to make ? 
also , does the hon. member realize that the only province where everyone agrees the legislation is enforced properly , and I am talking of course about the province of Quebec , has a very high success rate ? 
why change the law , when it is in the western part of the country that things should be changing . 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member opposite for the question . 
i have read the existing legislation and I am also very cognizant of the new proposed legislation . 
when the government launched the strategy to look into the whole youth justice initiative and the renewal we are now presenting we certainly looked at the Quebec model as a model that had a lot to offer in terms of what it represented for Canada and Canadians , wherever they are . 
so it is that we incorporated those kinds of facets into the new legislation , recognizing that we have a lot to share and a lot to offer . 
we did so in a spirit of co - operation , knowing that for young people across Canada we could bring the best from all areas including Quebec and do so in a very positive way . 
that is exactly what we have done . 
we have done the kinds of things that are necessary for our young people to put systems in place that benefit them and society as a whole . 
the Speaker : 
however I would like to go to Statements by Members now as it is almost 2 o ' clock . 
statements BY MEMBERS 
united NATIONS DAY 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 23 , the eve of United Nations Day , citizens around the world are organizing a vigil . 
their goal is to put pressure on their respective governments to provide adequate funding for the United Nations . 
many national governments do not pay their dues to the United Nations , which seriously weakens many organizations in that body . 
for example , the United States alone owes more than $ 1 billion in dues . 
canada is in the minority , having no debt toward the United Nations . 
this vigil has been organized for the past three years . 
in 1998 it was hosted in 42 cities around the world . 
this year the event is called the millennium mobilization , to recognize the entry of the United Nations into the 21 st century . 
it is an organization which has done much to help our intergovernmental relations , to help rehabilitate war torn countries , and to fight poverty and starvation . 
the United Nations needs not only moral support from its members but also financial support to continue its projects and programs . 
therefore I urge all members of the world body to contribute accordingly .

food 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to give the Liberal government a lesson on the value of work . 
it is said that we can live a minute without air , a day or two without water , and a week or two without food . 
some of us might last a little longer . 
food is a basic essential for life . 
we can do without a doctor for years if we do not get sick . 
we might get by without a lawyer for years . 
we might get by without politicians for a century or maybe a millennium , but we cannot live without farmers . 
the farmer ' s work has huge value because without the farmer , we starve . 
where is the equal pay for work of greater value here ? 
why is the government ignoring the plight of farmers on whom we depend for our very lives ? 
history shows clearly that a nation can lose its sovereignty if it loses its independent secure food supply . 
it is pay for work of immense value . 
it is time we recognized farmers for what they are worth .

science AND TECHNOLOGY 
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada is celebrating National Science and Technology Week from October 15 to 24 . 
canada has made a commitment to become the world ' s smartest natural resources steward , developer , user and exporter , the most high tech , the most environmentally friendly , the most socially responsible , the most competitive and productive . 
during National Science and Technology Week , Natural Resources Canada opens its doors to the community to communicate the importance of the sustainable development of our energy , forest and mineral resources .

CANADIAN ECONOMY 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi - Baie - James - Nunavik , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , Statistics Canada reported that Canada ' s balance of trade is continuing its momentum . 
in January , it was at the $ 22.1 billion level , and had already exceeded the total for 1998 , which was $ 18.9 billion for the same month . 
a performance like this shows that our government ' s economic choices are good ones . 
they show that the climate is encouraging the economic agents in key sectors of activity to invest in this country . 
news like this is certainly not pleasing to the opposition parties , but they will have to accept it . 
the economic decision makers feel that the conditions are right to ensure sustained and sustainable economic growth for Canada .

LUPUS AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to bring to the attention of the House and of all Canadians that the month of October is Lupus Awareness Month . 
Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease which affects approximately 50,000 Canadians . 
Lupus is characterized by a malfunction of the immmune system , which attacks different parts of the body itself , causing inflammation in those tissues . 
the mission of Lupus Canada is to help the Lupus community , their families and caregivers by providing them with the latest information , support and education , regardless of income , culture or religion . 
i invite all hon. members to congratulate Lupus Canada and to wish it every success with its awareness campaign .

foreign AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the foreign affairs minister has no business calling for Pakistan to be expelled from the Commonwealth following the military takeover . 
last year the sanctions were counterproductive . 
the people of Pakistan knew the government was corrupt . 
no one supports military coups . 
however , since the military took over , there has been calm and peace in the country . 
the military has promised to return the country to democratic civilian rule as soon as possible . 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs does not practise what he preaches . 
he does not clean up corruption in his own department , embassies and passport offices . 
he bent over backward to support Suharto . 
he continued foreign aid to Algeria after the military interfered with the democratic election process . 
he condemned the U.S.A. for isolating Cuba . 
his policies are inconsistent and hypocritical . 
he talks soft power but applies hard power .

COPERNICUS LODGE 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , located in the heart of the Polish community in my riding , on March 14 , 1979 Copernicus Lodge opened its doors as a retirement home with 100 self - care apartments . 
on Sunday , October 24 the residents , their families , the staff , volunteers and the board of directors of the Copernicus Lodge will celebrate 20 years of caring and serving our community .

SEMAINE DES BIBLIOTH È QUES PUBLIQUES DU QU É BEC 
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Semaine des biblioth è ques publiques du Qu é bec , which is taking place this week , seeks to make Quebecers aware of the multiple resources provided by libraries . 
public libraries are no longer the austere and cold places that some of us may remember . 
Quebec ' s 974 libraries offer such resources as books , records , videos , CD - ROMs and the Internet . 
also , as pointed out in a Statistic Canada study , there is a connection between reading to young children and school success . 
in Laval , for example , libraries organized L ' Heure du conte pour les bambins , public dictations , including the famous Dict é e du Nord , and readings by well - known authors . 
i am taking this opportunity to thank all those people in Quebec who help make public libraries lively and thriving places to learn , discover and dream .

co - OPERATIVES 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
the theme for this week is " Co - operation - Shaping our Future '' , emphasizing that the co - operative model is a potent economic force in the Canadian economy and a leading source of jobs , incomes and community stability in many regions of the country . 
for this reason I would ask members to join with me in recognizing and congratulating the co - operative sector which has and continues to make such a large contribution to our country . 
currently co - operatives , including caisses populaires and credit unions , have a membership of 15 million Canadians and have combined assets of over $ 167 billion . 
co - operatives employ over 150,000 Canadians and over 70,000 volunteers offer their time . 
for co - operatives , serving the needs of members always takes precedence over the bottom line . 
it is for that reason co - operatives have grown .

agriculture 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today ' s issue of the Western Producer reported the statistics on AIDA payouts to date . 
in Alberta 88 % of payouts were made . 
events have shown that western interests are of no interest at all to this government . 
the agriculture minister promised money to get the crop in . 
now it is off and 57 % of Saskatchewan farmers still have not seen any money . 
Saskatchewan voters will deliver an indictment on this smug Liberal government through the Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar byelection . 
we cannot wait . 
* * * 
corporate MANSLAUGHTER 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the leader of the New Democratic Party tabled a private member ' s bill to make corporate manslaughter a crime . 
i am proud to be a seconder of this bill . 
each year hundreds of Canadians are killed on the job and over one million are injured . 
on average , two Canadians are killed on the job every day . 
that is two families every day where a mother , father , spouse or a child does not come home . 
many of these deaths and injuries could and should be prevented but are not because of negligence by company managers who care more about profits than lives . 
company managers who knowingly or negligently allow workers into unsafe conditions are criminals and should go to jail . 
the New Democratic Party bill will make sure that they can be charged . 
the Liberal government still has not learned from the Westray disaster . 
negligence by company managers caused the deaths of 26 miners in Westray but no charges were laid . 
safety , not profit , must come first in the workplace . 
the real possibility of criminal charges will finally force company officials to make safety the top priority . 
i urge the Liberal government and all its members of the House to make the safety of Canadian workers their top priority . 
* * * 
GAIRDNER FOUNDATION 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to ask the House to join me in congratulating the Gairdner Foundation of Toronto as it celebrates an important anniversary . 
for 40 years , the foundation has been recognizing and rewarding those in the medical world who , through unselfish devotion of their time and efforts , have been successful in making major contributions to research for the conquest of disease and the relief of human suffering . 
over time , international Gairdner awards have been presented to 249 recipients , including 51 who have gone on to win the Nobel prize . 
on behalf of the House I congratulate the founders and trustees of the Gairdner Foundation on this distinguished record of achievement . 
the more than 50 Gairdner winners gathering in Toronto and 13 other centres across Canada this week for the Minds That Matter symposium to mark this occasion provide an eloquent testimony to the success of this important institution . 
we salute their past and wish them a great future .

Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today , Quebec sprinter Bruny Surin will receive the Maurice Richard award . 
this award for excellence was created in 1979 by Montreal ' s Soci é t é Saint - Jean - Baptiste and is given to an athlete who is an honour both to his or her sport and to Quebec . 
recognized for his integrity , determination , courage and perseverance , Bruny Surin is one of Quebec ' s great sports figures . 
he has run the second fastest 100 metre dash in history , and he is a true inspiration and model for all young people . 
the Bloc Quebecois congratulates this great athlete , not only for his outstanding performances , but also for persevering in a sport he loves , sometimes against all odds , through the good years as well as the more difficult ones . 
Bruny , our hearts will be beating for you when we watch you race in the Sydney Olympic Games . 
congratulations and good luck in the pursuit of your brilliant career .

JULIUS K . NYERERE MEMORIAL PROJECT 
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the world will mourn Julius Nyerere , the former president of Tanzania , who passed away last week . 
Mr. Nyerere was the president of Tanzania for 24 years . 
he was highly respected for his honesty and dedication to development at the grassroots level and for his role as a leading African statesman . 
throughout his country he was known simply and affectionately as Mwalimu , which means teacher . 
today the Minister of International Co - operation is representing Canada in Tanzania at his funeral . 
Canadians should know that CIDA will honour Mr. Nyerere ' s memory and legacy by naming one important community project every year in Tanzania the Julius K . Nyerere Memorial Project .

pay EQUITY 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , while the President of the Treasury Board is studying the federal court decision on pay equity , I am going to give her additional material she should take into consideration in this regard during her deliberation process . 
first , this is the fourth decision in favour of 200,000 employees from the federal public sector , mainly women . 
second , taxpayers are paying millions of dollars per week in interest because of the government ' s refusal to respect the court decision . 
third , it is time for her government to provide equality to all Canadians as we approach the new millennium . 
fourth , the President of the Treasury Board has an obligation to the millions of women of this country who are anxiously awaiting her decision . 
women in the minister ' s own caucus have publicly stated that it is time to finally respect and recognize the court decision and pay up . 
as the court ruling states , let us not forget that justice delayed is justice denied .

royal 22 ND REGIMENT 
Mr. Ren é Laurin ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , October 21 marks the founding of the Royal 22 nd Regiment . 
this military unit comprising primarily Quebecers has existed and brought us honour for 85 years , as of today . 
this regiment was awarded over 550 decorations and insignia for its bravery and heroism in the two world wars and the Korean war . 
in addition , a number of the members of the Royal 22 nd joined UN peacekeeping forces and were awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1988 . 
their loyalty has never been questioned either . 
as proof , 250 soldiers from the Royal 22 nd left Quebec City Friday to join the international mission sent to East Timor , thus reaffirming their tradition of commitment . 
on behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois , I would like to pay tribute to the Royal 22 nd regiment , to the men and women there in the service of peace and to those like them .

JEUX DE LA FRANCOPHONIE CANADIENNE 
Mr. Rick Limoges ( Windsor - St. 
Mr. Speaker , the first Jeux de la Francophonie canadienne were held in Memramcook , New Brunswick , between August 19 and 22 . 
thirteen delegations of young francophones and francophiles aged between 15 and 18 came to celebrate their association with the French Canadian culture . 
they numbered nearly 1,000 young people and they came from all the provinces and territories . 
in this Ann é e de la Francophonie canadienne , the games afforded a fine opportunity to show off the vitality of our young francophones and to help instill the French language and culture in their hearts . 
the Government of Canada and , more specifically , the Minister of Canadian Heritage is proud to have supported the first edition of the Jeux de la Francophonie canadienne and congratulates the F é d é ration de la jeunesse canadienne - fran ç aise , which was the force behind this grand celebration that brought together young francophones - 
the Speaker : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but we must now proceed to Oral Question Period . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today is a sad day for the individual rights of aboriginal people in Canada . 
the Nisga ' a agreement fails to provide Nisga ' a people with private property rights , fails to provide Nisga ' a women with the same rights and protections enjoyed by all other Canadian women and puts in peril the charter rights of each and every Nisga ' a individual . 
how can the government and the minister ignore the fundamental rights of aboriginal Canadians ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is wrong . 
we are respecting the rights of aboriginal Canadians and all Canadians to live together in peace and harmony in British Columbia and all over our country . 
it is the Reform Party that is disturbing the tranquillity of Canadians with its approach to this fundamental matter . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , members of the Reform Party have a fundamentally different position than the government . 
we have a positive vision for aboriginal people . 
we want a new start for aboriginal Canadians in this country . 
we want aboriginal women to be full and equal partners , both on reserve and off reserve . 
we want aboriginal people to have the same rights and protections which all other Canadians enjoy . 
how can the government continue to ignore these fundamental rights that aboriginal people are crying out for in this country ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to indicate to the member across the way that the first thing he should do is read the agreement . 
we purposely sent the agreement over to the member a number of months ago in order for him to have a chance to read it . 
in the agreement it states specifically that it is under the constitution , the people are under the charter , the Nass Valley and the Nisga ' a people themselves . 
also the member will notice in the agreement that aboriginal women are under provincial law and they will continue to be under provincial law . 
i want to make one more point . 
this member said in the press not too long ago - 
the Speaker : 
the hon. member for Skeena . 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister knows that no private property rights are created under this agreement . 
he knows that without private property rights aboriginal women cannot possibly hope to enjoy the same rights and protections as all other Canadian women in the event of a marriage breakup . 
why did the minister agree to sign on to this treaty when there is no provision for private property rights for Nisga ' a people ? 
why did he do that ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , before I state why there are property rights , let me read what the member said not too long ago . 
on Saturday , September 11 , Mr. Scott said that the successful negotiations of recent treaties in British Columbia are a good indication the system is working . 
in fact it is not communal . 
the member should read the agreement . 
the Speaker : 
i would remind hon. members not to use each other ' s names in the course of either questions or answers . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Nisga ' a treaty assigns 25 % of the salmon in the Nass River to the Nisga ' a . 
given that there are four other bands that have claims to that fishery , virtually all Nass River salmon will be transferred to aboriginals under treaty . 
if this government , the NDP and the Conservatives are willing to assign virtually 100 % of Nass River fish to natives , why should non - native east coast lobster fishermen trust the government to keep a place for them in the fishery ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Canadians know exactly what Reform stands for . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is small comfort to the Nova Scotia lobster fishermen . 
uncertainty directly related to the Nisga ' a treaty is hurting the economy of northwestern British Columbia . 
concerns from loggers and fishermen were ignored . 
we now see the same lack of investor confidence resulting from the handling of treaty issues on the east coast , where a large Yarmouth based lobster buyer cannot obtain operating funds for this year because of uncertainty over the Marshall decision . 
why is the government proceeding with a policy that is destroying investor confidence and killing jobs in the fisheries on both coasts ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we have a federal representative who is trying to create certainty . 
if the hon. member clearly wants certainty , then he should be voting for the Nisga ' a agreement because that is what will create certainty . 
everybody will know what the rules are .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Tuesday , the Minister of Canadian Heritage advised the House that there would be a meeting today between members of the MUC police , officials from the departments of National Revenue and Canadian Heritage , and representatives of the RCMP . 
if she has asked the RCMP to conduct another investigation , are we to understand that she has decided that it should be Canada - wide ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there was an investigation done between 1995 and 1997 . 
there was also one done by the MUC police . 
i wonder whether she should not , in fact , have consulted and studied this investigation between 1995 and 1997 , and had the courage to take action so that such practices did not recur . 
she did nothing . 
can she explain why she did nothing following the serious allegations in the 1995 to 1997 investigation , and why she is now requesting that the same work be done again , even though it has already been done by the MUC ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , Monday and last week , the Bloc Quebecois made serious allegations . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the beginning of this case , the Minister of Canadian Heritage has been accusing us of inventing problems and starting rumors , as did Mr. Macerola from Telefilm Canada , who said , somewhat prematurely , that the whole issue was an urban legend . 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage . 
will the minister admit that since Friday , when she claimed not to know anything about this issue , she has learned , thanks to the Bloc Quebecois , that there are at least four cases of people whose names were used , that other producers might be implicated , and that , for the time being , this whole thing only involves Telefilm ' s Montreal component ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member made allegations on Friday . 
today , he is making more allegations . 
again , I would ask him to contact the RCMP to inform them of his allegations . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res - Les - Patriotes , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , how could the minister tell us that she found out about the whole issue of Friday , considering that an investigation took place in 1997 , that shocking statements were made early in the fall by some prominent figures from that sector , that the Quebec Minister of Culture decided to order an investigation through SODEC to shed light on this issue , and that her deputy minister had been aware of the issue for two or three days ? 
is the minister being kept in the dark by her officials , or is she simply refusing to assume her responsibilities ? 
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is the one who is making allegations . 
he did so on Friday , then on Monday , and again on Tuesday . 
if he has allegations to make , then he should go directly to the RCMP , which is there to investigate . 
* * * 
CANADIAN FARMERS 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food . 
everybody is holding their breath waiting for the minister to respond . 
when will the minister stop stalling ? 
when will this minister end the anguish and introduce a decent farm aid package ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this government started to act nearly a year ago when we contributed $ 900 million before the budget was introduced last year . 
that is being used by producers . 
it will all be used . 
it will also be added to by $ 600 million from the provinces . 
we made changes to the net income stabilization account which made another $ 121 million available across Canada . 
there is still more money in the net income stabilization account that has been triggered by farmers as well . 
i am encouraged by the fact that they are now using that account . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
no one believes that this government has responded adequately to this crisis . 
how many farms will go under ? 
how many small businesses will fail ? 
how many families will be driven off their farms before this government puts aside its arrogance and puts forward the kind of farm aid that will save our family farms ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , over $ 1.5 billion is certainly a significant amount of money . 
unfortunately , there are always limits to resources . 
we are trying to find every way , shape and form that we can to help . 
we have made changes to the AIDA program . 
we have made additions to the AIDA program . 
we continue to do all we possibly can within the limit of the resources that are available . 
* * * 
airline INDUSTRY 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
obviously there is now a power struggle between the Minister of Industry and the Minister of Transport . 
the Minister of Transport is proposing legislation to let him have a final say in all Competition Bureau tribunal reports . 
i want the Minister of Industry , on behalf of consumers , to assure the House that no power will be transferred to the Minister of Transport on airline merger issues . 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member should read the Canada Transportation Act because he will see that the use of section 47 is done so only with the authority of not only the Minister of Transport , but the Minister of Industry . 
my colleague , the Minister of Industry , and I have worked on this file in concert from the beginning . 
we continue to do so . 
the section 47 process that we brought forward on August 13 is working because we now have private sector proposals that allow the restructuring of the airline industry . 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister has only one answer for every question and it is the wrong one . 
i want to read to the House a tribunal report dated 1993 . If the minister has the final say in future reports , we will never hear words like these . 
the tribunal report states that if Canadian Airlines is forced to merge with Air Canada , the tribunal finds that competition in domestic airline markets will likely be substantially lessened . 
it goes on to say that charter carriers cannot compensate for Canadian ' s removal . 
it is absolutely unacceptable for the Minister of Transport to now be able to doctor up Competition Bureau reports . 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
however , the bureau is now working on a new report , which will be made available to me very shortly and will be made public . 
it will help us in the restructuring process . 
these are the guidelines being issued by the bureau under the auspices of section 47 of the Canada Transport Act .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , non - Nisga ' a residents who live on Nisga ' a land will have no right to vote for the government but they will be subject to Nisga ' a laws and taxation . 
why is the Liberal government endorsing taxation without representation ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
one of the most important aspects of the treaty is that all non - Nisga ' a will still be Canadian citizens and will still be able to vote for their MLA and their member of parliament . 
they will be able to participate on all the boards , including the education board and the health council of the Nisga ' a people . 
they will have better representation than they are getting from the Reform Party . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , non - Nisga ' a will soon have to send their tax dollars to their local government for which they have no right to vote . 
i know the government does not care about taxpayers but I never thought that it would go as far as denying taxpayers the right to vote . 
why is the government denying non - Nisga ' a residents the right to vote for the government that levies their taxes ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to encourage Reform Party members . 
as we get into the debate , it will be very important for them to read the treaty . 
they should also ask us for a briefing , which will be very helpful . 
as we talk about representation , I will give the Reform Party members an example of what representation means to the Nisga ' a people . 
the member representing the Nisga ' a and the people of the Nass Valley has 25 first nations . 
out of those 25 first nations , 17 have not seen their member of parliament in six years .

air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as the future of air travel in Canada goes , there are two offers on the table : one a legal one from Air Canada , and the other an illegal one from Onex , which would require the law to be changed before it could be entertained . 
my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
are we to understand from the statement made by the Prime Minister on Monday that it is up to Air Canada ' s shareholders to decide , and that his government is prepared to change the law if Air Canada ' s shareholders chose to accept the Onex offer ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously we have two offers . 
it is up to the Air Canada shareholders to decide which is best for them . 
after , when the government has received a conditional agreement , we shall see whether the offer is in keeping with the government ' s principles . 
in our opinion , the process is working , and working fine . 
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on the one hand the Minister of Transport says he wants to introduce a bill to change the legislative framework , while on the other the Prime Minister is saying that there must not be any change because this is solely up to the shareholders of Air Canada . 
is there not a contradiction here ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this has to be done in stages . 
there is a process involving the shareholders of Air Canada , then one involving the government and the members of this House . 
obviously , the Prime Minister and I agree completely with this process . 
as I said , the process is good for the Canadian public , because it will bring about the restructuring of this industry .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Government of British Columbia cut off debate on the Nisga ' a treaty before many of the provisions were even debated . 
today the federal minister stated that he too plans to cut off debate if he does not feel that he likes the tone . 
there is democracy is action . 
will the Government of Canada commit to a more democratic process and assure the House and concerned British Columbians that full debate will be allowed and that time allocation and closure will not cut off debate on this critical subject ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the bill will soon be called for second reading debate . 
it will be followed by committee stage consideration . 
there will be report stage and third reading . 
the debate will continue according to the rules . 
obviously the rules include a means of coming to an end at one stage of debate and moving to the next . 
together , we in the House will decide if those stages are required . 
a lot depends on how the debate goes . 
let us all take part in the debate in a meaningful way and hopefully we will reach prompt decisions that will be in the interests of the Nisga ' a people , the people of British Columbia and all of Canada . 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in other words , the government intends to cut off fair debate and deny the public the right to hear what is going on in the treaty . 
the Liberals spent a fortune of taxpayers ' money on polling and then ignored the results . 
extensive polling in British Columbia indicated widespread concern over the Nisga ' a treaty as it is written . 
will the government commit to holding hearings in British Columbia , as part of this so - called democratic process , to enable all British Columbians to voice their concern , a right that was requested by the B.C. Liberal Party and denied by the NDP government ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
if there are decisions on time allocation , the decisions will come into place because there will be a majority vote for them by the House according to our rules .

employment INSURANCE 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the reform of EI with respect to parental leave announced in the throne speech will not benefit all parents , far from it . 
women have great difficulty qualifying because of the number of hours of work required . 
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
will the minister admit that the problem of qualifying must be addressed first , so as to give parents access to benefits and , to that end , will she agree to lower the number of hours required to qualify for parental leave from 700 to 300 ? 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Quebecers are very happy with the announcement we made last week . 
the president of the F é d é ration des femmes du Qu é bec told us that , when she heard the announcement , she told herself that it was certainly a step in the right direction . 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu é bec , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is a step in the right direction , but one that will miss its target . 
will the minister finally admit that there are several problems with her parental leave proposal that must be sorted out , including the number of hours needed by women to qualify , which must be lowered to 300 from 700 ; and the level of benefits which , at 55 % of income , is not enough to meet the needs of families . 
i ask her in all sincerity whether she is going to solve these two problems . 
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , without question , the undertaking of the government is extremely significant . 
in our view , it will change the whole context of Canadian society . 
the government is committed to families and we are proving it .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Indian affairs minister has publicly stated that accountability is the top priority for his portfolio . 
i have been to hundreds of reserves across the country . 
i know how grassroots natives define accountability . 
how does the minister define accountability ? 
you guys don ' t even know the meaning of it . 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , accountability is a duly elected chief and council on reserve who are elected by their constituents . 
an hon. member : 
how many reserves have you been to , Bob ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault : 
Mr. Speaker , I have 51 first nations and I know I have been to all of them , contrary to some of these guys . 
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it certainly does not tell the grassroots people much with an answer like that . 
one thing is for certain , I am sure we could count on one hand , if at all , the number of times the word " accountability " is mentioned in the Nisga ' a agreement . 
could the minister please explain how placing this land and money in the hands of a few will benefit the greater population ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that is why the members un - united alternative across the way is just not getting it . 
let me answer the question for them . 
the fact remains that the assumption - 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
we have heard the question and now I would like to hear the answer . 
the hon. minister of Indian affairs . 
hon. Robert D . Nault : 
Mr. Speaker , it is below this place to try to answer a question that suggests that aboriginal people somehow are not accountable when they are elected by their own peers . 
that is the most disgusting comment I have heard from that member for almost a week . 
* * * 
pay EQUITY 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , since the federal court ' s pay equity ruling was announced , there has been a general call for the government to implement it without delay . 
even members of the Liberal caucus are beginning to feel ashamed of the minister ' s attitude in this affair . 
the message seems clear to me . 
when does the minister intend to take action ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
in a few days , Mr. Speaker . 
* * * 
foreign AFFAIRS 
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
since the conclusion of the conflict in Serbia , we have witnessed attempts by many Serbs to build a democratic society . 
we have witnessed a pro - democracy rally , a budding opposition movement and many attempts to establish a free press . 
what is Canada doing to encourage democratic development in Serbia ? 
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , just this week we announced that we will reopen the embassy in Belgrade at the level of charg é d ' affaires , along with the resources of the Canada fund , specifically to promote democracy and reform and to establish links with the pro - democratic movement in Serbia . 
it will also give us an opportunity to maintain effective links with the Canadian presence in Kosovo that is working on peacekeeping and humanitarian matters . 
this is one clear indication of our commitment to try to promote democratic reform in that country . 
* * * 
aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
it is mind - boggling that there are 50 sidebar agreements yet to be negotiated . 
it is shameful that there are overlapping land claims on this same area . 
it is pitiful that British Columbians have never been allowed to affirm this agreement in a referendum . 
it is incomprehensible that the minister would stand at a press conference and say that he looks forward to limiting the debate here in the House . 
why has the government decided that democracy also has to be a victim of the Nisga ' a agreement ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , democracy will be reflected by what goes on in the House because we will debate the bill on second reading . 
this is democracy in action . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there will also be closure and time allocation , I am sure . 
after two weeks of work , the minister has quite a track record . 
he decrees that parliament will not be allowed to fully debate the Nisga ' a agreement . 
he accuses British Columbians of being unable to understand this agreement . 
he refuses to allow amendments that will protect aboriginal women . 
he forces one group of Canadians against another . 
what does he hope to accomplish in his second and third weeks in office ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to accomplish keeping the Reform alive but it is not doing a very good job of helping me . 
let me make one point that the hon. member is again suggesting . 
we have now gone as far as to brief all major media , so they will not get away with this in the House any more . 
the fact remains that aboriginal women are represented in the legislation through provincial legislation and will have their rights protected . 
now the hon. member should stand in his place to apologize for making statements that are not factually correct . 
* * * 
the ENVIRONMENT 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is a factually correct statement . 
residents and local governments across Ontario , including Thunder Bay , Sault Ste. Marie and Nepean , have all understandably voiced objections to the federal government ' s plan to ship MOx fuel containing weapons grade plutonium through their communities . 
it is unacceptable that such a potentially hazardous scheme is being undertaken without the support of the public or indeed parliament . 
why will the government not address the legitimate safety and environmental concerns of Canadians and put an end to the project ? 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we both have and are addressing those concerns . 
we have held public consultations with all the local officials . 
we have held public open houses to provide complete information . 
we have provided a public comment period to the Department of Transport , which ended a week or so ago . 
now the Department of Transport will take all that information into account before it makes a final decision on whether all the laws are being properly respected to ensure that the public interest is fully protected . 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister may want to have a public discussion with Ontario Power because it appears today that Ontario Power and the province of Ontario oppose the federal government ' s plan to burn MOx in Ontario nuclear reactors . 
Ontario Power is not even studying the option . 
given that the main purpose and rationale for the federal government ' s plan was to import it for use in Ontario , something Ontario does not even want , why is the government still considering this action ? 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , again the hon. member forgets that this is very much a foreign policy initiative in the interest of promoting world peace and reducing the threat of nuclear weapons . 
we have said we are prepared to consider the principle and to conduct the tests . 
we are not committed to anything beyond the testing . 
the testing is covered under existing regulatory authority . 
if there is ever to be any further commercial activity , it would be subject to a full environmental health and safety review . 
* * * 
air TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in the air transportation issue , is it true that the Minister of Transport wants to appropriate more power , at the expense of the Competition Bureau , to ensure that he is the one and the only one to decide whether to accept or reject any proposal ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I repeat that we have section 47 of the Canadian Transportation Act in place . 
it provides for a certain process that allows the Competition Bureau to give its advice . 
that advice will be tabled very shortly and will help us in the restructuring of the airline industry . 
Mr. Andr é Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister will probably wait until next Tuesday before announcing , probably with great fanfare , something extraordinary . 
however , in the meantime , and out of respect for parliament , can the minister assure all parliamentarians that his department and his government will not go against any ruling made by the Canadian Competition Bureau in the air transportation issue , yes or no ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said before , the bureau ' s advice will be very helpful in dealing with this very difficult file . 
as for disrespecting parliament , what more respect can one have than to go to committee where there can be hours of questioning and debate and looking into all the details rather than deal with things in a cursory way in the House of Commons ? 
* * * 
grain 
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood St. James - Assiniboia , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the wheat board . 
well over 70 % of the grain produced in western Canada is exported out of the country . 
therefore the next round of WTO negotiations beginning in Seattle next month raises several critical issues ranging from those damaging export subsidies to support for the Canadian Wheat Board . 
what is the minister doing to ensure that farmers will gain maximum benefits from the international marketplace ? 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Canada - U.S. grain trade is bedevilled by far too many myths and sterile debates about marketing ideologies . 
i have met with the U.S. wheat associates organization and with the representatives of 13 American wheat producing states . 
this weekend I will be meeting with most of the major U.S. grain milling companies . 
the message is always consistent . 
we are each other ' s best customers . 
we have a huge amount in common . 
let us not batter away at each other . 
instead , let us make common cause against the subsidies , the distortions and the unfair market access rules of the European Union which are the most pernicious source of damage to both Canadian and American farmers and the world ' s grain trade . 
* * * 
merchant NAVY VETERANS 
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , after 54 years of denial of equality of opportunity for our merchant navy veterans , a Liberal committee offers an empty handshake and a promise that the veterans will be studied by college kids . 
who would seriously believe that this would be fair ? 
the minister must do more to resolve the issue . 
we simply cannot have this bitterness taken to the graves of our veterans . 
will the minister confirm that he will provide these veterans with a more respectful and just settlement ? 
hon. George S . Baker ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have met with four organizations concerning the question of the merchant navy . 
i consulted four groups on this issue , and they all support the Liberal government ' s actions . 
* * * 
bill C - 6 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterdaty two Quebec ministers wrote the Minister of Industry to ask for a meeting on the legislative duplication the minister is preparing to create with passage of his Bill C - 6 on the protection of personal information . 
does the minister intend to agree to meet with the Quebec ministers , and consequently to suspend consideration of the bill in this House until such time as that meeting has taken place ? 
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Minister of National Revenue and Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think that the bill introduced by my colleague the Minister of Industry is necessary in this age of e - commerce and the Internet . 
i would like to point out that my colleague has already responded to numerous requests from the Government of Quebec precisely in order to avoid any form of duplication and to ensure that , when the legislation is passed , it will respect the Government of Quebec ' s legislation . 
i believe that the two governments can work together in order to serve the interests of the entire population well , and to protect their privacy . 
* * * 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government may be party to a conspiracy to cover up use of toxic and lethal depleted uranium in Kosovo . 
the chair of the UN - Balkans environmental task force says NATO is refusing to co - operate with its investigation into DU use which has been linked to stillbirths , children born with defects , childhood leukaemia and other cancers , and the gulf war syndrome . 
is the minister aware of this NATO coverup and will he commit to Canadians that he will do everything in his power to ensure NATO fully complies with the investigation into depleted uranium use in Kosovo ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians have not used depleted uranium . 
our CF - 18 s did not use depleted uranium when they were involved in Kosovo . 
we have taken steps to ensure the safety of our troops in that area . 
they are given personal radioactivity dosimeters and other steps are taken to ensure that their safety and health are looked after . 
at the same time scientific studies to this point have not indicated that depleted uranium and illnesses including cancer are in fact related . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans says that he is sensitive to interest of those who rely on the fishery for their livelihood and that he has the authority to regulate the fishery . 
how long will the minister wait before implementing regulations that would have native and non - native fishers fishing at the same time ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are regulating the fishery at this time . 
under the aboriginal fishing strategy we do have native fishing at times , when the commercial fisheries are not in place , through their food fisheries . 
we have those but we have a regular fishery . 
there is one thing I want to make clear on the treaty right , that the long term solution in terms of the treaty right will not be at the expense of traditional commercial fishermen or their families . 
i want to make that clear . 
this is a long term solution that we all have to work with . 
* * * 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , recently there was a report out of the United States suggesting that an antidote given to protect our troops in the gulf war is actually the cause of their ailments . 
is the Minister of National Defence aware of the report and , if he is , what is his department doing about it ? 
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yes , we are aware of the report . 
we are having our consultant , Goss Gilroy , also look at the matter and update the report to us with respect to the matter . 
what is most important is that we look after the health and welfare of our troops . 
we have established post - deployment clinics , gulf war clinics , 1 - 800 numbers , and a centre for the injured and the sick . 
these are all important matters in looking after our troops . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , earlier in question period the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans lamented that Reform does not support his aboriginal policies . 
we have had 132 years of aboriginal policies from the federal government and it has been a litany of failure . 
who has been the governing party for most of the last 132 years ? 
the Liberal of Party of Canada . 
why should anybody trust it to get it right now when it has got it wrong so much in the past ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals are proud of what they have done to build Canada over the last 132 years . 
if the Reform Party continues the way it has been , it will help the Liberals to be in power for the next 132 years .

plutonium IMPORTS 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , at the present time , Transport Canada is studying plans filed with it by Atomic Energy Canada for importing plutonium from American and Russian nuclear weapons into Canada . 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
how can it be that the government is already at the stage of deciding how to ship the plutonium when there has been no public debate on the very principle of importing it ? 
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , no decision has been taken . 
obviously the transportation plans are just now being reviewed and no decision could be taken until Transport Canada makes a determination in this matter . 
we have indicated our agreement in principle subject to that technical approval from the Department of Transport . 
the testing procedure to be conducted at the AECL lab at Chalk River is fully covered by the existing licence granted by the Atomic Energy Control Board , and that licence was granted subject to public hearings . 
* * * 
interest RATES 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the acting Minister of Finance . 
household debt now is at a record 101 % of after tax income in this country . 
we have the highest mortgage rates now in some 42 months . 
i wonder if the minister will screw up his courage and make representation to the Bank of Canada to hold the line on interest rates in this country ? 
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , when we took office , Canadian interest rates were 250 basis points across the board higher than the American rates . 
we will continue to follow those policies . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
contradiction and lack of leadership are consistent traits of the government . 
it has forced non - violent demonstrators to sign a message to the minister on appropriate material . 
there are more than 700 names on this message and it is not a contradiction . 
what will the minister do to protect the fishers ? 
that is the message . 
the Speaker : 
order , please . 
that will bring to a close our question period for today .

business OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to know from the government House leader the business for the remainder of this week and the balance of next week as well . 
i would also like to know if there is room in the agenda for the Nisga ' a debate . 
will time allocation be necessary or will we have lots of room for the Nisga ' a debate ? 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this afternoon , we will proceed with Bill C - 3 , the youth justice bill , which hon. members opposite have been calling for so fervently for the last several days . 
we will see if they are willing to let it go to a parliamentary committee . 
tomorrow , we shall begin debate on third reading of Bill C - 6 , the electronic commerce bill . 
next Monday , October 25 , and Thursday , October 28 , shall be allotted days . 
on Tuesday , we shall commence debate on second reading of Bill C - 9 , the Nisga ' a legislation , introduced earlier today . 
on Wednesday , subject to discussions between the parties , we shall likely begin consideration of Bill C - 8 , the marine conservation areas bill .

points OF ORDER 
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i want to clarify something I said during question period . 
these were hearings of a committee of the provincial legislature . 
also , in answering a question on whether the committee of this House would travel to British Columbia to hold hearings , I said that this was a matter for decision by the committee . 
i should have added that in order to go into effect , such a decision would be subject to consultation among the House leaders and the ultimate approval by this House .

privilege 
CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
the Speaker : 
i will deal with the question of privilege which was raised by the hon. member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley . 
if there are people who want to contribute to this question of privilege , I will hear them . 
i notice that the government House leader does have something to add on the specifics . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today in response to the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley . 
in her statement she referred to the misconduct as she alleges , and general misuse of authority she further alleges , by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in the exercise of extraordinary powers . 
she further noted that in her view CSIS deliberately misled the federal court and frustrated her ability to resolve her lawsuit . 
she alleges that this was done to intimidate her as a member of parliament and it is therefore in her view a breach of privilege and she contends , a contempt of parliament . 
in her statement the hon. member in question raised three broad allegations : one , that CSIS improperly collected and disclosed information ; two , that CSIS took an active and thereby inappropriate role in the preparation of a lawsuit against the hon. member ; and three , that CSIS misused its authority to protect national security and deliberately misled the court , so she said . 
with respect to the collection and disclosure of information by CSIS , document 17 of the documents provided by the hon. member indicates at Q .36 that CSIS was collecting public information to maintain an awareness of current events and public issues that may affect its mandated investigative responsibilities . 
it then disclosed this public - I add public - unclassified information to the plaintiff who , as indicated at Q .10 , was a former employee of CSIS . 
none of the documentation provided any prima facie evidence , in my view , that the behaviour of CSIS in this case was contrary to law nor motivated by any desire to affect in any way the behaviour of the hon. member , let alone intimidate her , in her capacity as a member of parliament . 
any actions taken by CSIS during the course of this private lawsuit were completely unrelated to the ability of the hon. member to perform her duties in parliament , I contend . 
the hon. member may have a complaint about CSIS and of course with time we will judge whether or not that complaint is valid . 
however , on the basis of the evidence submitted , I maintain that any such complaint is not within the realm of parliamentary privilege or contempt . 
the most appropriate vehicle for an examination of this matter is the recourse mechanism established by parliament for all Canadians who disagree with the conduct of CSIS , including its collection and disclosure of information . 
it is our view that the far more appropriate course would be for the Security Intelligence Review Committee , better known as SIRC , to examine this matter . 
this committee was established by parliament to review all complaints against CSIS , including those from members of the House . 
it is composed of a number of distinguished Canadians , including former members of the House , and a person no less than the former House leader from the opposition party . 
in conclusion , I submit that the hon. member has not submitted sufficient evidence to justify a prima facie finding of contempt or breach of privilege but that , if otherwise there is a substantive complaint against CSIS , the proper recourse is to the Security Intelligence Review Committee . 
we believe this process was established by statute law to protect the rights of all Canadians , including members of parliament and that it ought to be properly followed . 
the Speaker : 
as I asserted before , I want to hear direct submissions with regard to this question of privilege . 
i do not want to get into a debate about what was said or what was interpreted . 
i will do the interpretation . 
i will go to the opposition House leader for comment . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like some clarification from the Chair . 
was the member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley given notice that this was going to come up ? 
she is not here to hear what the members in the House are saying about this issue . 
did you make contact with her ? 
the Speaker : 
if the question was posed , this is my statement and not the hon. member ' s , I will not be taking a decision at this very moment . 
it is not my intention to take a decision at this moment . 
i want to review everything that has been said in here with regard to this question of either contempt or privilege . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , my point is if this were a court of law or any other such tribunal in this nation , the individual would rightly be requested or advised to be there . 
the government House leader has made statements which to the individual ' s knowledge may or may not be accurate . 
i think she has the right to hear them . 
the Speaker : 
i offer this as a counterproposal as to what we might do . 
these statements made in the House not only will be made available to the hon. member who raised the question of privilege or contempt , but she will also have time to study them . 
i will go this much further . 
if there is something further she would like to add without entering into a debate per se , but to give me more information on which I could make a decision , then I will wait until I hear from her . 
that the hon. member was not notified is my responsibility . 
it was an error on my part but I did not get the information until just today and I thought it best that we had a response of some kind . 
i did not know the member would not be here , but that is my responsibility and I take full responsibility for this error on my part . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will leave it to the member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley to get a hold of you and go through Hansard . 
i think that is a poor way overall for this to be handled . 
suffice it to say that the points the House leader brought up were covered in the documentation , most of which the hon. member gave to the Speaker some time ago . 
the hon. member is not protesting the fact that it was private litigation against her . 
she has never said that there is anything wrong with that , nor should there be . 
she is not saying that CSIS was able to collect information that was classified or top secret . 
what the hon. member is saying is that after they got the information together , people at CSIS gave to the plaintiff in a private law suit help . 
that information was given to this private individual to conduct a private law suit . 
further , after that the CSIS lawyer was in contact with a private lawyer to a private litigant , the plaintiff in a private case , to help them with their case . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know where the House leader is coming from , but what he is trying to argue does not jibe at all with the facts that the hon. member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley gave you late last week . 
the Speaker : 
that is precisely the point , my dear colleagues . 
i want to review myself what has been said by the hon. member who brought forth either the point of privilege or the point of contempt . 
i will also look at all of the other interventions in this particular case . 
if the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill has something which deals specifically with this point of privilege , I will hear it . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
i , and I am sure all members of the House , as well as yourself , Mr. Speaker , have the greatest respect for the hon. House leader of the government . 
however , as a member of this House I would submit to you that it is not for the House leader to decide what evidence there may or may not be , but for a committee of this House to make that finding . 
the Speaker : 
as I said , I will undertake to review everything that has been said and I will get back to the House in due course . 
national DEFENCE 
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan - Coquihalla on a question of privilege with respect to interference of members of this House by Aldege Bellefeuille , who National Defence memos indicate was a special assistant to the Minister of National Defence and to the assistant deputy minister of finance and corporate services at National Defence , and Mr. David Robinson , former executive assistant to the Minister of National Defence . 
Mr. Bellefeuille ' s role at National Defence was to intentionally delay the issuance of responses to access to information requests from members of parliament in order to prepare the minister for question period . 
Mr. Bellefeuille deliberately delayed this information for reasons that this information was intended for use in parliament by members of the opposition . 
Mr. Robinson interfered with the release of access requests by knowingly issuing an instruction to senior officials at the Department of National Defence to not release access requests until communication needs of the minister had been dealt with . 
Joseph Maingot ' s Parliamentary Privilege in Canada at page 70 defines a proceeding in parliament as follows : 
since two of Parliament ' s constituent elements , the House of Commons and the Senate , were established for the enactment of laws , those events necessarily incidental to the enactment of laws are part of the " proceedings in Parliament '' . 
however , parliament has also always been a forum to receive petitions and the crown ' s satisfying the grievances of members before granting supply eventually led to straightforward requests for information . 
therefore , the events necessarily incidental to petitions , questions and notices of motions in parliament in the 17 th century and today are all events which are part of " proceedings of parliament '' . 
since Mr. Bellefeuille and Mr. Robinson intentionally delayed information with the full knowledge that this information would be used in preparation for question period , they are in contempt . 
on February 5 I wrote a letter to the information commissioner charging that Mr. Bellefeuille ' s position was an unwarranted infringement on the rights of Canadians to obtain information through access to information in a timely manner . 
i made three specific allegations : that Mr. Bellefeuille ' s position caused delay in obtaining records , was political interference and resulted in improper disclosure of access to information in the applicant ' s name . 
on September 30 I received the results of the information commissioner ' s inquiry . 
the investigation took over six months because my allegations contributed to , and I quote from the information commissioner ' s report , " improvements in access to information policies and processes at National Defence '' . 
with respect to delay , the information commissioner agreed that Mr. Bellefeuille caused a bottleneck in the access process as he reviewed 95 % of all requests by the Canadian public . 
this process resulted in delays of several months for documents that were otherwise ready to be released . 
additional delays at the public affairs division of National Defence were the result when Mr. Bellefeuille identified the need for a media line . 
when sent to the minister ' s office , delays of several months were noted while the minister was briefed about the upcoming access to information release and possible response lines for the minister in order for him to prepare for questions by the media and opposition members of the House of Commons . 
with respect to political interference , in addition to the interference caused by the delays imposed by Mr. Bellefeuille , the information commissioner also concluded that the minister ' s former executive assistant , David Robinson , issued instructions to " departmental officials not to answer access requests , no matter how late they may be , until the minister ' s communication needs had been met '' . 
the information commissioner goes on to say : " In my view , this instruction constituted improper interference with the lawful processing of access requests at National Defence '' . 
with respect to disclosure of the identities of access requesters , the information commissioner confirmed that Mr. Bellefeuille had routinely informed the Minister of National Defence of the names of access to information requesters that were members of the House . 
the minister used this information to help prepare for questions . 
the information commissioner concluded that this was not " a consistent use of this information as defined by paragraph 8 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Privacy Act '' . 
the Privacy Act prohibits departments from using or disclosing personal information except for the purpose for which the information was collected . 
the information commissioner said that the minister should not have the name of an access to information requester to avoid the appearance of political influence or bias against the requester . 
the information commissioner said that only the access to information office at the Department of National Defence needs to know the identity of the access requester . 
the minister ' s office should only be informed if it is necessary and only if it is necessary to process the request , and definitely not in preparation for question period . 
since I received this response from the information commissioner it is my understanding that the minister has replaced Aldege Bellefeuille with someone else who will perform a similar function as Mr. Bellefeuille . 
in conclusion , my question of privilege deals with the deliberate delays in information for the purposes of proceedings in this parliament , in particular the scrutiny of a minister in the House of Commons . 
i remind this House that contempt , as Erskine May describes it , is any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either house of parliament in the performance of its functions , or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such house in the discharge of his duty , or which has a tendency , directly or indirectly , to produce such results that may be treated as contempt , even though there is no precedent for the offence . 
i would argue that deliberately delaying information to a member of parliament obstructs the member and the House in the same manner as omitting information or offering misleading information . 
the intent is to obstruct and impede members of parliament . 
Mr. Speaker , if you so find a prima facie case of contempt of parliament , I would also move an appropriate motion so it can be dealt with . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have no idea as to whether the accusation by the member against an official who previously worked there and no longer does is valid . 
that in itself does not constitute privilege . 
if indeed the privacy commissioner , the information commissioner , or both have ruled in this matter , that does not constitute privilege in itself . 
i draw the attention of the Speaker to citation 31 of Beauchesne ' s , which states in part : " The failure of the government '' , if there is such a failure , which I do not admit , " to comply with the law '' , which again I do not admit , " is not a matter for the Speaker , but should be decided by the courts '' . 
if he alleges that someone did not obey the Access to Information Act , or even another statute , that does not constitute privilege . 
there has to be an argument regarding privilege , not as to whether someone obeyed the law per se . 
finally , citation 27 states that a question of privilege ought rarely to come up in parliament and that it should be dealt with by a motion . 
citation 28 states that it is clear that many acts which might offend against the law or the moral sense of the community do not necessarily offend the privileges of the House . 
we really are stretching it . 
if we are going to start saying that every time someone thinks , rightly or wrongly , that an act of parliament , in this case the allegation that something that was judged by an officer of this House , so there was a remedy , constitutes privilege , that is really overstating it . 
the Speaker : 
i want hon. members to stick to this question of privilege . 
please do not go too far astray . 
i do not want to get into a debate . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will not get into the debate as to whether this House leader is right and that one is wrong . 
let me put a little better perspective on what that one said . 
the government really could argue that the minister dealt with the matter , so it is no longer an issue . 
or , there is the argument that members have the option to question the minister in question period . 
or , it could argue that the official is no longer working with us , so it is no longer a problem . 
to address the issue of ministerial responsibility , I draw members ' attention to the Speaker ' s ruling of November 9 , 1978 at page 966 of Hansard . 
the then Speaker said : 
- while I do not think there is a procedural significance to the doctrine of ministerial responsibility , it appears that we are now embarking on a different course in having the House , through a question of privilege , reach around the minister and examine directly the conduct of an official . 
the Speaker went on to say : " It seems to me that it is not a procedural matter '' . 
the Speaker did not consider ministerial responsibility as a consideration when he determined that there was a prima facie question of privilege in that case . 
there is no procedural significance in this case either . 
the gist of the question of privilege today is that someone deliberately impeded a member of parliament from carrying out his duties . 
that is really what this is about . 
the former official committed an act which constitutes a prima facie question of privilege and that act must be considered by the House . 
the House must determine if further action is necessary to protect itself from this sort of activity in the future . 
we should not leave the impression that interfering with opposition members of parliament is a career advancing move . 
last week we had a member of parliament on her feet seeking protection from the House and the activities of CSIS . 
if members are being watched , intimidated or interfered with , and information is deliberately withheld from them , then what is next in the House , Mr. Speaker ? 
that is why we have come to you with the appeal . 
that is all I have to add . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will , in my own small way , attempt to frame this matter of privilege that has been put forward . 
the hon. member knows and all members know that they have the ability in the House to request documents through established procedures in the House . 
in this particular case , it appears that the member did not so request . 
i am advised that from time to time there are dysfunctions and there may well have been in this case . 
if there was a dysfunction in the process , a delay or whatever , I do not think it is correct for a member here to say that a dysfunction in a procedure becomes a matter of privilege just because he or she is a member of parliament . 
that would allow the House procedures inside this place to be cast out throughout the whole country . 
every time there was a dysfunction on a Bell telephone line involving a member of parliament it would essentially be a case of privilege . 
i would not want to deal with the issue of just what happened with the access request in this case or in other cases . 
the Speaker : 
i thank members for their interventions . 
i will review what has been said and I will come back to the House with a decision . 
we will now proceed to tributes for a former Speaker of this House , Mr. Alan Macnaughton , who was the Speaker of the House from 1963 to 1965 . 
* * * 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to pay tribute to a former Speaker of the House , the late Alan Macnaughton . 
Alan Macnaughton was born in Napanee , Ontario , in 1903 . 
he graduated in law from McGill University and after post - graduate study at the London School of Economics he began practising law in Montreal . 
he was a crown prosecutor for many years . 
but more important for us , in 1949 he won his first of six consecutive elections as a Liberal . 
in fact , in the Diefenbaker sweep of 1958 , he was so regarded by his constituents that he was the only English speaking Liberal to win a seat in Quebec . 
after 1958 , Mr. Diefenbaker decided to adopt the British practice of having an opposition member chair the public accounts committee . 
Alan Macnaughton was the first member of parliament who chaired that committee as an opposition member , which he did with great distinction . 
when the Liberals won the 1963 general election , it was not surprising that he was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons . 
he served as Speaker during the Liberal minority government of 1963 to 1965 , a very difficult and fractious period in the House . 
it was marked by such acrimonious debates as the famous flag debate . 
but Mr. Speaker Macnaughton was able to preside over these debates and these tensions with a great deal of skill , tact and diplomacy and was able to keep the House on an even keel . 
many of these reforms came into effect after he left the chair , but he was the precursor , the instigator . 
Alan Macnaughton went on to serve , again with great distinction , in the Senate of Canada to 1978 . 
after he left the Senate , he was active in the business community , but most important , in 1967 he founded the Canadian branch of the World Wildlife Fund . 
i want to conclude by saying that Alan Macnaughton was a person of great warmth and charm . 
he was especially helpful to new members of the House of Commons , as I once was . 
i had the honour of serving in the House with him . 
as an MP , as the first opposition chair of the public accounts committee and , above all , as Speaker , he treated everyone with the greatest tact and courtesy . 
but underneath it all was an essential firmness and a strong belief in the importance of the centrality of our parliamentary institutions . 
he certainly made an impressive mark when it came to the reform of the House of Commons . 
i want to say to his family and his many friends that , on behalf of the government and all MPs on the government side , we want to express our profound sympathies on their loss . 
i want to extend my most sincere sympathies to the family of Alan Macnaughton . 
Alan Macnaughton was a great Montrealer , a great Quebecer , a great member of the House , a great Speaker and a great Canadian . 
his record will live on in the smooth functioning of the House because of the reforms he undertook and the work he did in his years as Speaker . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Macnaughton is remembered as a man and a Speaker who displayed a fairness in his deliberations and rulings , a deep love for democracy and a diligence to his task . 
Mr. Macnaughton was Speaker of the Chamber during some very turbulent and bitter times . 
more than once his quiet but compelling nature pulled proceedings from the brink of catastrophe . 
i had some pages talking about his background , but the Deputy Prime Minister has done that and I will not repeat that because , as a Speaker , he would not want me to be longer than I should be , even in a tribute to him . 
he was a great Canadian and the scope and breadth of Mr. Macnaughton ' s professional activities were impressive . 
he was a former president of the Canada - U.S. Parliamentary Association , the Canada - France Parliamentary Association and he served more than 30 years as a director - adviser to European and American banks . 
he was chairman of the World Wildlife Fund , chairman of the Roosevelt Compobello International Park Commission and deputy chairman of the historic 1973 United Nations Conference on the Environment . 
Mr. Macnaughton also served on many corporate boards after he left Ottawa . 
Alan Macnaughton was a gifted gentlemen . 
his unassuming and distinguished manner was respected by all who knew him . 
as a lawyer , politician , Speaker , businessman and philanthropist , Mr. Macnaughton brought a dignity and a competence to whatever he pursued . 
in 1995 , his contribution to this institution and to his country was acknowledged when he was awarded the Order of Canada . 
there was nothing mediocre about this man . 
the words brilliant , refined , dignified and accomplished will mark his contribution . 
we will all miss him , but appreciate the great job he did for Canada . 
we offer all our sympathies to his family and his friends , and he had many of those . 
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on Friday , we heard of the passing away of Alan A Macnaughton , on the eve of his 96 th birthday . 
he had a remarkably long life . 
his professional and political accomplishments were many . 
he obtained his law degree from McGill University in 1926 and went on to post - graduate studies at the London School of Economics . 
Mr. Macnaughton then practised law in Montreal before being elected to the House of Commons for the first time in 1949 , under the Liberals of Louis Saint - Laurent , in the Montreal riding of Mount - Royal . 
in 1958 , he became the first opposition member to chair the public accounts committee . 
in 1963 , he was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons and , in 1966 , he was called to the Senate where he was to sit until the mid - 1970 s . 
Mr. Macnaughton will be remembered as a highly talented man who is said to have had the greatest respect for democracy and its institutions . 
he will leave his mark as a skilled businessman and an expert in Quebec and Canadian law . 
until very recently , he was still working at his Montreal office . 
on behalf of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues , I would like to extend to his friends and family our sincere condolences . 
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of our party to pay tribute to Alan Macnaughton who was the Speaker of the House from 1963 to 1965 . 
even though I did not know him personally when I came here in 1968 - of course the member for Windsor West was here at that time - I heard about Mr. Macnaughton ' s reputation , which was a very positive one . 
he had a great influence on members on both sides of the House of Commons . 
the reason he stepped aside in 1965 was to make way for a gentleman who some people may have heard of from the riding of Mount Royal , a fellow named Pierre Elliott Trudeau who became the member of parliament for that riding at that particular time . 
when Mr. Macnaughton was the Speaker of the House , we should remind ourselves that it was only for two years but it was during a very difficult time in terms of being in your chair , Mr. Speaker . 
that was the other time in history when we had five political parties in the House of Commons like what you have today , Mr. Speaker . 
this makes refereeing this place a bit more difficult . 
it was also during the days of the famous Diefenbaker - Pearson debates which became rather acrimonious at times and , as I understand , very heated . 
it was also a time when the House had a very divisive debate on the flag . 
i understand the debate went on for weeks and weeks before the days of time allocation or closure . 
Mr. Macnaughton made a very controversial but wise ruling at that time to split the resolution in two . 
he made his mark as a Speaker after only two years in the Speaker ' s chair . 
he was a lawyer and a very successful business person . 
he was a very learned person , a very good academic and a very fine gentleman . 
on behalf of our party I express our condolences to his family and to his many friends . 
he was a great Montrealer , a great Canadian , a great Quebecer and a great member of the House of Commons for 16 years . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to join in paying tribute to the late Alan Macnaughton . 
for those of us who sit in the House today , and as has been previously mentioned by speakers , the late Alan Macnaughton presided over the House at sometimes very contentious times . 
the flag debate , which was a lengthened version of the debate similar to that which the Speaker has presided over , and the pressures that were facing Speaker Macnaughton at that time were certainly historic in 1964 . 
after a distinguished career in law , he pursued his career as a parliamentarian with the same vigour and the same level of decorum and class . 
to him that meant " one who understands human values , who appreciates the importance of high quality , and who knows the need for sacrifices and for putting oneself in the service of one ' s country '' . 
the annals of the House and the Senate as well as the records of the communities which benefited from his charitable work all testify to the fact that Mr. Macnaughton was by his own definition a civilized man . 
he was a man who gave to the world more than he took from it , which fits Governor General Tweedsmuir ' s definition of a true aristocrat . 
we rejoice in Mr. Macnaughton ' s long life . 
the Speaker : 
i will permit myself a few words on this occasion of the passing of a brother Speaker who did indeed preside in this chair . 
about a year and half ago there were eight living Speakers who had occupied this chair and presided over the debates of the House of Commons , but it seems in rapid succession we have lost two of them . 
in July 1998 , Mr. Speaker Lamoureux died very quickly . 
i had an idea for some time to convene the Speakers from wherever they were across Canada just to bring us together to share an evening . 
this is where the human face of Mr. Macnaughton comes into it . 
however six of us did come to the dinner . 
when I called Mr. Macnaughton I said " Speaker Macnaughton , I am having a dinner for the former Speakers . 
would you care to join us ? " 
he said " Oh , yes , I would like to do that ' . ' 
he lived through a great deal , virtually all of this century . 
i was at a hockey game with him in Montreal . 
when I was a boy growing up I said that Rocket Richard was my hero . 
i asked him if he remembered Rocket Richard . 
he said " Rocket Richard ? 
heck , I remember Howie Morenz '' . 
that goes back into the early part of this century . 
all that is to tell you that none of us here except the Deputy Prime Minister had the honour to serve with him . 
i am not sure if the Prime Minister did . 
i take great pride in saying that I am one of the great admirers of Speaker Alan Macnaughton . 
as the hon. member for Regina - Qu ' Appelle mentioned , in a time of turbulence he remained calm and he brought us as a House and us as a nation through the very d é chirant flag debate that we went through . 
i can only reiterate what all speakers today who have taken the floor to remember Mr. Macnaughton have said . 
in my view he was one of our outstanding Speakers . 
he was a wonderful member of parliament and ever so human . 
in your name and in my own name , my colleagues , I extend our very deep condolences to members of his family in their time of sorrow . 
i am always reminded that they did have him and he was with us for almost a century , and that of course is to our benefit . 
government ORDERS 
youth CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , with the consent of the House I would like to split my time with the member for Surrey Central . 
in addressing this bill I would talk about a number of matters . 
the question of what exactly makes young offenders or how do they get to be young offenders always goes through my mind . 
one has to ask these days if it is parents , family problems or an educational system where people fall through loopholes and do not get picked up . 
is it the drugs that menace society today which encourage more and more crime to feed a habit ? 
is it the fact that role models are different today ? 
is it television and all those other things young people watch and are influenced by ? 
or , is it government legislation that more or less encourages or motivates certain things to happen ? 
i would suggest that it is a bit of all of those things . 
having worked with a number of young offenders , it comes out that all these things put together creates a problem in society . 
the job of the House is to try to deal with all those issues and package something called legislation for young offenders that is meaningful and tries to change their ways , if individuals become young offenders , as fast as possible so they do not get too far down the line , become incorrigible , and we end having to incarcerate them . 
i will get something off my chest , to start with . 
i can remember in 1991 setting out things we would like to see changed in the Young Offenders Act . 
we even fought an election in 1992 on that . 
it was not just the Reform Party . 
what particularly galls me is that once the government saw there was a problem it went the route of promotions , public relations and media advertisements saying that it would do something . 
all along since 1993 and here we are in 1999 on the eve of the new millennium still debating this issue in the House . 
it is just amazing to me how the government gets away with that with the Canadian public . 
it is extremely disappointing . 
there is another point I want to make . 
one member from across the way in the Liberal government said that the Young Offenders Act hit on the hard crimes and was lenient on the soft issues . 
the problem with the government and what it does not understand is that it would not be bad if it was one B and E by an individual . 
this is a serious problem . 
in the courtroom today lawyers will say that their young clients do not understand . 
they will say it is simple possession , a minor robbery or a B and E , and the judges say " Yes , I know . 
they do not tend to look at the cumulative effect of consistently not making a serious issue out of it for the individual . 
it is a flaw in the whole issue of justice but in particular with young offenders . 
it is not being addressed here . 
accumulation of numerous minor offences means there is a problem and it is more serious than one minor offence . 
in one year we had 14,035 B and Es from young offenders , 2,077 possession of weapons , 2,338 robberies , and on and on it goes . 
we had 30 murders . 
we must remember that those who murdered probably had a lot of B and Es , a lot of drug charges and so on . 
we failed to deal with it at that level and that is what is wrong with the young offenders philosophy . 
i want to talk briefly about some of the issues in my area in British Columbia that are not being addressed by the bill . 
Joey Thompson of the Vancouver Province wrote : 
overheard during proceedings in the second storey temporary courtroom were artful methods of sucking in a judge , offered by sharpened pros to the cub offenders waiting outside for their case to be called . 
one quick study eventually got before the judge and laid it on thick about how sorry he was for his crimes . 
the judge turned to the citizens in the public pews and delivered a heartfelt speech about the sincerity of the poor lad . 
then he gave him a slap on the wrist and sent him away . 
minutes later , the offender was seen out the window running across the parking lot shouting to his friends , " Hey , it works '' . 
this is what I mean about cumulative issues . 
an article from the Abbotsford News entitled " Team crime rally cry : 
when I ' m 18 , I ' ll quit '' , quoted the police and indicated in part : 
majority of times it ' s the same guys we ' re dealing with , They ' re released on conditions - and although the judges mean well - the kids do not uphold the conditions '' . 
it ' s not unusual to hear a kid say : " When I ' m 18 , then I ' ll quit '' . 
another article entitled " 14 - year - old charged in cocaine sale " read : 
a 14 - year - old Abbotsford girl will be returning to Abbotsford provincial court on March 12 after she was arrested this week for allegedly selling cocaine in Clearbrook . 
it continued : 
under provisions of the Young Offenders Act , the girl ' s name cannot be published . 
another article read : 
on and on it goes . 
another one entitled " Boy too drunk to convict of murder , lawyer says " read in part : 
a 13 - year - old Hobbema boy who beat a cab driver to death with a baseball was too young and too drunk to be convicted of murder , says his lawyer . 
recently a teen in my area pulled a pistol on a police officer . 
it was really an air gun pellet pistol but he could have been shot very easily . 
he was lucky he was not . 
this young fellow was charged but his name cannot be published due to provisions under the Young Offenders Act . 
he was arrested twice in May for threatening to blow up two east Abbotsford schools , and on and on it goes . 
many of the parents were concerned about this . 
they hit roadblock after roadblock after roadblock trying to make sure their school was safe from this young fellow . 
this young fellow ' s parents were good parents but there are problems . 
nowhere today does society look after this young fellow . 
people everywhere want information on this and they are stymied because of the privacy provisions of the Young Offenders Act . 
the government has to deal with reality with young offenders . 
the government has to do it this time . 
we have a litany of suggestions and they are not being addressed . 
we should allow police officers to use discretion in resolving minor incidents without laying charges . 
where have these people been ? 
prior to the next election or maybe in the year 2000 we will be back here again talking about the Young Offenders Act . 
the government has to take better action than it has taken in the past , which has been nothing . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , after the great long police beat report from the west , I would like to make a few comments . 
i would like the member to hear the speech he made . 
he is very critical of cases happening in his own riding or in ridings in western Canada . 
everything he says points to there being a problem . 
i agree with him , there are problems in western Canada , because the Young Offenders Act is not being properly applied . 
this is so true that even in Ontario - he spoke of Mike Harris - a pilot project has just set up . 
there are figures to show that repression has been increased . 
camps where repression is abusive have been established for young people . 
what are the results ? 
thirty per cent of these young people become repeat offenders after their release . 
the opposite is the case . 
young people who have been duly followed under the law and the powers accorded us under the Young Offenders Act are returning to society . 
they are becoming ordinary citizens . 
in Quebec , we do not see the horror occurring in western Canada , which the member has just described . 
the member should perhaps look to see what is happening outside his province . 
i would hope that the Reform Party never comes to power , because their policy on justice would be awful . 
the Reform Party is mistaken , and what I find deplorable is that by crying wolf they have frightened the government , which has given in to Reform Party policies . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , that comes from an individual standing in the House of Commons who wants to separate from Canada . 
is that not interesting . 
i find it ironic that the member may find the Young Offenders Act satisfactory to him in Quebec , but I can assure him that in my area the individuals do not . 
the difference is that the people in my area want me to come here and change it , not to quit and separate . 
we asked for some things in this bill . 
we said that young offenders facilities need mandatory rehabilitation programs . 
does that not sound like a rational thing to do ? 
what does the government say ? 
the government says that with the charter of rights and freedoms that sort of thing cannot be mandated . 
in fact , many young offenders say that if they had a little more discipline in their lives , that if they had been taught the right way , they could have learned a little better and changed themselves . 
but no , the government will not take that step . 
we asked to establish a victims bill of rights under the YOA . 
this was not done . 
we asked that a person who commits two or more violent offences be designated as a dangerous offender . 
this was not considered . 
we asked for the publication of the names of violent young offenders . 
the government left this to the discretion of the courts , in other words , status quo . 
does the government really think that leaving things to the discretion of judges today is a good idea ? 
i cannot believe it . 
if we want good legislation , if we want things to be consistent , then we should have the courage in the House of Commons to say it and do it . 
we should not say , like on the child pornography issue , that we will be a little general about this and we will leave it to the courts to determine whether or not the possession of child pornography should be legal . 
that kind of cop - out is really hurting our country . 
it is hurting the issue of youth crime . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for over 10 years Reform members have been calling for reforms to the youth criminal justice system . 
it has taken at least four years , more like six years , for the Liberals to reach the point where we are at today . 
in terms of changing our youth criminal justice system , it has been 864 days since the current justice minister was appointed to her cabinet position . 
ever since , she has been saying that she would change the Young Offenders Act in a timely fashion . 
i do not know what is timely about 864 days . 
we know that 35 violent crimes are committed each day in Canada and 864 days is a long time for my constituents and all Canadians . 
how many violent crimes committed by youth could have been prevented in the last three years if the government had provided youth crime legislation sooner rather than later ? 
the Liberals spent millions of dollars , had months of hearings and promised for years that it was coming . 
now we have Bill C - 3 , the government ' s proposed changes to the Young Offenders Act , that will create a new youth criminal justice system . 
now we are back in the House debating at second reading stage of the bill . 
it has a new number but it is the same old bill . 
the parents and families of the victims of youth crime become victims too . 
i have two young sons , Mr. Speaker . 
you met with my younger son when he was here . 
when I put myself in the shoes of the hon. member for Surrey North whose family has gone through a tragedy , and when I put myself in the shoes of the parents and families of victims , I feel like going home every weekend . 
i worry because the government is not doing enough . 
i can hardly imagine what it must be like when a young person is a victim of a violent crime . 
the reforms to the Young Offenders Act called for by the public and advocated by Reform have been numerous in detail but the most substantive reforms can be grouped under eight categories which I will discuss . 
there is clarification of the purpose of the act ; strengthening parental responsibility ; recognition of victims rights ; the provision of support services for victims ; stronger differentiation between violent repeat offenders and non - violent first time offenders ; strengthening sentencing provisions ; publication of the names of young offenders ; changes to the age of application in the Young Offenders Act ; and provisions for rehabilitation and prevention . 
to be fair , there are some positive changes offered in the proposals before us but there are areas in which we feel the government has been inadequate or misguided . 
we must continue to urge constructive alternatives and amendments to the act . 
the first category is clarification of the purpose of the act . 
the old juvenile delinquents act made it clear that its primary purpose was the welfare of society , whereas the Young Offenders Act introduced by the Trudeau government focused more on the welfare of the young offender . 
one of the commendable features of the bill is clause 3.1 . 
it states that the principal goal of the youth criminal justice system is to protect the public , a protection to be pursued through the prevention of youth crime through the punishment of convicted offenders and through efforts to rehabilitate . 
that is progress . 
the official opposition has been carrying the flashlight for the Liberals who have been walking in that direction . 
i am happy that at least they got that right . 
however , the bill does not go as far as Reformers would like . 
the Liberals have not seen the full light of day yet . 
with respect to reforming parental responsibility , the bill contains at least two steps in the right direction . 
it requires compulsory attendance of a parent at court if it is considered by the judge to be in the best interest of the young person . 
it increases the penalty for a parent who signs a court undertaking to supervise a young person upon release and who wilfully fails to fulfil that obligation . 
the third category is the recognition of victims rights . 
victims of youth crime are frustrated by the government ' s lack of concern for them . 
the bill before us contains several provisions that represent a step in the right direction . 
for example , clause 52 has the provision to order a surcharge to be levied on any fine payable by a young person . 
i assume these funds are to be used to provide assistance to victims of offences . 
clause 113 permits a youth justice court , a review board or any court to keep a record of proceedings of young persons . 
clause 118 permits victims access to the clause 113 records . 
clause 39 states that the pre - sentence report is to include the results of an interview with the victim . 
these measures fall far short of the demands of the official opposition , supported by this House , for a full - blown victims bill of rights . 
my colleague , the member of parliament for Langley - Abbotsford has already spoken on this . 
i commend him for being the champion on the victims bill of rights . 
on the other hand , the minister and her government still assign a low priority to victims rights in relation to the rights granted to persons accused or convicted of crimes . 
the fourth , fifth and sixth areas of concern to the public and on which we consider the provisions of this bill to be inadequate , are the provisions pertaining to the differentiation of violent offenders from non - violent offenders , the sentencing of young offenders and publishing or prohibiting the publication of the names of the young offenders . 
on tougher sentencing , I believe strongly that our punishment to criminals is just a slap on the wrist . 
on the other hand , if there is no fear and no punishment , that acts as a motivation to commit a crime . 
at this time when there is not adequate punishment , that acts as a motivation for young people to commit crime . 
in conclusion , the bill contains a few steps in the right direction , but falls far short of what we wanted to see in the bill . 
we want a victims bill of rights . 
the Liberals do not want that . 
with respect to the bill ' s provisions for differentiating between violent and non - violent offenders , its provisions for the sentencing of young offenders and its provisions for publishing the names of young offenders , we find there are major deficiencies . 
with respect to changing the age of application of the Young Offenders Act , we think the government ' s approach is wrong . 
finally , the government has not gone far enough with measures concerning the treatment of young offenders , namely , the importance of prevention and the crucial role of the family with respect to youth crime prevention . 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the debate we are having today is rather incredible . 
to quote Albert Jacquard " If a city needs a prison , it means something is wrong in this city '' . 
listening to my colleagues opposite , but mostly elsewhere on this side , I have the feeling prison is the solution for young offenders . 
i was offended a little while ago when my Bloc Quebecois colleague , who is a separatist , gave some credible statistics , but was told he was not making any sense because he is a separatist . 
if I were an Australian , I would still be interested in taking part in this debate because I believe that young offenders must be dealt with the same way wherever you live . 
we all share the same goal , making sure we deal with them in the best way possible . 
statistics show , and I believe we get good results , that prevention is by far better than incarceration and heavier sentencing . 
why are young offenders sent to prison ? 
because they have trouble living in society . 
in prison , they will be thrown in with other people who , for the most part , had trouble living in society . 
so I often think that prisons can sometimes be schools for delinquency . 
instead of punishing them even more , let us do the exact opposite of what is proposed in this bill and try to make them understand what they did wrong and rehabilitate them , so that , once their sentence is served , they can be reintegrated into the community . 
this is what a prison system should do . 
i am very disappointed today . 
a young person who commits a crime probably comes from a tough neighbourhood , from a poor family or maybe a broken family . 
do members really think that , before committing a crime , such a person would stop and think , along these lines " I have to be careful , because under Bill C - 3 I will be given a longer sentence '' ? 
do members think that will stop such a person ? 
let us get serious here . 
this measure will not solve crime . 
i want to put a question to my Reform colleague . 
does he really believe that a young person would stop and think about the consequences before committing a crime . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal : 
Mr. Speaker , either the separatist member does not understand , or he did not listen to what I was saying . 
we on this side of the House are differentiating between violent and non - violent offenders . 
we also emphasize the importance of prevention and rehabilitation . 
the fact is there is no appropriate punishment when the punishment by the court is only a minor slap on the wrist . 
that indicates to our youth that there is no deterrent to commit crime . 
they do not understand the importance of not committing a crime . 
there is motivation to commit a crime because there is no punishment . 
if there is severe or appropriate or reasonable punishment for someone who commits a crime , this will put fear into potential criminals . 
there is a deterrent for them . 
the hon. member should understand that . 
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
i still cannot believe that someone would still say " To solve the problem of crime we just have to put people in jail because that will scare them '' . 
this is beyond belief . 
it is as if these people had never heard of restorative justice , presumption of innocence and the very foundations of modern justice . 
i am really extremely disappointed . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal : 
the government has to have measures in place . 
someone who commits a crime must serve the time . 
if someone commits a crime but does not serve the time , where is the justice ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows : the hon. member for T é miscamingue , Bill C - 6 . 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to speak in support of the government bill dealing with youth issues . 
it is a balancing act . 
in this bill we have seen just that . 
i am extremely delighted to see the approach that has been taken by the minister , in particular the approach dealing with rehabilitation . 
that is the most effective way of dealing with the whole issue of offences in our society . 
it does not make any sense to put all youth who commit crimes or offences in one room and keep them there for 15 or 20 years . 
if at the end of the day we do not do anything with them , when we let them back out on the street , they are going to commit other offences . 
there is no doubt in my mind . 
this government has said there is a price that those who commit offences have to pay . 
in the meantime we have a series of requirements we expect individuals to follow . 
if they follow those requirements and meet the requirements as set out by law , then at the end of the day they will do well for themselves and for society . 
i am delighted with an example in my constituency of Ottawa Centre . 
Debra - Dynes has been an incredible and extremely successful initiative . 
the police force in conjunction with the community , the private sector and youth have set up a team . 
they have approached this whole issue on a team basis , on a joint effort basis . 
the results have been exceptionally good . 
not everything in our society is bad news . 
there is a lot of good news . 
i hope my colleagues in the Reform Party are taking note . 
for example , from 1991 to 1997 there has been approximately a 25 % decline in youth crime in our society . 
that tells me one thing , that what this government has been doing along the way has been good . 
all issues of prevention have served our youth well , have served our society well and have served justice well . 
having said that , there is still a lot of work ahead for us to do . 
there is still very high unemployment when it comes to youth . 
still over 15 % of our youth cannot find jobs . 
we still have a dropout rate of over 25 % of youths who do not finish high school . 
that is tragic . 
that is not just the responsibility of the federal government . 
but it is also the responsibility of the provincial government , municipal government , school boards , parents , of everyone collectively in our society . 
looking at the statistics , in particular when we look at the ages between 16 and 18 , approximately 24 % of all crimes being committed by youth are committed by those who are of age 17 . 
another 22 % of all crimes committed by youth are committed by youths of age 16 , and 30 % of crimes committed by youth are by those over the age of 14 , between the ages of 14 and 15 . 
i say this because I see a huge crack in our system and that is in the definition of a child . 
the definition is that a child who turns 16 can tell his mom and dad goodbye and he is on his own . 
if he comes from a broken family , from a situation where there is abuse at home , the support that exists for him between the ages of 16 and 18 is minimal . 
there is not enough support for our youth , for those in particular who are between the ages of 16 and 18 years . 
those youth are falling between the cracks . 
we define our children in different ways . 
under certain laws we define a child as anyone who is under the age of 14 years . 
under other laws we define a child as anyone who is under the age of 16 years . 
under other laws we define a child as anyone who us under the age of 18 years . 
there is a lack of synchronization and harmonization of our laws , not only federal but also provincial . 
there is a need all across this land for us to say that a child is anyone who is under the age of 18 years . 
by doing so we would be saying to families and to society that they have a responsibility , mandate , role and objective to support children until they turn 18 years of age . 
it would then be society ' s responsibility to support a child from a broken family or an abusive situation until he or she turns 18 years of age . 
by doing so we would have each child either in school , in an apprenticeship program or in vocational training until he or she becomes an adult under the law . 
that is presently not the case . 
when somebody turns 16 years of age he somehow becomes an adult but falls between the cracks . 
as a result we have to follow the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is unequivocally clear that a child is anybody under the age of 18 years and that is the end of it , because it is well known that children need the support of their families , the support of society and the support of the community as a whole until they become adults . 
only then can we treat children as adults and only then can we say they are on their own . 
we have to stand up to our responsibilities and our accountability to the people and to our youth . 
we must have a system whereby we can do all the necessary and important things to ensure fairness and justice in society and to ensure our youth are getting the support they need . 
then we would not have the 25 % dropout rate we have in our schools now for youth between the ages of 16 and 18 years . 
then we would not have the high crime rate that exists for our youth between the ages of 16 and 18 years . 
then we would not have the high unemployment rate for youth between the ages of 16 and 24 years . 
because they are not in the educational system and are not receiving the necessary support from the different levels of government in society they are falling between the cracks . 
we have to commend the government and the minister on their initiatives in trying to put forward an approach that takes into consideration the need for rehabilitation and the importance of prevention . 
an ounce of prevention is worth five tons of cure . 
it is not an easy situation . 
it is an extremely complex but we have to work collectively . 
we cannot hit a kid on the head with a two by four and say that he has to obey the law . 
we must have a cohesive and holistic approach . 
we have to balance the needs of the child and those of society . 
we have to deal with the needs of the child . 
we have to provide the support necessary for the child through the educational system , the family system and society as a whole . 
i am delighted to see the family being asked to get involved when it comes to a child getting in trouble with the law . 
i am extremely excited about the fact that we can tell children through this act that we want them to go to school as part of rehabilitation . 
we want to make sure they do not hang around with gangs . 
we want to make sure they come home every night at 8 o ' clock , 9 o ' clock or whatever time the court may decide . 
by doing so we are going to the root of the problem . 
in a sense that is rehabilitation at the highest level . 
we are required now to tell the child , in particular the one who is at risk , to go back to the educational system , an environment where he or she will receive the necessary support to build a better life . 
that is why I have put over 32 private members ' initiatives before the House asking the government to amend every piece of legislation at the federal level so we can harmonize our laws and change the definition of a child to be anyone under the age of 18 years . 
by doing so we will be sending out a signal saying that a child needs the support of his family and society until he or she is aged 18 years . 
only then can we say that we have done what we have set out to do , and that is to continue to build a better society . 
we have one of the finest societies on earth , but it could be and will be an even better society . 
it is not fair that every year illiteracy costs us over $ 10 billion on a regular basis in terms of lost productivity . 
it is not fair that over 25 % of our population still has difficulties reading , writing or filling out application forms . 
it is not fair that we still have the highest level of unemployment in our youth population . 
it is not fair that we have the highest amount of crime committed by our youth , those between the ages of 16 and 18 years who are without the necessary support required from us collectively . 
to that extent I just want to end by thanking the Minister of Justice for putting the bill before us and for once again putting forward something that is fairly balanced . 
nothing is perfect and the bill will go before a committee . 
it will come back here at report stage . 
it will go through the consultation that is necessary for every bill . 
if somebody somewhere has a proposal , suggestion or amendment that meets the objectives of the bill I am absolutely confident the minister will be receptive to looking at it and if it fits the objectives we will deal with it then . 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , that was an excellent speech in support of the member ' s private member ' s bill in the House of Commons . 
we have to recognize the difference between punishment and rehabilitation . 
when one wants to talk about rehabilitation , which is the most important part of the project when talking about young people , one wants to ensure that people are not left out of the ability to be counselled in the right way and in the right place and to have those resources available . 
the courts or other institutions dealing with young people do not have the option of sending those people for proper rehabilitation because they are not a part of the age group to which the Young Offenders Act applies . 
i would like the member to address that point and to address the fact that it does not matter what we say or do in this place there is an obvious shortage of resources available when we are talking about correcting something that has gone wrong . 
we really need something for many of our children that starts long before that . 
if the hon. member who spoke would like to address those issues I would appreciate it . 
Mr. Mac Harb : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his sensible question . 
if anything , this is what the bill deals with . 
there is a whole notion of the bill that deals with the question of rehabilitation and trying to identify what is best depending on the situation we are dealing with . 
according to the bill we would work in a partnership or in consultation with all the stakeholders , whether we are talking about the provincial government , if they are involved ; whether we are talking about the justice system as we know it , the courts ; or whether we are talking about the communities where there are community initiatives . 
i mentioned the Debra - Dynes project as one example that is being used . 
it is as an extremely successful initiative that is being brought about by the Ottawa - Carleton Police Service Board . 
it is extremely successful . 
when we keep them busy in athletic activities or by getting involved in community projects and other things , we are taking their minds away from doing drugs or getting involved in trouble again or other potential problems . 
those kinds of initiatives are required of us as a society . 
we do not have to always rely on the government to provide and come up with the solution . 
we as a community and as a society have a responsibility to put forward initiatives that could help , could improve the quality of life of our youth , and could ensure that we have a safer community and a better community . 
i am grateful for his question and I am quite pleased with what the government is proposing to deal with the rehabilitation aspect of the issue . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
two things , Mr. Speaker . 
first , it is false to say that Bill C - 3 represents a balance between what the Bloc Quebecois wants and what the Reform Party wants . 
that is simply not true . 
everything the Liberal government put in this bill is designed to meet the objectives of the Reform Party . 
that is altogether another matter . 
second , the hon. member spoke about responsibility . 
on that subject , we can agree . 
one has to be irresponsible to change legislation that works . 
when dealing with legislation that works , the minister ' s responsibility is to try to improve it . 
we are not saying that the Young Offenders Act should be left alone because it is the best act in the world . 
there are things that could be amended , simplified . 
right now , there are cases where young offenders are tried twice , and presumptions of innocence are suffering . 
there are things that need to be clarified and improved . 
however , the entire act should not be scrapped in favour of amendments that could be technical . 
i think the government is getting it all mixed up . 
the system is not perfect . 
the government must not throw out 16 years of experience for the sake of a few votes in western Canada . 
we cannot pass it , because it flies in the face of everything being done in Quebec . 
there is a consensus . 
who do the Liberal members from Quebec represent in the caucus ? 
western Canada or Quebecers ? 
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police , the Canadian Police Association , the Quebec bar association and 18 organizations have formed a coalition against the bill . 
where are the Liberal members from Quebec today , when they should be telling the minister that they do not want this bill ? 
i am sure that , deep down , he does not want to see western Canada throw away all Quebec ' s experience with respect to this legislation . 
Mr. Mac Harb : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague ' s question deals more or less with matters of jurisdiction . 
it is probably best that these issues be dealt with at that stage . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
for example , a member of the Reform Party said that this bill does not go far enough . 
actually , the bill is going in the wrong direction . 
it has already gone far enough , and even too far . 
still , the Reform Party is not satisfied with a bill that is going in the wrong direction , it would like the bill to go even further in the wrong direction . 
let me explain . 
one of the purposes of this bill is the general protection of the public , of course , but its primary purpose is to ensure the welfare of young people who have committed a crime or an offence . 
obviously , we do not want to cheer these young people for their wrongdoings , but we not want to turn them into criminals for life either . 
after all , these are our children . 
they are not strange beings from a distant planet . 
they have been brought up by their parents , here . 
they have been brought up by a community that has , or has not , given them certain resources , of sources of interest , of motivations . 
when they were born , they all had the same opportunities . 
it is not necessarily their fault , very often it is not their fault at all . 
society , the community and their family often have an important impact on how they have turned out . 
fortunately , in such situations , solutions can usually be found . 
as a matter of fact , the Young Offenders Act has allowed us to take action and come up with some positive solutions . 
the rate of repeat offences has also dropped . 
since other laws also give us the means to support a young person having difficulties and help him or her in the rehabilitation process , it is in Quebec that the youth crime rate is the lowest and the rehabilitation rate the highest . 
what we have is a situation that is both rather remarkable and ironic . 
we have in the current legislation everything we need to intervene and help young people reintegrate society in a meaningful and responsible way . 
the current legislation is working . 
however , the Liberal government has introduced a bill that is headed in the opposite direction from the current , which is working and produces results . 
this is reverse engineering . 
this bill is doing the opposite of what allows us to reach the desired goals . 
public security and , more importantly , the rehabilitation of our young people should be at the heart of the bill before us today . 
however , according to every study done so far and all the data we have , this bill is a step backwards . 
it will not help to lower the youth crime rate , nor will it facilitate reintegration or maintain the excellent rehabilitation rate we have now . 
this bill is regressive . 
earlier , a Reform Party member , answering my colleague , the member for Berthier - Montcalm , ridiculed what he had said because he is a sovereignist . 
i am going to tell House something . 
we have the best rehabilitation rate . 
the federal government opposite wants to enact legislation that is going to set us back in the pursuit of this cause , coast to coast . 
if this bill becomes law , it will be one more reason for Quebec to want to become sovereign and to separate from a country that wants to mistreat its children . 
Quebec has followed a very different path over the last 20 years , and since the Young Offenders Act took effect , we have had the best results . 
but the federal government refuses to use legislation from Quebec and the situation in Quebec as a model . 
it refuses to heed the advice of experts from all over the country . 
to win votes in western Canada , a Reform stronghold , it is willing to sacrifice - and this is the right word - our young people with iniquitous and punitive legislation that does not favour rehabilitation and that will not steer young offenders away from a life of crime . 
members will agree with me that this situation is absolutely unacceptable . 
i find it hard to understand how it is that the Liberal government , that usually has a better grasp of these kinds of issues , does not realize that this bill will lead us straight to disaster . 
and if we want the situation to be even worse , we just have to follow the Reform Party . 
but if we want safe communities , where it is possible to rehabilitate young people who have strayed from the straight and narrow so they can become full - fledged citizens , reintegrate society and make a positive contribution to our life , then we must not change the law . 
let us enforce it as it stands now , with all the measures that lead to the full rehabilitation of offenders . 
Quebec has set a good example in this area , and nobody has ever denied that . 
what I am saying has never been denied . 
witnesses who appeared before the committee during the last session explained at length what I have been telling the House for the last few minutes . 
i would like to quote what some people said , because I think it is important for the House to understand that the bill before us is going in the wrong direction . 
i will quote a criminologist from the University of Montreal , Andr é Normandeau . 
this is taken from an article published in a Quebec City newspaper , Le Soleil , on March 13 , 1999 . 
Mr. Normandeau said " People in western Canada '' - he is talking about British Columbia and Alberta - `` always react as they did 20 years ago , at a time when the crime rate increased each year . 
they have kept more of a punitive approach . 
changing the law is the easy way out , but , more importantly , it does not work . 
violent criminals , who represent 10 % of offenders , do not react to coercion '' . 
those are the words of a criminologist . 
he says that the law , as it is now , has worked . 
if we change it in the way the government wants to do now , we will be going in the wrong direction . 
not only will it not work , it will have the opposite effect . 
Mr. Normandeau goes on " The behaviour of prosecutors and police officers in other provinces will influence what goes on in Quebec . 
for instance , a Quebec police officer will quickly start acting like his colleagues from Saskatoon . 
he will then need the same complicity from the crown prosecutors , and then we will end up in a vicious circle '' . 
let me quote from another criminologist , C é cile Toutant , a member of the young offenders sub - committee of the Quebec Bar Association . 
the Quebec Bar Association represents all of the lawyers in Quebec . 
Ms. Toutant is a highly competent professional who knows first hand what is going on in the field . 
this criminologist argued that , even with what the Liberals call the flexibility of the system , the measures that we condemn will be applied . 
she concluded by saying " Why allow what is unjustified ? 
why allow what is inappropriate ? 
in fact , why pass this legislation ? " 
on March 19 , during a press conference of the group of organizations that are concerned with the situation of young offenders , Mr. Jean Tr é panier , another criminologist , and a member of the Barreau du Qu é bec sub - committee on young offenders , also condemned this false flexibility of Bill C - 3 . 
according to him , this so - called flexibility we were talking about before the bill was introduced is in fact a political trap . 
unfortunately , Quebec judges will have to fully enforce the law , since they will not be able to ignore sentences that will be imposed in other provinces . 
in conclusion , because of your legislation , members of the Liberal government , young people from Quebec will not be treated fairly , they will no longer have the opportunity to be rehabilitated , and the safety in our society as a whole will be affected . 
the reason for this is that young offenders who are not rehabilitated become criminal adults . 
we must not forget that . 
of course , prevention is good , but when a young person has committed an offence , rehabilitation becomes essential to ensure the long term safety of the community and to ensure that we have a citizen who will work with us toward social objectives , instead of having one who will be in and out of jail all his life . 
i would also like to tell the House about a representative of the Quebec youth centres association , Andr é Payette , who said it all in a nutshell " It will be a real mess if the bill is passed . " 
what could be clearer ? 
the bill is going in the opposite direction from what should be done . 
i recall what my colleague from the Reform Party said earlier " The bill does no go far enough '' . 
the bill is going in the opposite direction , and that is already too far . 
let me quote also from a court that everybody knows well around here , the Supreme Court of Canada . 
in a recent decision , the court agreed unanimously that too many offenders are put in jail in Canada , particularly native offenders , and that happens not in Quebec but in the central and western provinces . 
the supreme court said that judges should get more involved in reducing the incarceration rate , for the rate in Canada is one of the highest in the western world . 
members do not have to be very good at maths . 
the government wants to lower the age limit to 14 . 
you were once 14 , Madam Speaker . Think about it for a moment : to be behind bars at that age , does it not make the system look a bit stupid ? 
as lawmakers , we should have enough common sense to realize that there are other things to do with a 14 year old to educate him , instead of putting him behind bars . 
we are not in the Middle Ages . 
but when members of the Liberal Party talk that way , I am sorry , but I do not understand . 
somebody somewhere is asleep . 
they should be able to stand up and say " No , wait a minute , it is true , we are going the wrong way , all the statistics show it '' . 
the supreme court tells us that our jails are already too crowded . 
cegeps may not be perfect but , frankly , I would rather send a young person to CEGEP than to crime school . 
when it comes to choosing between helping a young person get back on the right track or seeing him acquire all the skills necessary to remain on the wrong path , common sense dictates that we invest in reintegration . 
this young person who is sent to jail at age 14 and is released at age 17 will go back again at age 18 and will end up in a penitentiary . 
an inmate in a penitentiary costs $ 100,000 a year to taxpayers . 
a social worker hired to look after a number of young persons for two or three years , or a social worker hired to look after teenagers for a time would cost much less , even with full pay . 
they would save money to our society . 
common sense clearly dictates that we invest in reintegration . 
for every dollar invested in reintegration , we will probably save $ 10 in incarceration costs . 
this is about your money and my money but , more importantly , it is about our young people . 
let us use our judgement . 
this bill goes against common sense . 
it goes against human decency . 
it goes against the history of humanity , which seeks to improve the way human beings treat one another . 
the best way to start treating one another properly is to show respect for our children . 
if Canada and the Canadian parliament cannot respect our children , this will be yet another reason for me to separate my Quebec from a country that does not respect its children . 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened with interest to the words from the Bloc member from Portneuf . 
he is a member of the Bloc who I have a great deal of respect for , his separatist bent notwithstanding . 
the member has been to my riding at my invitation . 
i said , with my tongue very lightly in my cheek , that he should see what the best part of the country looks like before he gives it up . 
i have a youth diversion program operating in my riding which has been very successful . 
the last time I spoke with the people running the program , they had run over 100 young people through the program and had only one incident of a repeat offence . 
there is a lot of confusion about what the Reform Party really wants for young offenders . 
our whole approach is divided into three categories . 
the first category is early intervention . 
i believe that is the kind of thing the hon. member supports . 
early intervention would mean interceding early and perhaps preventing people from turning to crime or to some anti - social behaviour that might lead them to crime . 
it helps them to get the right type of assistance and aid . 
we believe that stiffer measures are appropriate for those young offenders who cannot be reached through early intervention , through diversion or through any other way , and who commit violent or anti - social offences over and over again . 
for the protection of society , and for the protection of other young people who are the number one victims of young offenders , we believe there must be stiffer measures for people who assault , rape , break into homes and beat elderly people . 
would the hon. member support the concept of this sort of tri - approach : early intervention ; diversion to keep them out of court and give them a second chance ; and , strict measures for those who will not benefit from the other two aspects and who continue to break society ' s rules ? 
does he agree that we do need to have some tough measures for the worst of the worst ? 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye : 
madam Speaker , I welcome the hon. member ' s question . 
that has been a very beneficial exchange and I have a great deal of respect for this member of the Reform Party who , like several other colleagues of his , is more open - minded . 
however , to answer the particular question he asked me , I will say that , while his position appears to be consistent , the fact of the matter is that the bill would destroy the very foundations of that position . 
first of all , the bill focuses on measures of the third category , which are aimed at the most difficult cases . 
it is clear that it puts less emphasis on measures of the first and second categories . 
so , if less emphasis were put on these measures , that is on the care of young people convicted of minor offences , if fewer efforts were made in that respect , these young people run the risk of committing more serious offences for lack of help . 
they will then be facing measures of the third category because they will have become difficult cases . 
what the bill will do is merely create more difficult cases . 
following this reasoning , the present legislation would have to be retained so that all of the emphasis may be put on the first two measures , in order to have a minimum of individuals move on to the third . 
and now what can be done with that group ? 
the last thing we want to do - and I am sure that my colleague from Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan agrees with this - is to block their rehabilitation . 
if not rehabilitated , when they are back on the street , the semblance of security we enjoyed for the two , three or four years of their incarceration will blow up in our faces when they do get out again one fine day and , instead of being rehabilitated , are really hardened criminals . 
the tougher the cases , then , the more needs to be invested in rehabilitating them . 
this is the only way , not just to ensure the safety of our communities , not just to save money , but also to save the young person himself . 
the arguments being used by my colleague for Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan are exactly the opposite of the laudable objectives he wants to pursue . 
he must realize this . 
in Quebec we have demonstrated the right way to apply the Young Offenders Act in its present form . 
i would invite him to come back to my riding with me and I will show him directly how well things are working . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , today , I have heard all sorts of arguments in the House . 
there were those who thought that a person almost had to be put to death to be properly rehabilitated . 
then there were those who said that these young people had to be put behind bars if we wanted them to be allowed back into society , but that there was no certainty they would be rehabilitated in jail . 
i also heard people , such as the member for Berthier - Montcalm and the member for Portneuf , who explained what needed to be done for our young people , for young offenders . 
the focus needs to be on rehabilitation if we want to help them improve their lives . 
we are legislators and we want - I think that this is what all members here want - to improve society . 
i do not think that a bill such as this is going to improve society . 
i have attended the opening of courts in my region . 
i think we have the deaf talking to the deaf . 
i do not think that a bill such as this is going to help them . 
i appeal to all parliamentarians here today to think carefully about what is going on with respect to this bill and to remember that we are considering a bill for the future . 
the young people of today are the citizens of tomorrow and we cannot jeopardize their future . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye : 
nonetheless , I would like to say that this bill is quite different from many bills introduced in the House . 
when the subject is a treaty with aboriginals , it is important . 
when the subject is legal issues , it is important . 
when the subject is international treaties , it is important . 
i appeal to the good judgment of all members and , especially of government members , in particular those from Quebec , in the hope that they will bring the Liberal government back to its senses and convince it to withdraw this bill , which goes against the interests of our children . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , I must say that it has been a very interesting day today listening to a variety of points of view on this legislation . 
i think it is fair to say that we are all pleased that the legislation is finally before us . 
there has been a feeling in the land , generally , that the Young Offenders Act needed improvements . 
i think there is almost unanimity among members in the House of Commons that this debate is long overdue . 
i hope we can move this debate along quickly today and into committee where we can get into some of the concerns that have been raised by so many . 
if I can generally summarize my party ' s position , it is that we see this bill as a major step forward , and I will explain why I say that in a moment . 
however , we also have some serious concerns . 
i think they are very legitimate concerns and I want to articulate them very clearly because there is a role for opposition members , although it is probably distorted in the public ' s mind generally as simply to oppose things for the sake of opposing , that we are opposition and we are against everything the government does . 
bill C - 3 is formally called the youth criminal justice act . 
we are starting from a whole new approach , youth justice . 
i want to take a few moments at the beginning of my presentation to read from the introduction of the bill itself because to me it summarizes what it is we are trying to do today . 
it states that Bill C - 3 is an act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and that it will amend and repeal other acts . 
the preamble reads : 
whereas society should be protected from youth crime through a youth criminal justice system that commands respect , fosters responsibility and ensures accountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration , and that reserves its most serious intervention for the most serious crimes and reduces the over - reliance on incarceration for non - violent young persons ; 
whereas these objectives can best be achieved by replacement of the Young Offenders Act with a new legal framework for the youth criminal justice system ; 
whereas members of society share a responsibility to address the developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and to guide them into adulthood ; 
whereas communities , families , parents and others concerned with the development of young persons should , through multidisciplinary approaches , take reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by addressing its underlying causes , to respond to the needs of young persons , and to provide guidance and support to those at risk of committing crimes ; 
and whereas Canada is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and recognizes that young persons have rights and freedoms , including those stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights , and have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms ; 
now , therefore , Her Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada , enacts as follows : 
that is what this whole bill is about . 
in anticipation of this debate and the work that will take place over the next number of weeks , I consulted a group of people in my constituency . 
i went into the jails and talked to young people who were incarcerated . 
it was an interesting experience because I had not spent a lot of time visiting jails . 
i chatted to young people in halfway houses and , in general , to young people who were in some form of confinement . 
there were young people who were being treated in various treatment centres for addiction problems and so on . 
i talked to young people on the streets of Kamloops who were practising young offenders . 
i met with police officers , parole board representatives , probation officers , judges , lawyers , criminal justice advocates , correction workers and others who had in some way come in contact with young offenders . 
i asked all of them what they thought was the fundamental reason for some young people becoming young offenders , because most do not . 
i think we would all agree that if we talked to young people across the country almost all of them would not be young offenders . 
however , there are a few people who do get into trouble with the law . 
i asked all of these people if there was some commonality , if there was some reason or if they could give me a summary as to why these young folks got into trouble . 
almost everybody said , more or less , two things . 
one was that these folks got caught . 
they are caught but found not guilty . 
the ones who are in jail were caught . 
that was a small point . 
the second point was that almost everyone agreed that one of the fundamental causes of young offenders in our society is poverty . 
somewhere in their past , their parents , their guardians or they themselves had lived for a period of time in some form of serious poverty . 
they did not have the things that most kids want and have . 
they were on their own to fend for themselves . 
those of us who have raised children or know children well all appreciate that it is tough growing up . 
there are pressures from peers and many other pressures . 
if they have no one to guide them , to direct them , to care for them , to nurture them or to give them a helping hand , it is no wonder they get into trouble . 
i am not suggesting that if they are poor they are going to get into trouble . 
obviously there is no correlation there . 
the correlation is that almost all of these young people , if traced back , had some element of poverty in their family ' s past . 
that is a crucial factor . 
many of us were here in November 1989 when Ed Broadbent posed a motion , seconded by me , that we would do whatever was necessary to eradicate child poverty in Canada in the next 10 years . 
it was a very laudable goal . 
i see many of my friends opposite who were here and remember that time . 
first , we set a goal which was to eradicate child poverty in Canada in the next 10 years . 
we did not do too well . 
as a country , one area where we have to hold our heads down in shame is that we failed in reaching that goal . 
let us understand that the reason those young people are living in poverty is because their parents live in poverty . 
we do not have poor children living in rich homes . 
because of that poverty good housing and support are often not there . 
as we deal with this new version of the Young Offenders Act and concern ourselves with assisting young people , particularly those who are on the edges of trouble , let us acknowledge that we cannot simply do this through this legislation . 
other initiatives are required as well , such as alleviating poverty in our country , particularly child poverty . 
there are some people in our country who assume that child poverty is a reality , that nothing can be done about it , that there is always going to be 5 % of the population which is poor and that is just the way the world is . 
however , that is not the way the world is in some parts . 
there are countries where there are no poor children . 
there are no children living in poverty because there are no parents living in poverty . 
those countries exist . 
it is possible to eradicate poverty and it ought to be a laudable millennium goal for us to have . 
we should eradicate child poverty in our country . 
based on whatever kind of questionable statistics or images , a lot of people do not feel that society is a safe place today , particularly elderly people who watch the news on television . 
every bad kid in the world gets front page coverage , so we get the impression of one large madhouse with thousands of people killing , raping and murdering . 
in fact the opposite is true . 
by and large the rates are going down in our country in terms of violent crime . 
however , because of instantaneous communication and the fact that people watching television are not sure if the young people are from Canada or the United States , or from other countries , there is a sense that we are living in an increasingly violent society . 
people feel unsafe in their homes . 
there are instances , of course , where that is the case and people have committed heinous crimes , but we must keep in mind that these are isolated incidents . 
i listened carefully to my colleague who represents a riding close to mine . 
he spoke about the intervention programs that have been successful in his constituency . 
i could name a number of programs that have been very effective in the Kamloops region in diverting young people away from a life of crime , which carry out all sorts of parole practices that result in people not reoffending . 
my friend talked about his experiences in Trail and Castlegar , British Columbia where the intervention programs have been very successful . 
i appreciate that kind of information . 
we have to create the impression that we are talking about a very small group of young people who get into trouble . 
most of them , if dealt with properly in the justice system , do not reoffend . 
they learn their lesson , smarten up and do not do that type of activity again , whether it is stealing a car , breaking into someone ' s house and stealing a VCR or whatever . 
we would all acknowledge the fact that there are young people , very few in number , who really have to be set aside so that society is protected from their behaviour . 
those are the ones who we want to see in our jails . 
there are a lot of people in jails who , quite frankly , we do not have to be protected from . 
if a guy has been writing bad cheques time and time again , do we really have to pen that person up in a cage ? 
i do not think we do . 
our friends from Quebec have been pointing out the success they have had in dealing with young offenders in that province . 
in terms of young people who re - offend , the province of Quebec has probably had the greatest , most impressive track record of any other province or territory and we have to acknowledge that . 
Quebec has made tremendous advances in the area of native justice , particularly native youth justice . 
i spent about four or five days on the Navajo reservation with a number of lawyers and judges and sat in on a number of sessions . 
i will explain how that worked . 
it was absolutely marvellous . 
one day little Johnny stole a VCR from a neighbour ' s house on the Navaho reservation . 
he was charged and the day was set for his court hearing . 
the old judge got up there and asked " Johnny , how do you plead ? " 
the kid was kind of mumbling . 
" speak up '' , the judge told him , " so all the court can hear you '' . 
" not guilty , sir . " 
" okay '' , said the judge . 
it was something to see , Madam Speaker . You should have seen it . 
" speak up '' , said the judge . 
the reply was not clear so the judge said " Speak up '' . 
" she is probably not very happy with me , " said Johnny . 
the judge said " Tell me some more '' . 
the judge then went to the mother , the father , the cousins and brothers and sisters , and they were all embarrassed by this kid ' s activities . 
they said his actions were inappropriate . 
they were sorry and embarrassed that their grandchild or brother had behaved the way he had . 
by the time they had gone through the entire extended family , the little kid was just like a melted pile of wax . 
he was beaten up , feeling like a complete idiot and wondering what he had done . 
obviously he was found guilty . 
what was the sentence ? 
he had to do some community work . 
every day after school for six months he had to take a plastic bag , go around the reservation and pick up paper until he filled the bag and then leave it at the judge ' s house door each night before he could quit . 
in the centre of the Navaho reservation the pueblos have a central area where people hang out . 
every Saturday he had to sit on a chair by himself from sun up to sun down in the middle of the reservation . 
nobody could talk to him but everybody would know who little Johnny was . 
they would have to keep an eye out for him because he steals things from his neighbours and friends . 
they all figured out who he was . 
he had to do that for a certain length of time . 
an hon. member : 
what would have happened had he stolen two VCRs ? 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
my friend asks what would have happened if he had stolen two VCRs . 
i have no idea but anyway this was an interesting sentencing . 
i think there were a couple of other things added on to that but I have forgotten . 
the long and the short of it is that the judge said young Johnny would never be back in his courtroom ever again . 
why ? 
it was because he realized the impact of his misbehaviour on his family , community and friends and that it was not the way to behave in a decent society . 
we have all been there . 
we have all done things in our life for which we feel kind of stupid because we did not think about them . 
when one thinks about it , one does not do it . 
the judge guaranteed that young Johnny would never return to the courtroom again because he learned a lesson . 
when I read the legislation this is what the bill is all about . 
it looks to the various types of sentencing . 
rather than just saying the guilty party goes to jail for 40 days or 40 years or whatever it give the judges some discretion . 
let us face it . 
every case is different . 
every kid who is out committing some kind of a crime , gets caught and goes to court is different . 
every victimized person is different . 
the circumstances are different . 
that is why I oppose what my friends in the Reform Party are suggesting , that we should not give the judges that kind of discretion . 
that is why we have judges . 
that is why they are there . 
that is why we have them . 
otherwise we would not need judges if we just had straight laws and so on . 
my friends in the New Democratic and I have a concern . 
if we are to have all these creative systems to rehabilitate young people who have gone off the edge or try to get people redirected back into the mainstream of society , those who the judge deems can be , we need financial resources to have those systems in place to follow through with that . 
we have to have the money for the parole system , the community action groups and the community organizations to ensure those young people can be rehabilitated by carrying out the judges sentencing . 
there is a major flaw in the legislation . 
i may be wrong , but from what I can gather there are only $ 260 million over three years . 
that is a drop in the bucket . 
it will not solve the problem . 
we can have all the great rhetoric , all the great ideas and all the great plans in this legislation possible , but unless we have the financial resources to give to support that system it will fail . 
for that reason I am loath to say that we have to oppose the bill at this stage . 
we agree with the theory . 
we agree with the thrust . 
it is a major step forward , but we cannot handcuff our judges , handcuff our parole boards and handcuff community groups that want to help young people . 
are they to say they are sorry and do not have any money for them ? 
obviously there are a number of other items that we should identify as problems . 
my colleague who spoke earlier certainly did that with some eloquence . 
Mr. Ren é Canuel ( Matap é dia - Matane , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I listened attentively to my colleague , and he caught my ear when he said " We must talk about poverty '' . 
nobody is born a delinquent '' . 
i have an answer , and I would like everyone to listen . 
if one becomes a delinquent , it is obviously for one of many reasons . 
the most important reason could be that the delinquent was not loved enough or not loved at all . 
it has nothing to do with the young person ; it depends on whether the family circle give that person the most important thing in life , love . 
when someone grows up surrounded by hatred and violence , there is little doubt that that person is going to become a delinquent . 
is it possible to legislate an end to the problem ? 
absolutely not . 
we have to take this young person and introduce him to somebody who is going to love him . 
it might be a streetworker , someone who works for the social services or a friend . 
by friend , I do not necessarily mean another young person , it could be a teacher or a friend who will take him under his wing . 
i will give an example . 
in France , a man called Guy Gilbert takes in certain delinquents on his farm . 
there are a number of animals there : deer , cows , pigs , chickens and others . 
the young delinquent chooses an animal , and the animal is his . 
he is made to understand that one does not hurt animals . 
if he understands that , how will he be able , later on , to hurt an old lady just to get $ 50 ? 
he will have understood . 
very few come back or go back to prison because they have understood that if they are not to mistreat animals , they are certainly not to mistreat a human being . 
we have to think in terms of prevention . 
and I submit that we have to put up the money , especially at the elementary level . 
even in elementary schools children aged six , seven or eight are sometimes tough , very tough on others , almost violent . 
i hope my colleague is now going to tell me he favours prevention over a more drastic measure . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
madam Speaker , I do not know if I can add much to what my hon. colleague has just said . 
he has identified what he believes is a fundamental cause of misbehaviour . 
i would have to agree with him . 
perhaps I can add another point for thought . 
i think the hon. member was asking us to think about this matter . 
i am a parent . 
i am just going to stand in my place and pretend that my hon. colleague from Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre is my child . 
Mr. John Solomon : 
he will have to use a lot of imagination . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
that is quite a leap . 
when a child misbehaves a lot of parents whack him . 
let us just think about it . 
the person who loves him is hitting him . 
i would say that is the way a lot of violence begins . 
the reality is that if the people children think love them keep hitting them day after day , month after month , year after year , and then say to the children that they should not hit other kids it is a little hollow and hypocritical . 
rather than hit people we need to comfort them . 
i think I have made my point and I would like to thank my colleague for his intervention . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , I should remind the hon. member that we have a rule here against the use of props . 
the debate is going along quite well this afternoon . 
the hon. member touched on a number of the diverse elements behind the legislation , but I personally think the important part of the legislation is its enhanced access to what I would call adult measures . 
the hon. member mentioned , as did previous speakers , the need for intervention , diversion , alternate measures and sanctions for young offenders . 
with the experience we have had in the last 15 years with the Young Offenders Act in many provinces but not all there has been a need , a request and an indication from Canadians that there is a need for enhanced access to new tools and firmer adult measures in some cases . 
that is an important readjustment in the current statute . 
it provides access to those even though in some provinces , and not just Quebec , there have been good results with the existing legislation . 
i want to ask the hon. member if he accepts that principle . 
we may be running out of time and ability to respond , but I would leave the question on the floor . 
does the member agree to disagree conceptually or otherwise with the thrust of the bill in providing access to courts that needed it or to judges who felt they needed access to potentially harsher and firmer adult measures ? 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
madam Speaker , I appreciate my hon. friend ' s intervention which was made in a thoughtful way as usual . 
i must admit that I was not listening to his question . 
i am sure it was a good one , but I am afraid any kind of answer I would have would sound a little bit silly . 
i would say that yes is probably the appropriate answer knowing the kind of questions he normally asks . 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I have one comment and perhaps a question for the hon. member from Kamloops . 
i trust he is listening this time . 
he gave a very graphic example and demonstration that we all feel toward his colleagues from time to time but he has had a chance to vent . 
his demonstration was well put . 
hitting a child repeatedly on a day after day basis may create a tendency toward violence . 
i would hope that we in the House do not confuse child abuse with a swat on the backside at the appropriate time when other measures have not been effective or when a parent deems that to be effective . 
it would not be on a daily basis nor repeatedly hitting a child each time the child says something wrong , looks the wrong way or whatever . 
there is a time and a place for everything . 
we should not take that completely out of the hands of parents , especially when we tell them that we want to hold them responsible for the actions of their children . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
madam Speaker , that thoughtful question deserves a lot more attention than it is going to receive today . 
one could make the case that there is little evidence available to suggest that violence of any kind is ever helpful . 
i know my friend and some of us might think it is , but we have to look at hard evidence . 
what evidence is there that striking a young person , in particular a little person , actually changes or modifies that person ' s behaviour ? 
i will use one example . 
i train horses as a hobby . 
there are two approaches to horse training . 
there is the violent approach which is called breaking animals . 
you break a horse . 
the horse ' s spirit is broken and then it decides to follow along with what you want it to do . 
the Horse Whisperer , the individual we are probably all familiar with from movies and so on , trained the horse to do whatever he wanted it to do through kindness . 
there is little evidence to suggest that violent horse breaking is better than kindness horse breaking , but we can discuss this matter further . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , there will be no violence in the Progressive Conservative caucus . 
the New Democratic Party , in distancing itself from its previous policies of pacifism today in the House of Commons has surprised and shocked all of us . 
it is a sad day for democracy in Canada . 
i hear regularly from people in my riding who are affected by and concerned about the current or previous act . 
it is important for us when developing public policy to focus on reality and not simply perception . 
it is sometimes said that perception is reality , but sometimes reality is reality . 
far too often in the House and in politics we focus public policy on the perceptions of a situation as opposed to the reality of the situation . 
there is an increasing trend for governments and political parties to focus action , public policy and legislation on what the pollsters are telling them to do . 
of course polls are based completely on public perception as opposed to reality . 
i am concerned that in doing so , sometimes we overlook the more significant and root causes of some of the problems we try to fix with very simple solutions . 
American humorist H . L . Mencken once said that for every complex problem there is a simple , clean , precise solution that is wrong . 
sometimes we in this House come up with some solutions that simply do not address the holistic and root causes of the problems we are trying to deal with . 
crime is often very much linked to opportunity or lack thereof , and particularly lack thereof is linked very closely to poverty . 
if we are going to deal with the issue of youth crime in a significant and long term way , we need to deal with some very important economic issues in Canada . 
in Canada there has been an 8 % drop in personal disposable income since 1990 . 
on the other hand , in the U.S. there has been a 10 % increase in personal disposable income . 
that parent is faced with trying to provide for the household , trying to provide an adequate level of income for the household , and at the same time is trying to be an effective parent by devoting not just quality time but the quantity of time necessary in raising children . 
the difficulty I have with some of the band - aid approaches taken by this government is that far too often we are ignoring some of the real solutions . 
there are examples both in the U.S. and Canada of very successful headstart programs which have achieved a great deal . 
the Fraser Mustard studies have demonstrated that $ 1 invested in a child in a high risk situation before the age of three can provide a return to society of $ 7 by the time the child is 30 . 
that return is based on the savings to society on the police system , the judiciary , and in the worst case incarceration , social welfare expense , the expense of dealing with somebody who has fallen between the cracks . 
the first three years are the most important years in a child ' s cognitive development . 
ninety per cent of a child ' s cognitive adaptive skills actually close off after the age of three . 
it is ironic in dealing with perceptions as opposed to reality that those who develop public policy on the education front , particularly on the provincial side , tend to focus on higher education and on secondary and primary education and they tend to ignore an important area , the preschool area . 
quite possibly it is a step in the right direction for the government to indicate in the throne speech that there will be more generous EI benefits for new parents . 
that is a step in the right direction but again , it only addresses part of the problem . 
certain types of youth activities are important in providing a way for young people to meaningfully spend their time . 
recreational activities such as hockey , softball , 4 - H or scouts are all wonderful activities that come with a price . 
any parent who has outfitted children in hockey in recent years will attest to this . 
for Canadians who have outfitted their children in sports gear , it is a very expensive pursuit . 
whether it is registration in the leagues or buying equipment , there are barriers . 
parents in many cases lack opportunity and adequate income levels and therefore children lack opportunities to pursue the types of self - actualization and important activities that can prevent them from pursuing crime . 
i represent primarily a rural riding . 
the fact is that for rural poverty and urban poverty the demographics are strikingly similar . 
in many cases substance abuse , spousal abuse , child abuse , all these issues are linked very closely to poverty . 
it is ludicrous that we are taxing individuals making $ 7,500 per year which makes it even more difficult . 
my colleague , the member of parliament for Shefford , has co - chaired the PC task force on poverty and has travelled throughout the country . 
i have travelled with her on some of those trips to speak with and learn from those most directly affected by poverty . 
the growth and pervasiveness of poverty in Canada has never been greater . 
the member from Kamloops quite rightly identified the motion from 1989 to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000 . 
parliament ' s lackluster performance in meeting that motion indicates a focus on perception and not on reality . 
we should be delivering on some of these things . 
the best way is to create more economic opportunities to provide Canadians with opportunities to succeed and prosper and thus provide Canadian children with an opportunity to actually break out of the poverty cycle . 
the poverty cycle is important . 
there is a fine line between programs that benefit families and children and programs that create a cycle of dependency . 
it is important that we become more innovative in the types of social policy solutions we are seeking in preventing that cycle of dependency which can be so pervasive and deleterious in the long term . 
some elements of the legislation are very positive , such as those which deal with parental accountability . 
the notion of bringing parents into the courtrooms to deal directly with the questions of where they were at a particular time or why they had not taken a greater level of responsibility over the action of the child is very important . 
there has to be parental responsibility and that has been sadly lacking the past . 
it can help significantly if parents and family members play a role within a judicial framework in this regard . 
i am concerned relative to the cost of implementation of the bill . 
it will be largely borne by the provinces . 
ultimately there is one taxpayer . 
ultimately provinces that are enjoying less economic growth at this time will be put in a very difficult situation to try to pay for some of the costs of compliance with some of the provisions of the legislation . 
it is important that parents become more accountable . 
we are not suggesting that jailing parents would improve the situation , but we should recognize the importance of parents playing a role not just within the realm of a courtroom but on an ongoing basis . 
i enjoyed the member from Kamloop ' s comments . 
one thing he mentioned was that in his study of the issue in his riding , many of the young people who were incarcerated or who were in various stages of rehabilitation had mentioned that the only thing that differentiated them from someone else or one of their peers was that they happened to get caught . 
i think there is a fair bit of truth to that . 
i think there are a lot of young people who do end up running afoul of the law but are not of a criminal bent . 
these young people will do what young people sometimes do because of the intrinsic sense of mischief that exists . 
it is very important that we find ways to identify those people and find ways to deal with them relative to the crimes they have committed as opposed to those who actually demonstrate sociopathic tendencies and are capable of far greater crimes . 
the opportunity to rehabilitate someone who has committed a crime of mischief or an aberrational offence will be far greater than it will be for someone who has more of a psychological profile of a criminal . 
it is also important that we work with parents in a preventative sense and in a more holistic sense . 
we need to identify and assist parents in developing the types of parenting skills that are necessary . 
i happen to believe that provinces are , in many cases , better at some of the preventative remedies than the federal government . 
part of that involves constitutional and jurisdictional boundaries , but the provinces would be far closer to the actual situations , particularly in terms of strategic social investment , than the federal government would be . 
i hope that as part of that policy we will seek to identify some of the situational commonalities between those that ultimately end up falling afoul of the law . 
i think we will find significant overlap . 
that links very closely to economic factors and opportunities . 
it is difficult enough for parents who have a relatively good income to raise children . 
it is an increasingly complicated , difficult and challenging world . 
for parents who do not have adequate income and do not have economic opportunities , it is evermore difficult . 
we must be extremely careful to balance social policy and economic policy . 
we must recognize that while all of us probably agree on the end , some of us differ on the means to get there . 
we use the justice system to deal with our young people as a way to deal with those people who have fallen through the cracks , but ultimately , this place and all the provincial legislatures in the country should actually be preventing and reducing the number of young people who do end up falling through the cracks . 
we would all be better served by that . 
it would involve dealing with the realities of the situation and the root of the problem . 
one of the best headstart programs in a Canadian context operates out of Moncton , New Brunswick . 
the Minister of Labour spent a great deal of her life working on building that headstart program and deserves credit for her contribution to Moncton and to Canada . 
i am certain that program has resulted in significant change to the lives of those children who have gone through that headstart program . 
goodness knows how many young people have had their lives and directions changed based on participation in that program . 
how many parents are now proud of their children and the young people they have raised partially because of the assistance of that program ? 
it is very important that we take a look at not just examples of headstart and early intervention programs in Canada but also examples that exist around the world , particularly in inner city communities in the U.S. that have pursued some of these things . 
it is also important to create a culture of responsibility through the education systems in Canada . 
this can be difficult because the justice system is largely federal and youth criminal justice is a piece of federal legislation . 
however , we are dealing with a problem that emanates , to a certain extent , from education and could potentially be ameliorated , diverted or improved by a better educational focus on areas of responsibility . 
there is a requirement for better provincial and federal co - operation in some of these areas to ensure that , across the country , provinces are pursuing education systems that teach a little bit about responsibility . 
how about citizenship ? 
these are all things that can be achieved if there is a co - operative effort to deal with the realities and the root causes of the problem and not always with the big stick approach at the end . 
while we are pleased that the government has gone a ways toward improving the youth criminal justice with this legislation , we are not satisfied that it has gone far enough in certain areas . 
on the real root causes of the problem , we do not think that the government has really done an adequate job of approaching those issues . 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , my Conservative colleague mentioned the roots of criminality . 
this is one of the main issues we have to address when dealing with youth crime . 
what is the root of the problem ? 
we have heard some interesting arguments linking the increase in crime to the increase in poverty . 
unfortunately , in the bill now before the House , instead of looking for the roots of criminality , the government is going for a bandaid solution , not a proper solution . 
the problem is that this young person , instead of being rehabilitated , going to school and becoming a good citizen , will be sent to prison , a school for crime , where he will be in contact with confirmed criminals . 
my concern is that , when he is released , he will be even more frustrated with society . 
how could a young man have respect for society when he feels he does not get any respect from it ? 
i do not want to be too categorical , but I think that in that school for crime , his frustration with society will just build up , and he will learn more about crime . 
when he is released , he will probably be a much better criminal . 
this debate is very important . 
i am concerned when I hear some people say that young people should be punished more harshly . 
but I do understand the basic philosophy of the Reform Party . 
i know many members of that party have been involved with or have themselves been victims of young criminals . 
i can understand the frustration . 
that reaction is quite normal , but I wonder what the consequences would be for society and for young people . 
a few moments ago , a member talked about prison systems in aboriginal communities . 
there are alternative measures that have not been examined carefully enough . 
they could yield better results than the Reform proposals , which , unfortunately , have found favour with the government . 
i do not know if most members of the Liberal caucus believe in this approach . 
i hope this is not the balanced approach mentioned by the government , leaning to the left on some issues , leaning to the right on others , and all that to score political points . 
i hope the Liberal members opposite are truly convinced this bill will improve society by putting more young people in jail , by treating them like adult criminals when they are not always fully aware of the seriousness of their actions . 
i think this is not the way to increase that awareness . 
Mr. Scott Brison : 
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
he has been very articulate and vigilant in speaking passionately about the young people in poverty in Canada and the fact that typically in the House we do not really deal with some of the deeper issues which deal with that reality , as opposed to the perception . 
in fairness to the government , this legislation deals with justice . 
it is very limited in terms of the scope it can take to address some of those issues . 
we need to spend more time pursuing some of the social and economic policies that can help reduce the poverty and dependence that can lead to it . 
it was interesting that he mentioned the issue of natives and the penal system in Canada . 
the situation exists as well in the U.S. where there is a disproportionate percentage of visible minorities in the penal system . 
part of what happens in both countries is a systemic racism that reduces opportunities for minorities . 
then there are opportunities through archaic drug laws that create a loophole for people to make money . 
if we look at the history of organized crime , or go back to prohibition , typically those who participated in organized crime were of an ethnic background that denied them opportunities in the mainstream . 
they sought opportunities where they could find them . 
in some cases those opportunities came to them because the government had laws that did not make sense , whether it was prohibition or the drug law . 
many people feel our current laws on recreational drugs may be particularly tough and do not reduce the usage of those drugs among young people . 
instead they increase the number of young people who ultimately end up running afoul of the law . 
there are a lot of issues to be discussed and I appreciate the hon. member ' s question . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I have a little question for the member from the Conservative Party , as well as all the members from the Liberal Party . 
bill C - 3 contains very dangerous measures . 
i would like the member from the Conservative Party to tell us what he thinks about two of them : lowering the age limit of young offenders that could be submitted to adult sentences , and releasing young offenders ' names . 
Mr. Scott Brison : 
madam Speaker , I appreciate the hon. member ' s questions . 
the difficulty in the limitation of this piece of legislation is that it is justice legislation which has to deal with the problem . 
once it has gone too far preventive measures cannot be met . 
in terms of lowering the age of accountability there are some reasons this is possibly a positive measure . 
the idea is not to punish or to incarcerate 10 - year - olds . 
the fact is that in many urban settings organized crime is preying on young people and utilizing some as young as the age of 10 years to pursue crime because it realizes there is a loophole in the law by utilizing young people . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure to represent the good people of Dewdney - Alouette by entering into the debate on the topic of the youth criminal justice act , Bill C - 3 . 
i would like to start my speech today by talking a bit about the philosophical perspective that underpins this piece of legislation and many , if not all , pieces of legislation the Liberal government brings forward in this place . 
we in the official opposition have a differing philosophy which is the reason we oppose much of what is in the legislation but not all of it . 
there are some steps in the right direction . 
we must acknowledge that the Liberal government moves forward in some areas that are positive . 
we have waited for the legislation for a great deal of time . 
i believe my colleagues have been mentioning that length of time all day today as being around the 864 days the current justice minister has been justice minister and has talked about bringing in the legislation in a timely fashion . 
if this is what is called a timely fashion , I would hate to see what length of time it would take if the justice minister were taking her time on something . 
it is quite amazing it has taken this degree of time to get to this point . 
i would like to go back to the underlying philosophical perspective that seems to be apparent in much of the discussion today . 
the government talks quite a bit about offenders , their background or what may have happened to them which may have caused them to enter into an offence . 
that is a consideration that needs to be taken into account . 
that is certainly something we would take into account as well . 
the scale seems to be tipped over a bit too far in that direction . 
the current government is dealing with that rather than restoring the balance within the justice system , which is what we would seek to ask the government to address by putting forward some positive , proactive solutions that we think are missing from the legislation . 
i will touch on some of those points a bit later . 
apparently it has become important to the Liberal government to get its message out , the communication pieces out about what it is doing . 
the message may go out that the government is acting on youth justice and is firming up the law to make our streets safer . 
it seems to be most concerned about getting out that message rather than the actual tool of legislation which will make an impact at the street level on the great concerns of many Canadians in this area and many others . 
the Liberal government ' s main concern seems to be its messaging . 
if it gets the right spin , if it gets the right story out to enough people , it can garner support by saying it has addressed the youth justice issue , for example . 
i encourage Canadians to look beneath the surface of not only this piece of legislation but every piece of legislation that comes before the House to see what is their effect and direct impact on people and on the system . 
this piece of legislation fails to meet its goal in many different areas . 
that is too bad . 
the Reform Party will continue to put forward some positive proactive solutions which we hope the government picks up on . 
failing that , we will certainly work hard in every way possible to form a government to put those solutions into place . 
personal responsibility , accountability and consequences are issues that should be at the foundational level of the legislation . 
if an individual participates in an action , he or she should be held accountable for it . 
the Liberal government seems to be too quick to excuse the behaviour of people based on their age , their background , their experience or something that has happened to them . 
my party would advocate the idea of personal responsibility . 
young people should be held accountable for their actions . 
our position has been misrepresented by others in this place today . 
we are not advocating harsh treatment of young people . 
we are saying that it is harsh to ignore them , not to help them at a very young age , not to include young people in the youth justice system so they can get help and access to rehabilitative processes at a younger age . 
my colleague from Kings - Hants mentioned earlier that if we wait too long there is a group of young people that can be exploited by the fact that older individuals can seek them out to participate in illegal activities without any fear of reprisal or fear of being held accountable for the action . 
that is simply wrong and needs to be addressed but is not addressed in the legislation . 
it was mentioned in the House today that we are talking about a small number of young people that choose to participate in illegal activities . 
i agree that a small number of young people choose to participate in those kinds of activities , but they cause a great deal of damage and harm and are a concern to the public safety . 
that is a shame . 
we will continue to give the government some suggestions and solutions . 
i will talk about some things that are happening within my own community of Dewdney - Alouette . 
in the city of Maple Ridge there is an individual who is very concerned about the youth justice system . 
she is so concerned about it that many years ago she took the time to go down to the local courtroom and monitor some of the cases involving young people . 
the minister responsible for amateur sport is very interested in this discussion and I appreciate his concern . 
i hope he is taking notes . 
i would be willing to send him a copy of my speech right after I have finished . 
i know he would be willing to look at it . 
the individual in my riding is named Lola Chapman . 
that is good . 
it is one tool that can be used to address some very serious concerns about young people . 
the court diversion program developed by Ms. Chapman has become very effective . 
when individuals are referred to the program there is a quick turnaround between the time they commit the offence and the time they come before the youth justice committee . 
sometimes it is within a week if not shorter than that . 
the longest period of time may be two or three months . 
rather than having to wait for a court date a year or a year and a half away , this system works quickly and effectively . 
it has garnered a lot of praise within my own area and could certainly be used as a model throughout the country . 
it is a good program because it deals with the issue of personal accountability . 
there are key individuals within the community who sit on this panel . 
they include the mayor of one of the cities , the inspector of the RCMP , a lawyer within the community , a school principal and a member of the ministry . 
it is a good representation of key influential people within the community . 
young people have to come before the group and talk about what they did and then some suggestions are made . 
might I ask for unanimous consent to table this proactive positive solution which outlines the diversion program within my own riding of Dewdney - Alouette so all can see what great work is being done ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
adjournment PROCEEDINGS 
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved . 
bill C - 6 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , today , during question period , I asked a question to the Minister of Industry but it was answered by the Minister of Revenue , who is also responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada . 
it concerned the request made by two Quebec ministers to meet with the Minister of Industry to discuss Bill C - 6 , which will be superimposed on what already exists in Quebec for the protection of personal information . 
there is a law in Quebec that protects personal information , and the Quebec government wants to be heard by the federal government on this issue and express all the fears and objections it has concerning this bill . 
by the way , this position is not without support . 
several witnesses defended it before the committee . 
the Quebec access to information commission , the Quebec bar association , the CSN , the Chambre des notaires and the Conseil du patronat all said the same thing , that is , they are very concerned about the impact of this duplication , the problems it will create , when Quebec consumers are probably the best protected of all . 
after passage of this bill , these people will find themselves in a very muddy situation . 
some things have to be said , and the House should not be misled . 
the minister has alluded to the fact that there had been discussions between governments and that the federal government had responded to the fears and concerns of the Quebec government . 
i have here the correspondence between the Quebec government and the federal government . 
first , on November 11 , 1998 , the minister received a letter explaining why there were differences and enforcement problems . 
the minister replied . 
the Quebec government wrote another letter on January 25 . 
this time , two ministers of the Quebec government signed the letter . 
i do not have time to read it in full , but I will quote at least one part of it . 
with respect to clarity and fairness , as we were saying in our preceding letter , because of the overlap in standards and procedures that Bill C - 54 , if passed , would give rise to in Quebec , the bill is a step backward . 
it complicates the life of members of the justice system , it causes uncertainty about the rules and , thus , it penalizes both Quebec businesses and consumers . 
consequently , the minister cannot tell the House that there were satisfactory discussions with the Quebec government , that everything is fine , that we are talking to each other and harmonizing . 
there is no willingness to harmonize on the part of the federal government . 
in its brief to the federal government , the Quebec bar association , in support of the recommendation of the access to information commission , said the following : 
to avoid all confusion and make sure that Quebecers can continue to benefit from a comprehensive system of personal information protection , we submit that Bill C - 54 should be amended to say clearly that the federal act will not apply to businesses covered by the Act respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector . 
that is the Quebec act . 
the Barreau went even further . 
it added , and I quote : 
we would go further . 
to avoid confusion and legislative overlaps and duplications in Quebec , we believe that the bill should include a specific reference to the Quebec act to establish that it applies to areas of federal jurisdiction . 
we favoured the reverse approach , that is that the Quebec act should apply to all federal institutions and all federally regulated organizations . 
why does the government want to railroad the bill this week ? 
there is very serious opposition to it in Quebec and also in Ontario . 
i know that the Ontario Ministry of Health has problems with the bill . 
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
madam Speaker , Bill C - 6 will provide exemptions for private sector activities governed by the provinces , if one of them has already passed legislation essentially similar to federal legislation to protect personal information . 
the Province of Quebec has already passed legislation to protect personal information , legislation that is essentially the same as that proposed by the federal government . 
the organizations covered by the Quebec legislation will be exempted from the application of Bill C - 6 in the case of transactions taking place entirely within Quebec . 
the federal bill will add to the protection provided by the Quebec law for consumers in that province . 
these laws apply to different activities , and the federal law fills in the gaps in the coverage provided by the Quebec law . 
bill C - 6 resolves problems and situations that can simply not be covered by provincial laws , however rigorously they are drafted . 
one example might be a company with its head office in Alberta that gathers information on consumers in Quebec . 
neither of the provinces is under the authority of the other and therefore a federal scheme is required . 
once Bill C - 6 has been passed , the privacy of Quebecers will be the best protected in Canada , since they live in the only province that has enacted legislation to protect personal information in the private sector . 
as far as national security is concerned , I would like to repeat what has already been said and that is that the police and government authorities will be able to do no more and no less than they do now . 
i think Bill C - 6 is good legislation for Quebec and good legislation for Canada .

government ORDERS 
personal INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas - Charlottenburgh , Lib . ) : 
that , not later than 15 minutes before the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders this day , all questions necessary to dispose of the motion for third reading of Bill C - 6 , be deemed put and a recorded division deemed requested and deferred until Tuesday , October 26 , 1999 , at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
hon. John Manley : 
privacy is something that Canadians feel very strongly about . 
in a July 1998 Angus Reid poll 88 % of Canadians polled said that they found it unacceptable for companies and organizations to sell , trade or share lists containing personal information with other organizations . 
bill C - 6 will give Canadians the privacy protection which they desire and which they are entitled to receive . 
the bill is a legitimate exercise of the federal government ' s authority to legislate in respect of trade and commerce in Canada . 
the increasing ubiquity of networks and the speed of the technology means companies are collecting more information , circulating it more widely and combining it more ingeniously than ever before . 
that information is crossing all boundaries - provincial , territorial and national . 
provinces acting alone and even together cannot pass laws that can effectively protect information crossing those boundaries . 
a company in Alberta company collecting information from Manitobans may disclose it to another company in New Brunswick or New York . 
canada needs a federal law to protect personal data in these circumstances . 
we also need a harmonized regime - with the provinces and territories playing their part in their areas of competence . 
bill C - 6 establishes the right of all individuals to privacy in a way that is consistent with the reasonable needs of organizations to collect , use and disclose personal information . 
i would like to acknowledge at this point the excellent work of the Standing Committee on Industry . 
they have helped to make a good bill better . 
in particular , I recognize the efforts of the member for St. Catharines who served as my parliamentary secretary until August and who provided tremendous support in bringing this bill to report stage . 
amendments resulted in key areas such as the primacy of protection of privacy , protection for whistleblowers and provisions for a review of the effectiveness of the bill every five years . 
committee members always remembered that the goal is a balance product and that when you add a bit to one side of the scale you must also keep the other side in mind , to ensure that equilibrium is maintained . 
we are all aware that the legislative process can be both and complicated . 
but again , the process of public hearings and debate has resulted in a superior outcome . 
i would like to highlight briefly what some key witnesses told the Standing Committee on Industry during its hearings on the personal information protection and electronic documents bill . 
consumers and privacy advocates supported the bill and expressed a desire to see it passed now , even if not all of their requested changes were made . 
however , the federal privacy commissioner himself stated quite eloquently that he did not want binding powers and that the most elegant and least cumbersome way to achieve the desired results would be through a proactive approach based on education and ombudsman - like powers . 
in the end , the validity of the privacy commissioner ' s arguments was recognized and prevailed . 
when it was the business community ' s turn to address Bill C - 6 many stressed their support for the legislation and appreciation for its basis in the CSA standard . 
the view was expressed that the smooth harmonization of privacy frameworks across the country is highly desirable . 
businesses and consumers alike told the industry committee that they also welcomed parts 2 to 5 of the bill , which will permit the government to deliver services to its citizens electronically and permit the government and the courts to use and accept electronic documents and signatures . 
the business community needs the continued ability to gather information to detect fraud and the violation of agreements . 
this ability is important to sectors as diverse as the computer software and insurance industries . 
the intent of Bill C - 6 is to strike a delicate balance between these entirely legitimate needs and consumers ' equally valid expectations for privacy protection . 
amendments aimed at helping businesses combat fraud were carefully designed to maintain that balance . 
the commissioners were very strong in their support for public education and held that its value in changing the landscape of privacy protection is great . 
the Ontario commissioner emphasized this point . 
she stated that public education changes practices for the better and reduces complaints . 
topics such as harmonization and duplication of regulation received thoughtful consideration . 
the Quebec commissioner made suggestions for avoiding areas of potential confusion , while other commissioners held that the bill could be passed first and appropriate administrative arrangements worked out afterward among commissioners . 
the bill ' s structure was also a focus of comment . 
the B.C. commissioner dismissed any criticism that the bill might be awkward to read as some had argued . 
he stated that many laws , even consumer protection laws , were written in complex language and expressed his confidence that Canada ' s privacy commissioners would be competent enough to interpret and implement Bill C - 6 . 
ever mindful of the need to continuously improve on the bill , we introduced amendments after the industry committee ' s report to the House . 
we improved the primacy clause and required confidential measures in federal court hearings . 
we have amended clause 30 to clarify how the bill applies in its first three years . 
and we have made changes to ensure that law enforcement bodies can continue to carry out their mandate as they currently do . 
these law enforcement amendments clarify for organizations the circumstances under which they may accede to the lawful requests of government institutions for personal information for national security for enforcement or administration purposes . 
these amendments allow the status quo to continue and allow businesses to continue to co - operate , where appropriate . 
these amendments do not grant new powers to government institutions , nor do they create new obligations on business . 
the intent of the bill is to regulate the commercial use of personal information . 
for instance , in the case of the publicly funded health care system , the bill is not intended to impede the flow of information necessary for the protection of patients ' health and the improvement of the administration of health care . 
to clarify this , I tabled an amendment on October 15 which specifically addresses the need to share information without consent when it is necessary for the administration of a law or program . 
the information highway offers opportunities to improve the efficacy and indeed accountability of our health care system . 
organizations such as the Canadian Institute for Health Information assists in this endeavour . 
bill C - 6 is intended to facilitate these initiatives as it provides a basic set of fair information practices around which all stakeholders can harmonize . 
in the pursuit of a harmonized privacy protection regime for Canada , we encourage all the provinces and the territories to move swiftly to legislate broadly in their own jurisdictions . 
in closing , a brief overview of what the personal information protection and electronic documents act will accomplish will reveal how the government has addressed the concerns of witnesses who appeared before the committee . 
the overarching goal of Bill C - 6 is to codify a right to privacy without placing a heavy burden on business , intruding unduly on the right of freedom of expression or destroying our historical memory by interfering with the preservation of documents . 
bill C - 6 will foster responsible privacy practices . 
oversight will be complaints driven , but the Privacy Commissioner has been given a strong public education and advisory role . 
the commissioner will be able to help businesses comply with the law , launch investigations , compel witnesses and evidence and conduct audits where he has a reasonable cause to think that something might be happening that is contrary to the law . 
bill C - 6 will establish harmonized national rules to avoid different sets of rules for business and the resulting confusion for citizens . 
the provisions will also encourage provincial and territorial action to legislate . 
only Quebec has its own privacy law in place . 
British Columbia is working on one , and with the strong federal leadership that the bill represents , we expect others will soon follow . 
canada is unique in the world for having developed a national standard to protect privacy . 
considerable momentum already exists in the application of the CSA code in the marketplace . 
a number of industry associates and firms have CSA based codes . 
it makes sense to build on that consensus and momentum and that is what Bill C - 6 has done . 
internationally , the adoption of Bill C - 6 will show the way to the future . 
the use of standards is an accepted way to resolve trade disputes over differing national rules and Canada will continue to support the movement toward an international privacy standard . 
Canadians need and they want privacy protection . 
the right of Canadians to control their personal data is within their reach with the bill . 
the bill before the House is a product of informed review by many experts in the field of data protection and electronic commerce , of widespread public consultations and of an extensive examination by members of the House . 
it is a good bill . 
in releasing his annual report earlier this week , Mr. Bruce Phillips , Canada ' s Privacy Commissioner , said this : 
the bill represents considerable ingenuity and not a little courage . 
if we fiddle in the face of lobbying and jurisdictional disputes , Canadians ' privacy and the business opportunities on - line will burn . 
i urge all members of the House to support passage of Bill C - 6 , to support the right of Canadian citizens to protect their own personal , private information . 
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , Bill C - 6 , which is the old Bill C - 54 from the last session of parliament , is a bill largely about the future . 
the government is trying to catch up with technology to regulate for reasonable order and safety , much like governments did as they tried to keep up with the emergence of the motor car , airplane , travel , telephones , radio broadcasting , television and now a universe of information transfer and monitoring never imagined by the writers of our constitution passed in 1867 . 
form continues to follow function and I am sure that the present bill will be subject to much amendment in future years as society attempts to respond to issues of sovereignty , rights , protection and general order . 
maybe it could be said that Alvin Toffler was right that social change accelerates and we all struggle to deal with future shock , even governments . 
part 1 of the bill establishes a right to the protection of personal information used in commercial activities in connection with the operation of a federal work , undertaking , or business or interprovincially or internationally . 
it establishes principles to govern the collection , the use and disclosure of personal information . 
it deals with accountability , identifying the purposes for the collection of personal information , obtaining consent , limiting collection , limiting use , disclosure and retention , ensuring accuracy , providing adequate security , making information management policies readily available , providing individuals with access to information about themselves and giving individuals a right to challenge an organization ' s compliance with these principles . 
it further provides for the privacy commissioner to receive complaints concerning contraventions of the principles , conduct investigations and attempt to resolve such complaints . 
unresolved disputes relating to certain matters can also be taken to the federal court for resolution . 
part 2 sets out a scheme by which requirements in federal statutes and regulations that assume the use of paper do not necessarily expressly permit the use of electronic technology , may be administered or complied with in the electronic environment . 
the bill grants authority to make regulations about how these requirements may be satisfied by using electronic means . 
part 2 also describes the characteristics of secure electronic signatures and grants authority to make regulations prescribing technologies for the purpose of the definition of " secure electronic signature '' . 
part 3 amends the Canada Evidence Act to ease the admissibility of electronic documents , to establish evidentiary presumptions related to secure electronic signatures and to provide for the recognition as evidence of notices , acts or other documents published electronically by the Queen ' s Printer . 
part 4 amends the Statutory Instruments Act to authorize the publication of the Canada Gazette by electronic means , which will certainly be thanked by many . 
part 5 amends the Statute Revision Act to authorize the publication and distribution of an electronic version of the consolidated statutes and regulations of Canada . 
this is a democratizing barrier removal for all citizens . 
we have been at the Canadian democratic experiment at least since 1867 , 132 years or more , with our evolution to responsible and accountable government from dependent colonialism . 
i am here in parliament as a Reformer in part because it is too evident that we still have a lot of work to do on that score to take up the job of expanding the boundary of democracy , of implementing needed change . 
sadly it is a quest that the old reformers forsook , those who became the true Grits , for the Liberals who have long forgotten about being the repressed underdog in governance , for they are now so smugly superior , secretly plotting to avoid real public political accountability . 
it is an ideological gap that I am talking about . 
with Bill C - 6 they are playing catch - up . 
as in commerce , Canada has a long way to catch up politically , even reforming this very parliament . 
canada started with a constitution that was rooted in certain basic principles and was written by some incredibly brilliant people who understood that times would change , the definitions of fundamental things of governance would change and that circumstances would require people to rise to the challenges of each new era by applying old values in practical ways . 
it is recognized that as Canada changed from being an agricultural to an industrial society that the laws made under simpler conditions of living could not handle the complex relations of the modern industrial world , and now even the cyber age . 
while the bill attempts to deal with some technological matters that have gone way ahead of governance , Reformers also work for the day when we can bring this creaky institution of parliament into the cyber age of political accountability , using technology to more fully obtain political consent from an informed electorate who watches , engages and decides , often through electronic means . 
it is present day Reformers that seek to move the boundaries between old and new . 
we might even get TV cameras in the Senate some day and have more committees televised . 
parliament needs to get fully plugged in , turned on and really connected to the people it is supposed to serve . 
reformers of old , it must be remembered , fought hard to adapt our institutions to new realities , to update vital protections for our citizens , to expand the developing notions of the right to privacy which has become most valued by our present culture . 
we are in the midst of another vast social transformation . 
once again the law needs to govern fluid markets , documentation and legal exchange . 
they are so dynamic they could not have been imagined in the British North America Act of 1867 when it enumerated responsibilities . 
once again we have to respond , applying our oldest values and practical ways that allow them to be preserved and enhanced in modern times . 
we all know that technology and competition have revolutionized the financial services industry . 
i think most of us believe that by and large these changes have been very good . 
but many people do not have the knowledge to properly evaluate what is truly a dizzying array of options . 
that is why we have to deal with these things in parliament , to give all Canadians both the tools and the confidence they need to fully participate in the thriving but highly complex 21 st century economy that will often be focused in the world of electronic commerce . 
the term electronic commerce refers generally to commercial transactions , involving both organizations and individuals , that are based upon the processing and transmission of digitized data , including text , sound and visual images , and that are carried out over open networks . 
although much media attention is focused on online merchants selling books , wine and computers , the vast majority of products marketed electronically business to consumer are intangibles such as travel and ticketing services , software entertainment such as online games , music and gambling , as well as banking , insurance and brokerage services , information services , legal services , real estate services and increasingly health care , education and government services . 
in view of these realities there are some principles that must be regarded . 
the technological revolution now makes it easier than ever before for people to dig into and collect our private financial data for their own profit . 
some private financial information is protected under existing federal law . 
one ' s banker , broker or insurance company could still share with affiliated firms information of what one buys with cheques and credit cards or sell this information to the highest bidder . 
we need better laws to give Canadians the right to control their financial information , to let the consumer decide whether they want to share private information with anyone else . 
they need to know where it goes and why . 
to enhance financial privacy we must also protect the sanctity of medical records . 
with a growing number of mergers between companies , financial institutions and lenders potentially can gain access to the private medical information contained in insurance forms or from government subcontractors . 
we need to severely restrict the sharing of medical information . 
people should not have to worry that the results of their latest medical physical exam will be used to deny them a home mortgage or a credit card . 
the possibilities must be carefully anticipated for protection . 
it should be understood that our basic privacy is at stake . 
as electronic commerce develops , the volume and the nature of personal data such as name , address , interests and records of all purchases can be disclosed on networks during electronic activities and these transactions certainly will increase . 
new methods for processing the vast accumulation of data such as data mining allow the creation of customer profiles that combine demographic data , credit information , usage patterns and minute details of transactions . 
if consumers do not have control over the collection and use of their personal data , electronic commerce must facilitate the invasion of their privacy . 
but if consumers are in a position to either decline or to give informed consent to the collection and use of their personal data , electronic commerce will not be too much different from traditional commerce . 
in today ' s world , consumers may participate in what we call fidelity or loyal shopping plans , or choose to exchange their privacy for something they value such as lower prices , convenience or personalization . 
businesses and consumers will have to help adjudicate the tradeoff between protecting privacy and obtaining the benefits of electronic commerce that both value . 
education on this issue is therefore of primary importance . 
the question has come up about illegal and harmful content . 
there has been much public concern about the content of some of the information distributed and accessed on the Internet . 
disagreeable or detrimental content is not more prevalent on the Internet than beneficial content , but the people who distribute and access disagreeable or detrimental material on the Internet enjoy the same advantages offered by the Internet as others do . 
the positive elements are vast in terms of opportunities for electronic commerce , community development , communication and access to information . 
the reality is that with those benefits come the difficulties of coping with content judged to be detrimental . 
the development of electronic commerce could potentially be impeded by illegal and harmful content issues where users fear unwanted content and where network service providers fear the liability they will take on if they are expected to be responsible for the content that flows across their systems . 
although traditional methods for addressing these issues may not be as feasible in the electronic environment , advances in technology are offering new ways to resolve some of these issues . 
we must require greater public disclosure and enhance every consumer ' s right to know . 
consumers received millions of credit card solicitations last year . 
some offers contained new traps for the unwary . 
for example , sometimes credit card companies advertise low interest rates known as teaser rates to reel in consumers who are then surprised with unexpected interest rate hikes . 
millions of consumers have also found out the hard way that making only minimum payments rarely helps retire debt and almost always results in very large interest payments . 
we should require clear notice of how long and how costly repayments would be if the consumer makes only the minimum payment . 
we have to do more to combat consumer fraud . 
it is remarkably easy now for a thief to take out huge loans in someone else ' s name , run up enormous credit card debts and tap into bank accounts . 
we have now heard at least twice this year in the Commons that the RCMP do not have the basic resources to attack consumer commercial fraud . 
consequently capacity creates its own demand and it will only flourish if the government is not minding the people ' s business . 
we need to give priority to cases involving identity theft , particularly those involving organized crime groups with the goal of increasing the number of prosecutions . 
it must be made harder to steal someone else ' s identity in the first place . 
telephone long distance fraud is also rampant and the millions lost is reflected on my telephone bill . 
we also need to crack down on fraud committed over the Internet . 
if we want to seize the Internet ' s full potential , we have to stay ahead of those who would use this open medium to manipulate stock prices , commit fraud on online auctions or perpetuate any other type of financial scam . 
we need a national co - ordinated approach for tracking Internet fraud and to train those in provincial and federal law enforcement how to recognize and root out these schemes . 
it could be said that the law enforcement community compared to people who are doing criminal activity are like unaware parents trying to keep up with their children who go on the computer . 
it is an endless effort . 
investors need better information to protect themselves against online securities fraud . 
complaints of Internet fraud are greatly increasing , for every new medium of exchange brings a new opportunity for criminal exploitation . 
are the Liberals on top of it ? 
i doubt it , for they have shown time and again that they are not really wise managers of the public trust . 
we must provide services for those who have been denied access to the wired world and ensure opportunities for all . 
technology can bring , for example , credit and banking services to the disenfranchised . 
we need to continue to expand the bounds of service for the aged and the challenged with low fee bank accounts and services in ways that maximize the possibility of technology yet preserve safety and accountability . 
electronic commerce dramatically reduces the economic distance between producers and consumers . 
consumers can make their purchases directly without involving traditional retailers , wholesalers and in some cases distributors . 
they benefit from improved information , lower transaction costs and thus lower prices , and larger choices which can include products tailored to individual requirements and instant delivery for intangible services and products in digital form . 
for sellers , electronic commerce also presents many advantages . 
small scale manufacturers can gain access to a global marketplace with relative ease . 
specialist resellers enjoy the same advantage . 
neither need maintain a physical store or shop and inventory can be managed more efficiently . 
labour cost savings can be considerable . 
for instance , one estimate places the cost of buying software on the Internet at 20 cents to 50 cents per transaction as opposed to $ 5 for a telephone order and $ 15 our a traditional retailer . 
but just as electronic commerce offers new market opportunities , it will also intensify competition . 
it will probably make some provisions of provincial labour codes obsolete . 
government must strive to provide the opportunity for everyone to have access to electronic commerce . 
the key difference in having rights and benefiting from them is the degree of participation and full exchange . 
anyone with access to the Internet has access to electronic commerce . 
online commerce requires hardware such as computers and servers , software , and the ability to connect to the network itself which may involve access to telephone , cable TV , cellular mobile networks , satellites or broadcasting networks . 
equipment costs , access charges and the complexity of the evolving Internet itself are barriers to universal Internet access . 
at present , regulatory structures in many countries still limit market access by infrastructure providers . 
this is changing with the liberalization of telecommunications . 
estimates of the number of Internet users vary between 30 million and 50 million . 
it is a rapidly growing population . 
just three or four years ago the number of users was only in the thousands . 
the number of commercial transactions made over the Internet is also rapidly growing . 
nearly all analysts predict growth by factors of 10 or more and that electronic commerce will overtake the size of mail catalogue sales in the United States alone . 
the networks are being built but they will likely never be comprehensive or fast enough for changing demands . 
sadly , the law , protections and regulatory climate will always be behind , especially if the Liberals stay in power in Canada . 
at present most customers connect to communications networks via a standard telephone line . 
local telephone tariffs currently account for more than 60 % of the cost of Internet access . 
the expansion of electronic commerce depends on speeding up data transmission while keeping the costs very low . 
increasing competition in the communications market is the best way to encourage network upgrading . 
one key to increasing competition is to put in place regulatory structures that encourage the creation of networks providing and supporting all types of applications , including entertainment , voice telephony and electronic commerce . 
however , it seems that we will always have one hand tied behind our backs in this country , because we have a Canadian policy for Luddites who vainly resist in the name of Canadian content which seems premised upon a cultural inferiority complex . 
our law must properly follow the opportunities of technology for jobs , growth and trade . 
by raising economic efficiency , electronic commerce will increase overall wealth . 
in doing so , it will impose adjustments on existing economic structures , for electronic commerce may well result in the loss of employment in traditional distribution and retailing . 
however , experience demonstrates that technological change will create new and better replacement jobs . 
electronic commerce is already creating new high quality computing and communications jobs linked to the development of global digital markets . 
of course the NDP will rail against it and claim it needs an even more iron fisted union to stop the sun from rising , the light of new knowledge coming in , or it will want a world ruler of the Tobin tax to mitigate against what it cannot comprehend . 
outdated political ideologies hurt people , stunt potential , breed poverty and perpetuate oppression and servitude . 
that is what the NDP ideology must be understood to bring , in light of discussing the implications of Bill C - 6 and the future . 
from the perspective of the firm , the cost of doing business on new electronic networks is significantly lower than the cost of traditional methods . 
this advantage plus the ability to offer high value , content rich products and services has led to exponential growth in the number of firms entering electronic commerce and related businesses . 
this is most evident in the urban North American centres but is becoming evident in other countries as well . 
by bringing buyers and sellers closer together , electronic commerce will facilitate trade growth . 
Canadian wealth is based on international trade , but there is no help from the NDP anti - traders belief system . 
what we are talking about also has consequences for taxation and tariffs . 
jurisdictional rules applying to taxes and tariffs are generally based on concepts of physical geography , such as place of supply or residence of a taxpayer . 
as electronic commerce is not bound by physical geography , it may become difficult for taxpayers and governments to determine jurisdiction and revenue rights . 
for consumption taxes , there may be a need for action to avoid double or non - taxation . 
the availability , reliability and completeness of commercial records generated in an electronic commercial environment , including those from electronic payment systems , are also of concern . 
such records must be relied upon to ensure that taxation and tariffs have been appropriately and fairly applied . 
many forms of taxation and tariffs are levelled on physical goods . 
the ability in electronic commerce to create electronic substitutes like electronic books presents challenges for revenue collection and the archaic quota regimes overseen by our heritage minister . 
the existence of electronic products also raises issues of fairness between taxes and tariffs imposed on physical goods and electronic substitutes . 
the ability within the electronic distribution channels to bypass any or all of these traditional middlemen between producer and consumer raises serious issues for the collection of taxes , particularly withholding taxes . 
the use of electronic commerce technologies in the form of intranets by multinationals and collaborative groups may tend to increase the prevalence of transfer pricing and increase the difficulty of detecting such behaviour . 
the predicted growth of international electronic commerce , much of which may be undertaken by smaller less sophisticated businesses , may mean the number of unintentional breaches of international revenue laws could increase . 
given the global nature of electronic commerce , it is important that the decisions taken by government continue to allow for the international flow of data . 
moreover , technological tools will offer new ways to allow users to protect themselves . 
some of them are mechanisms for verifying information such as labelling systems which certify that an online business meets certain good standards of business . 
other mechanisms exist for notifying consumers of legal jurisdiction or venue for resolving disputes arising from a transaction . 
some others allow consumers to access educational messages that describe their rights in the context of electronic transactions . 
canada certainly needs to work with the international community to provide a forum for continuing exchange of views on developing technologies and an institutional framework to support them . 
we also have to increase the financial and electronic literacy of the Canadian people . 
it is not enough to know how to balance a chequebook any more . 
even those fortunate to have the help of accountants sometimes have a hard time understanding all the ins and outs of investing in an RSP , paying off credit card debt or refinancing a mortgage . 
knowledge is power and as Canadians understand technology they will use it in ways that make it accountable to them , as it enhances their quality of life . 
laws and regulations must go hand in hand with an informed public if technology is to serve us rather than us serving it . 
as reported in the Ottawa Citizen today , Ontario residents may soon have a single computerized card that will do everything from providing access to health care to serving as a driver ' s licence under a new project unveiled by the province . 
the smart card concept announced in the provincial government ' s throne speech yesterday , it is hoped , will mean more convenience for the public and less fraud . 
the term usually refers to a credit card with a tiny computer chip that contains lots of information about the cardholder that can replace the need for many cards . 
the one card will include a driver ' s licence , access to services such as medicare , social assistance and senior benefits . 
the future is here . 
how far off will it be that a ton of information that can be put on one small card will simply be put on a microscopic chip under the skin on one ' s hand ? 
by then the universal numbers will be assigned at birth , which can be the international drawing rights credit card , citizenship and right to vote registration for the world , and contain personal international telephone and computer access numbers . 
the technology seems to be coming , but are the law and society ready for these realities ? 
that is what we are trying to do with Bill C - 6 . 
it is an attempt to improve privacy , enhance disclosure , combat fraud , increase access and bring the transactional world of commerce and law under some semblance of control . 
members of the official opposition engaged fully in the process of the bill . 
reform recognizes the fine line between the right of Canadians to have freedom of speech and the right of privacy . 
the need for that balance has become acute as Canadians embrace new technologies . 
therefore we support the regulation that Bill C - 6 introduces . 
in conclusion , the objectives of the bill are broadly similar to the ones used to harness the opportunities and benefits of the industrial revolution . 
they are just as vital today , if not more so , as they were a century ago . 
it is now time to use them to seize the enormous potential of the information revolution for every Canadian citizen . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , here we are at third reading of Bill C - 6 , formerly Bill C - 54 , whereby the federal government intends , as far as we are concerned in Quebec , to become king and master of what the protection of personal information should be . 
in spite of all the attempts on the part of the Bloc Quebecois and all those who came before the parliamentary committee to show how bad this bill would be for Quebec , we are not debating it at third reading . 
before going any further , I want to salute the excellent job done by my colleague from Mercier who single - handedly carried this matter for a year to bring government members to realize the impact this bill would have in Quebec and how flawed it is even for those Canadians it purports to protect . 
we could talk about the real efficiency of this bill which is more about promoting electronic commerce than protecting personal information . 
this week , the government decided to ram through this bill by the end of business today and to defer the division at third reading until the beginning of next week . 
the bill contains some amendments coming from the government . 
it is important to know that , half way through , the government saw the holes in its bills and started improvizing , trying to improve certain areas , tabling amendments of its own after witnesses were heard in committee . 
thus , the government , realizing its bill was flawed , brought in new amendments , but did not allow any debate on them to give people a chance to be heard . 
groups who appeared before the committee never saw them , which creates a very dangerous situation . 
strangely enough , some of the last - minute amendments exempt the government from the application of its own act in a number of cases . 
is it not strange that the government should come to this realization only after the committee hearing stage , and that it thought appropriate to give itself and its components some manoeuvering room in order not to abide by its own law ? 
this is a bit surprising coming from a government that says it wants to protect people but is looking for ways to avoid doing so itself whenever possible . 
this act serves as a model , because there are very few others like it ; in fact , it is the only one of its kind in North America . 
now the federal government has decided to take a page from our book . 
it is a desirable thing that all Canadians be protected with respect to the distribution of their personal information . 
but , seeing how slow the other provinces have been to act , the federal government decided to introduce legislation . 
i would point out , however , that the provinces , in conjunction with the federal government , had already embarked on a process of harmonizing legislation . 
but , last year , the federal government decided unilaterally to withdraw from the process and come up with its own legislation . 
it withdrew from the joint effort it had embarked on with the provinces , an exercise in which Quebec had pointed out that it had its own legislation . 
by the way , there are two relevant instruments in Quebec : the act , and the Civil Code , which also governs the protection of personal information . 
if memory serves , the applicable articles of the Civil Code are 35 to 40 . 
the act is thoroughly steeped in Quebec ' s civil law tradition , as opposed to the common law tradition on which the federal government ' s approach is based . 
enforcement will be extremely difficult . 
it is no accident that the Barreau du Qu é bec , the Chambre des notaires , the Conseil du patronat , and a union body such as the CSN told the government that what it was proposing for Quebec was ridiculous , that it would be unworkable and complicated for businesses , a complete disaster . 
there was legislation protecting personal information and not focussed on encouraging e - commerce . 
e - commerce will grow despite the federal government . 
it does not need any legislation to encourage it . 
it is developing at a phenomenal rate and will continue to do so . 
what is needed is assurance of the protection of distribution , disclosure and transmission of personal information . 
i will give hon. members an example of the very fuzzy concepts its contains . 
in the Government of Quebec ' s legislation , the consent for release of specific information must be very clear . 
the individual must have consented to the transfer of his personal information . 
at the federal level , the approach is far more vague , so things are not as clear . 
explicit consent is not necessarily required . 
once again , it can be seen that the two governments are guided by two very different mindsets . 
i will continue by quoting from the testimony of some of those who appeared before the committee . 
in fact , I intend to quote two . 
when I was preparing my speech for this morning , a comment I heard came to mind . 
a man spoke of his fear that the organizations with the greatest interest in invading our privacy were the ones setting the legislative agenda . 
he said " Now it is clear that Bill C - 54 '' - now Bill C - 6 - `` is an initiative on e - commerce . 
i believe it is useful to note that the words ` consumers ' , ` businesses ' , and ` industry ' appear 78 times , while ` citizen ' appears only ten times '' . 
so said Valerie Steve , a professor at the human rights research and education centre . 
this then is a very different approach from what the government was boasting about this morning , saying that it wants is simply to protect personal information . 
i will now quote from the remarks made by the former president of the Quebec bar association , who also has interesting things to say . 
he said " From a very careful reading of Bill C - 54 , in my opinion , this would mean a significant step backwards for Quebec '' . 
i repeat " in my own opinion , this would mean a very significant step backwards for Quebec '' . 
he added " These regulations , in fact , this sort of voluntary standard , are given the status of law by making them a schedule . 
they are not stringent enough to protect consumers . 
they are full of loopholes for commerce . 
it is based in large part on a completely outmoded approach to consumer protection with virtually non existent rights of recourse '' . 
i will return to the notion of recourse for consumers . 
i want to ask for unanimous consent to have my speaking time of 40 minutes split into two 20 minute periods , since I will be sharing my time with the member for Mercier . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent to permit the hon. member to share his time in two 20 minute periods ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed .

DOUKHOBOR RUSSIANS 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in 1899 many Doukhobor Russians immigrated to Canada to escape persecution due to their pacifist beliefs . 
a great many of those people have settled in what is now the riding of Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan . 
over the years the Doukhobor people have integrated into Canadian society , but while doing so have still retained their language , culture , religion and traditions . 
they amply demonstrate that there is more to be gained through unity than division . 
this weekend many of them are gathered here in Ottawa at a conference celebrating their first hundred years in Canada . 
i am sure that all members of the House will join me in welcoming the Doukhobors and offering congratulations on the contribution they make to Canadian society .

potato INDUSTRY 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last June 18 I had the opportunity along with the premier of P.E.I. to open the P.E.I. Potato Board Quality Monitoring and Inspection Station . 
this facility has the capability to inspect the quality of all loads of potatoes leaving the province by truck . 
the building was dedicated to the memory of the late Gordon Dawson , a potato producer who was a leader in the industry in growing and promoting quality spuds . 
a plaque unveiled states : " The P.E.I. potato industry dedicates this facility to the memory of Gordon A . Dawson , Augustine Cove , P.E.I. , a potato grower and shipper who firmly believed that growing and marketing the highest quality product is the foundation of Prince Edward Island ' s strength in potato markets around the world '' . 
Mr. Dawson and his family exemplified what potato quality is all about . 
his legacy will continue through this new facility and as a result growers , shippers and consumers will benefit .

Mr. John Richardson ( Perth - Middlesex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this year CJCS , Stratford ' s first and still operating radio station , is celebrating its 75 th anniversary . 
attaining an amateur broadcasting permit in 1923 , the station was named C 3 GG and was originally situated at 151 Ontario Street . 
owned at one time by Jack Kent Cooke and Lord Thompson of Fleet , the station has had a few well known announcers from the broadcasting field start out at CJCS . 
these include LLoyd Robertson , John Thretheway and Frank P . Stalley . 
i wish to congratulate the present station owners , Steve and Carolyn Rae , on all their success and wish them a further 75 years of quality live broadcasting .

agriculture 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , many farmers across the country are going broke or are having a difficult time making ends meet . 
for most it is through no fault of their own . 
farmers are paying the price for this government letting them down in trade talks , for this government overtaxing them everywhere they turn and through everything they buy , for this government imposing unfair user fees on them and for this government burdening our farmers with unnecessary red tape and over regulation . 
for six years Reform has fought for the government to lower taxes , to remove unfair user fees , to reduce red tape and to get tough on trade talks . 
for the past 10 years Reform has proposed compensating farmers through a trade distortion adjustment program for losses resulting from unfair trade practices on the part of Europe , the United States , Asia and elsewhere .

Mr. Larry McCormick ( Hastings - Frontenac - Lennox and Addington , Lib . ) : 
hosted by the Southeastern Ontario District Health Council as a part of its larger Children ' s Wellness Initiative , it attracted participants from the fields of education , employment , recreation , economics , social services , justice , health and government . 
keynote speakers included renowned medical researcher and early childhood development expert , Dr. Fraser Mustard ; Dr. John Wootton , Executive Director of the Office of Rural Health for Health Canada ; and our eminent colleague and children ' s issues advocate , the hon. member for Don Valley West . 
if we want the brightest future possible for our country , we must ensure that all of our children have the best possible start in life '' .

national CO - OP WEEK 
Mr. Paul Mercier ( Terrebonne - Blainville , BQ ) : 
in this era of globalization , at a time when major corporations are streamlining their operations strictly for reasons of profits , co - operatives are viewed as an effective protection against desolidarization within the economy . 
throughout the world , an increasing number of men and women are turning to co - ops as a mean to reconcile economic development and solidarity . 
co - ops inform and develop , while promoting democracy and solidarity . 
long live the co - ops .

Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Ezra Levant of Reform question period fame is a man of many words and unbridled optimism . 
after a date last year in Toronto he was told his chances of a repeat encounter were a daunting one in a million . 
Ezra ' s response ? 
" yes , I have a chance . 
i have a shot '' . 
five hundred roses and countless trips to Toronto later , Ezra got lucky . 
at 5 p.m. on Sunday , October 24 at Shaarei Tefillah Synagogue in Toronto , Ezra Levant and Golda Van Messel are to be joined in marriage . 
life in Toronto has changed Ezra a bit . 
he no longer snacks on steaks or chews on members of the Upper House . 
he now enjoys sushi and spends quiet afternoons doing arts and crafts . 
i invite this House to join the official opposition in wishing both Ezra and Golda all the very best in their new life together .

sudden INFANT DEATH SYNDROME MONTH 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi è re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is with sadness that I must remind the House and all Canadians that October is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Month . 
sudden infant death syndrome , also known as crib death , refers to the sudden and unexplainable death of an apparently healthy baby , usually under the age of one . 
every week , three babies die of SIDS , leaving families grieving their tragic loss . 
the Canadian Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths is conducting research to determine what causes crib death . 
the foundation , along with Health Canada and a number of other organizations , is striving to develop public awareness and to inform people , so as to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome . 
i am asking you to join me in wishing the Canadian Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths and its countless volunteers a resounding success during Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Month .

Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in this Year of the Francophonie , I would like to pay tribute to the vital role played by mothers and school teachers in the fight for the survival of the francophone community in Manitoba . 
although the rights of francophones were enshrined in Manitoba ' s Constitution in 1916 , the provincial government prohibited the teaching of French until 1947 . 
the official story glosses over the role of women , but it is important that young people know that their grandmothers and great - grandmothers were active in helping the francophone community in Manitoba survive . 
for over 30 years , these women ensured the survival of their franco - Manitoban cultural heritage by educating children in French . 
today , because of their efforts , over 22,000 Manitobans live in French .

grain 
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , 82 % of Saskatchewan farmers support continued regulation of freight rates and 63 % want the wheat board to keep its role in the grain transportation system . 
however , the Liberals are pressing ahead with their crazy plan to deregulate the rail transportation system . 
deregulation has been a colossal disaster for the airline industry , but deregulation in the grain transportation sector is even worse . 
freight rate costs to farmers have tripled since the Liberals cancelled railway cost reviews and killed the Crow benefit , while rail service to branch lines was cut back . 
the result , railway profits have doubled and thousands of farmers are going bankrupt from skyrocketing input costs , record low grain prices and cruel Liberal policies .

peacekeeping DAY 
Mr. Ren é Laurin ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if world peace is to be maintained , the laws governing relations between nations must be enforced and respected . 
faithful to our tradition as peacekeepers , we support the peaceful resolution through peacekeeping missions of the conflicts in which many nations are embroiled . 
Saturday , October 23 , is Peacekeeping Day , a day to pay tribute to Canada ' s participation in various peacekeeping missions throughout the world . 
this October 23 , let us remember the devotion of the men and women who have served the cause of democracy by taking part in these missions . 
their contribution has been instrumental in maintaining international peace and security . 
peacekeeping Day provides an opportunity to officially recognize that contribution . 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I wish to pay them a well - deserved tribute and to tell them how greatly we admire them .

crime PREVENTION 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on October 6 , the federal government announced allocation of $ 557,165 to assist in the funding of 15 crime prevention projects in Quebec . 
the National Strategy for Community Safety and Crime Prevention helps communities to develop community solutions to problems linked to crime and victimization and to enhance the awareness of all communities involved in the fight against crime . 
there is much still to be done . 
let us hope that everyone directly or indirectly involved in crime prevention will participate actively in this type of program , the existence of which was made possible by the federal government . 
essentially , the purpose of this initiative by the Liberal government is to enhance the quality of life of Canadians , and this requires enhanced security .

child PORNOGRAPHY 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , at the present time the people of this country are greatly concerned about their children ' s safety , having learned that the Supreme Court will not be hearing the case on child pornography until January 18 , 2000 . 
the Minister of Justice tells us children are at no risk whatsoever , while the families await a decision from the nine federal justices . 
given their case load , the final decision by these judges might come only in 2001 . 
if her department had referred this case immediately to the Supreme Court last winter , the public would be less concerned . 
according to her , all our children are still protected nevertheless . 
can she guarantee that the message these recent decisions are sending to predators is not encouraging them to continue their despicable behaviour ? 
can she prove to us that the lawyers of these predators are not using the recent court decisions as legal loopholes ? 
we trust that the minister will not wait for some other dramatic event to make the news before she does something .

peacekeeping 
Mrs. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) : 
today more than 4,000 Canadian forces personnel are far from their loved ones , unselfishly giving their best to missions in far away places such as the Golan Heights , Cypress , the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait , Kosovo and Bosnia - Herzegovina . 
our men and women are also contributing to other complex and sometimes dangerous peace support operations in East Timor , the Arabian gulf , Cambodia , Guatemala and Mozambique . 
to commemorate United Nations Day and the 11 th anniversary of the Nobel Peace Prize for peacekeeping , the Canadian forces will at 10 a.m. on Saturday , October 23 , 1999 hold a ceremony at the peacekeeping monument in Ottawa to pay tribute to the men and women of the Canadian forces who have died while serving on peacekeeping missions around the globe . 
i know that all members of the House will join me in honouring both the sacrifices and continuing exemplary commitment of the men and women of the Canadian forces .

pay EQUITY 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals need to stop saying one thing when they mean another . 
take the notion of pay equity . 
Canadians want anyone doing the same job to be paid the same . 
to them the state should decide what your job is worth and which job should be paid the same as other jobs . 
how does the state make this leap of logic ? 
the Liberals cannot really say . 
but naturally they know better than workers , unions and employers what jobs are worth , and once that dollar figure has been pulled out of the Liberal hat , someone has to pay a lot of money , unless that someone is a Liberal . 
they fight for years not to have to pay the price of their own foolishness . 
equity means fairness and equal treatment . 
only the Liberals could undermine this fine principle by using it to cloak arbitrary state intervention . 
Canadians beware , fairness can become what the government says is fair not what citizens agree is fair in free negotiations . 
is that the - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Dartmouth .

YWCA 
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) : 
as the member of parliament for Dartmouth , I know where much of the violence in my community comes from . 
it is from poverty , from hopelessness and from an sense of deep frustration of being left out of the good things which the country has to offer . 
it comes from running up against brick walls as people look for jobs , decent housing , pensions , as they stand in line at food banks . 
it comes from seeing government policies that do not address these issues but instead continue to maintain high levels of poverty , unemployment and economic barriers to higher education . 
as we applaud the YWCA for its efforts to draw attention to violence , let us here in the House collectively address the roots of poverty with progress and with humane policies that put people first , children first and equity first . 
oral QUESTION PERIOD 
APEC INQUIRY 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister claimed in the House that there was no proof that he was involved in the APEC security arrangements . 
however , documents released by the RCMP Public Complaints Commission show that the Prime Minister and his office were up to their eyeballs in taking action against the APEC protesters . 
the Prime Minister told the House that he had nothing to do with it and yet we now find that he and his staff were intricately involved . 
why did the Prime Minister and his office tell police that they had to find some way to get those protesters out of there ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this matter is being considered by the Public Complaints Commission under the former Mr. Justice Hughes . 
this is an independent tribunal . 
i suggest we let the tribunal get on with its work in examining this matter . 
i want to also point out that senior officials of the Prime Minister ' s office have already testified . 
i suggest that the hon. member look at what they have to say and take that into account as well . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as incredible as it sounds , in order to stop the protesters at the APEC meetings , the Prime Minister arranged to temporarily lease land from UBC so that he could charge any protesters for trespassing , arrest them and then throw them in jail . 
in other words , where it was perfectly legal and lawful to protest one day it suddenly became a place to charge , arrest and jail students the next day . 
are these legal shenanigans the Prime Minister ' s way of getting around the charter protected rights of these protesting students ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I reject categorically the premise of the hon. member ' s question . 
i do not accept it at all . 
i will repeat that this matter is being considered by an arm ' s length tribunal headed by a very distinguished former judge . 
he will take all these documents into account . 
let us wait until he states his conclusion . 
that is what we should do if we respect the work of the tribunal . 
that work should not be carried on in the House when the tribunal has been set up to do that work . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , here is what an independent RCMP Public Complaints Commission found . 
it found that the chief of APEC security was quoted as saying " Even they , the prime minister ' s staff , say they are not concerned about the security aspect of the Prime Minister ' s visit ; it ' s the politics of it '' . 
in other words , the Prime Minister and his office were prepared to move in on protesters , not because they did anything wrong , no , it was because the Prime Minister did not want it to look bad for the dictator Suharto . 
why did the Prime Minister pressure the RCMP to compromise the legal rights of the protesters in order to protect the dictator Suharto ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not accept , in fact I reject the premise of the hon. member ' s question . 
at the same time , I wonder why the hon. member does not respect the jurisdiction of the tribunal and wants to have its work duplicated improperly in the House . 
a very distinguished former judge is looking into this matter . 
contrary to what the hon. member has said , the tribunal has not reached any conclusions . 
we will be happy to see the conclusions and have them considered once they are reached and announced by the judge . 
why does the Reform Party not want to let the commission do its work and respect the work being done by former Mr. Justice Hughes ? 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the opposition rejects the premise of the Deputy Prime Minister ' s answers . 
he is trying to throw a wet blanket on APEC and that is not going to work . 
it is not going to go away . 
the Prime Minister still denies he was directly involved . 
let me read a quote from one of the police officers at that time . 
the police officer said " We know how we normally treat things , but then the Prime Minister is not directly involved . 
but right now the Prime Minister of our country is directly involved and he ' s going to start giving orders '' . 
what part of that quote does the Deputy Prime Minister not understand ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what I do not understand is why the Reform Party is unwilling to let an independent arm ' s length tribunal carry on its work and allow the commissioner , Mr. Hughes , to consider all the matters in question , including the evidence of senior officials of the Prime Minister ' s office , and then reach his conclusions and issue his report . 
why does the Reform Party not understand the process of justice in the country ? 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
it would be nice , Mr. Speaker , if the Deputy Prime Minister answered questions instead of asking them all the time . 
the Prime Minister on October 28 , 1998 said " At that time I did not have time to discuss anything with police . 
anybody with common sense would know that '' . 
not only was the Prime Minister burning up the phone lines , but now we learn he was busy leasing land in order to crack down on student protesters . 
how can the Prime Minister continue to stubbornly deny he was directly involved in APEC operations when everybody with common sense knows he was ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I again reject the premise of the hon. member ' s question . 
there has not been a finding to that effect by Mr. Hughes . 
the commission has not completed its hearings . 
Mr. Hughes has not rendered his judgment . 
if the hon. member asks why in addition to answering questions I ask them , I want to demonstrate that the Reform Party members on this or any other subject fail to have any real , meaningful or important answers . 
they do not have the answers and they do not have the facts .

audiovisual PRODUCTIONS 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , at the beginning of the week , the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced that the Montreal urban police were to meet yesterday with officials from Canadian Heritage and Revenue Canada . 
could the minister tell us the outcome of this meeting ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I believe the allegations are being investigated by the police . 
so I ask that we let the police do their work . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we never get an answer from this government , because everything is always under investigation . 
if the Deputy Prime Minister cannot tell us about this meeting , it is , perhaps , because the rumours are true and the meeting was not held . 
could the government tell us why the meeting between the officials and the police was cancelled ? 
Mr. Mauril B é langer ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as far as I know , the meeting did not take place because the RCMP is carrying out investigation and has asked to continue its investigation itself . 
for the ninth or 10 th time , we invite the Bloc Quebecois members , we encourage them , to contact the RCMP directly if they have any allegations or information . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau - Mirabel , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the media are reporting that Telefilm Canada is showing arrogance by refusing to answer the questions asked by journalists , preferring instead to refer them to the Access to Information Act . 
Mr. Mauril B é langer ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Telefilm Canada is not refusing to answer questions . 
members opposite and in fact all the members of this House have had many opportunities to ask questions to Telefilm officials when they have appeared before house committees , and this will continue to be the case . 
Telefilm Canada is complying with the Access to Information Act and if the hon. member is alluding to an RCMP investigation , again , we urge him to contact the RCMP directly if he wants to make allegations or communicate information . 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau - Mirabel , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in order to allow Telefilm Canada to regain its credibility , what it the Minister of Canadian Heritage waiting for to ask the auditor general to shed light on a case where the actions of a minority are detrimental to the whole television industry ? 
Mr. Mauril B é langer ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , one wonders which actions , by whom , are detrimental to whom in this House . 
* * * 
APEC INQUIRY 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , another autumn in the 1997 APEC fiasco haunts us still . 
the transcript of an RCMP conference call reveals the Prime Minister ' s office was deeply involved in security arrangements for the Vancouver summit . 
listen to what RCMP Inspector Wayne May had to say at that time . 
he is quoted as saying , " When the Prime Minister is told of this he is just going to tell them to do whatever it takes to get the protesters out of there '' . 
i would like to ask the solicitor general , the minister responsible for the RCMP , to confirm what Canadians already know , that the Prime Minister and his office had a direct role in security for the APEC summit . 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague is well aware that the Public Complaints Commission is an independent tribunal . 
Mr. Hughes is examining all information relevant to the RCMP . 
what my hon. colleague should do is let the Public Complaints Commission do its job . 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it seems to me that the APEC inquiry is about investigations into the RCMP . 
what we are interested in talking about today is what the Prime Minister ' s involvement was in all of that . 
RCMP Inspector Bill Ard is quoted as saying , " The Prime Minister wanted everybody removed . 
that was the deal and we are feeling there is no legal way to do that '' . 
in the face of these hard RCMP facts , why will the government not confirm the involvement , and indeed the interference of the Prime Minister and his office in the APEC summit in 1997 ? 
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has co - operated fully with the Public Complaints Commission . 
very senior members of the Prime Minister ' s office have testified before the commission . 
why will my hon. colleague not let the Public Complaints Commission do its job ? 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the existing chaos and menacing atmosphere resulting from the Marshall decision is taking its toll on fishermen , families and stocks . 
will the minister make a public statement that will clarify the position of his department and apply the principles of conservation for all fishermen in Canada ? 
i say to the minister , if conservation is truly coming first , why does he not prove it ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , conservation is our number one priority and we operate and manage the fishery on that basis . 
that is exactly what we are doing out there . 
i have said from day one that we will have a regulated fishery . 
we have a regulated fishery that we enforcing to ensure that we have conservation . 
i have been in contact with all the groups . 
we now have a federal representative out there speaking to the commercial industries and the aboriginal communities and working to have a practical arrangement . 
that is exactly what we are doing . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we do not have conservation , we have confusion ; confusion among the fishermen , the aboriginal people and the ministers themselves . 
it appears as if the ministers ' plan to put a negotiator in place has failed . 
now that the Sable gas plan may be interrupted , it seems that every time the federal government goes to court it loses . 
even the Liberal chair of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans stated there has to be more leadership coming from the minister . 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously the member and his party have not been listening . 
we put together both a short term and long term plan . 
they do not even recognize that in this case we cannot use the notwithstanding clause . 
* * * 
child PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is official . 
given this contradicts everything the minister said would not happen , including the child pornography case reaching the supreme court , would the parliamentary secretary tell us if the government will now invoke the notwithstanding clause ? 
Mr. John Maloney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government is committed to ensuring the safety of our children . 
we have intervened vigorously at the British Columbia Court of Appeal level and we will do the same at the Supreme Court of Canada . 
let us not forget that possession of child pornography is illegal in nine provinces and three territories . 
let us not forget that . 
also let us not forget that it is illegal to produce , to transfer , to sell child pornography . 
the government is acting well on this issue . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I still thought Alberta and B.C. were part of Canada . 
let me also remind the government that in January the parliamentary secretary who just answered the question wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to use the notwithstanding clause to solve this child pornography case , as did 62 other Liberals . 
when is the government going to bring in the notwithstanding clause and put children first instead of the sexual deviants who are still operating in this country ? 
Mr. John Maloney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this case will be heard on January 18 and 19 . 
we are vigorously defending it . 
to invoke the notwithstanding clause at this time would weaken our case , a case where we feel we are constitutionally strong .

genetically ALTERED FOODS 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , at the closing session of a meeting of the Canadian Health Food Association held in Ottawa last weekend , David Suzuki quite rightly remarked that Canadians are being used as guinea pigs for genetically altered foods . 
is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food waiting for the food inspection system to be discredited before labelling and regulating genetically altered foods , as the Bloc Quebecois requested last June ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the approval of foods no matter how they are produced and come about in Canada is a very rigorous process . 
the Ministry of Health audits and monitors the Canadian Food Inspection Agency . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie ( Louis - H é bert , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , will the government undertake to move quickly to carry out exhaustive studies of the effects on health of genetically altered foods and to increase the budgets necessary to evaluate these foods ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , no food is approved for sale in Canada unless it has gone through one of the most rigorous food inspection systems in the world . 
it takes a number of years before that process is completed . 
the best way to explain to everybody how successful and how good it is is to look at the track record . 
Canadians are fortunate to have the best food regulatory system in the world and the track record shows that . 
* * * 
pay EQUITY 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals have undermined the solid principle of pay equity by substituting their fuzzy notion of equal value work . 
the Liberals ' little experiment has wound up costing taxpayers $ 5 billion . 
worse , it has sparked a rash of similar suits that will cost consumers billions more . 
unfortunately the government ' s loss has already set a precedent in those cases . 
when is the government going to end the confusion for Canadian workers , employers and consumers by defining what it means by equal value work ? 
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is clear that there is a big difference between the Reform Party and our government . 
i remind everyone that the Reform Party in its electoral platform said : " We will discontinue employment equity programs and will repeal section 15 ( 2 ) of the charter of rights and freedoms '' . 
that is the section about equality rights . 
i do not think we have any reason to hear from the Reform Party on that . 
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pay equity is nothing but pay inequity . 
every other worker in the country can now kiss a tax cut goodbye so the government can finance its loss to the federal court . 
it is hard to see the equity in that . 
there goes the surplus . 
there goes tax relief . 
why is it that whenever the government makes a mistake , taxpayers end up paying the bill ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know where the hon. member has been . 
he certainly was not listening to the Prime Minister the other day . 
the government will continue to do this . 
the hon. member should not say things which cause confusion and misunderstanding on the part of Canadians . 
* * * 
genetically ALTERED FOODS 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in order to protect biodiversity , an international protocol on biosafety that would regulate the export and import of genetically altered organisms is now being negotiated . 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
why is Canada one of the small group of six nations blocking the accord and putting trade ahead of the protection of health and the environment ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canada is one of the group of nations that export agricultural products . 
we are also trying to have some good exchanges of views and to reduce the distance separating the opinions of the group of countries to which the hon. member referred from the other countries with their differing views . 
we are doing our best to bridge the gap and to find common ground . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , how does the minister explain that Canada is refusing to include in the biosafety protocol a clause making companies responsible for damage caused to the environment by their genetically altered products ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we will continue to work with like - minded nations which face similar problems . 
as the logic of the hon. member ' s position would indicate , the fact is we cannot simply halt international trade in foodstuffs . 
that also depends on our assisting them with technology , information and systems which will allow them to make benefit of any future accord .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the historian whose expert opinion Justice Binnie relied on in the Marshall ruling has publicly stated his testimony was twisted to fit the ruling . 
justice Binnie interpreted Professor Stephen Patterson ' s testimony as evidence that the treaties granted a permanent native right to fish or hunt , but Patterson , the person Justice Binnie relied on , does not agree . 
the decision is flawed . 
given this evidence of a flawed decision , will the government join with the West Nova Fishermen ' s Coalition in petitioning the supreme court to stay and clarify the Marshall decision ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the important thing is to work out an arrangement involving all the parties in a fair and equitable way . 
discussions are under way right now for that purpose . 
a very distinguished legal scholar has been appointed as mediator . 
we should support his work to make sure there is a fair arrangement respecting the rights of all concerned , whether the fishers are native or non - native people in any part of Canada , including Atlantic Canada . 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it would be good to hear from the fisheries minister . 
the Marshall decision establishes a race - based commercial fishery on the east coast . 
history Professor Patterson was one of the central experts cited in that case . 
he thinks the ruling was flawed . 
he said : 
why will the government not ask the supreme court to stay the Marshall decision , and clarify it ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our position has been very clear from day one . 
we have a supreme court judgment . 
we will make sure that we live within the spirit of that judgment . 
we have already recognized that treaty right . 
we are now making sure we have dialogue and co - operation . 
the Reform Party of course has a different position from the other parties in the House . 
since 1993 it has voted against every major aboriginal initiative in the House and as usual it is carrying on as it always has . 
* * * 
genetically ALTERED FOODS 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
section 5 of the Department of Industry Act provides that the minister shall exercise his powers and perform his duties " in a manner that will promote the interests and protection of Canadian consumers '' . 
in order to guarantee consumers proper information on the food they consume , would do the minister promise in this House to make it mandatory to label genetically altered foods , yes or no ? 
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , just a few days ago the grocery distributors council announced an initiative with the Canadian standards council , the industry , the provinces , the federal government and the Consumers ' Association of Canada to conduct meetings and put together a criteria for voluntary labelling . 
before we do any labelling , we have to have a criteria in place so that it will be credible and enforceable labelling . 
we recognize the consumer ' s right and desire to know and we are working in that direction .

health 
Mr. Ovid L . Jackson ( Bruce - Grey , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last June the Minister of Health tabled an announcement regarding the medical use of marijuana in a Health Canada document on the medical use of marijuana . 
the minister , under section 56 of the act , exempted two persons . 
can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health explain to the House what other actions have been taken over the summer ? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the actions of this government have shown it to be taking a humanitarian approach to people who are suffering and believe the use of marijuana would help them . 
on October 6 , the minister granted 14 exemptions under section 56 bringing the total to 16 . 
as it there has been some criticism of the procedure , the minister is undertaking consultations in order to improve it . 
he has also announced an action plan for clinical trials and an action plan to ensure a domestic source of supply within one year .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like read a quote by one of Canada ' s most infamous 80 year olds : 
there is a long term intention on the part of the government - to arrive eventually at a situation where Indians will be treated like other Canadian citizens of the particular province in which they happen to be . 
Pierre Trudeau made that comment in the House at the tender age of 49 . 
what exactly happened to the Liberals ' long term intentions when they signed the Nisga ' a treaty ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the intention of signing the Nisga ' a agreement is to bring certainty , not only to our responsibility under the constitution to first nations rights but also economic certainty to the province of British Columbia , a province that needs certainty in the forestry area . 
that is where we are at . 
that is where we were going . 
we are doing the responsible thing , and I hope the Reform Party will come to its senses and support the Nisga ' a agreement like everybody else in the House . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , assigning democratic rights according to race is offensive . 
the government is attacking the very foundation of our country . 
equality of opportunity is at the core of what it is to be Canadian . 
the government has quashed the principle of equality with the Nisga ' a treaty . 
no longer will hard work be the determining factor of whether or not one can make a living in forestry , fishing or mining . 
now success will be based on race . 
why is the government promoting a treaty that abolishes equality of opportunity ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this was the exact argument used by members of the Reform Party to keep the Sikhs out of the RCMP . 
they said that they did not want the regulations to change and that they did not want turbanned Sikhs in the RCMP . 
members of that party stood for that and they are using the same argument as they did before . 
they should be ashamed of themselves . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
perhaps hon. members should calm down for a moment . 
* * * 
water EXPORTS 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment . 
would he now admit that Canada ' s water export policy will not be decided by the Parliament of Canada , Canadian laws or the courts of Canada , but that it will essentially be decided by three faceless trade lawyers operating in secret on the basis of NAFTA trade rules ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am astonished that the NDP policy would be put forward by the hon. member in this way . 
we do not believe that bulk water is an item of trade . 
we do not think it should go to NAFTA panels . 
we think that is covered entirely within Canada by the decision of Canadians . 
the NDP may think differently . 
it may think it is a matter of trade . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
the suit for $ 15 billion is being launched now as we sit here in the House of Commons . 
one reason this is happening is that the government and the minister have been dithering on water policy . 
back in 1993 the Prime Minister said that there would be no water exports . 
we have been calling for legislation . 
will he now introduce legislation and initiate talks to remove ourselves from chapter 11 under NAFTA ? 
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member and his party keep insisting that somehow water is an item of trade which can be handled by NAFTA . 
we say no . 
we say this is a decision for Canadians , not for people elsewhere . 
we are saying no to water diversions from any of the major watersheds in Canada .

housing 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the owners of leaky condos in British Columbia are faced with tens of thousands of dollars in repair costs through no fault of their own . 
what can the minister do to help those people in B.C. ? 
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , CMHC has been at the forefront of this situation . 
it has been inviting the owners of those condos to come forward if they need financial assistance . 
we have been opening the mortgages and giving more time for payments . 
we have also consolidated mortgages and we offer all the research . 
we continue to work in helping those people in a similar situation . 
we understand it is a terrible situation but we are taking our responsibility and we are acting . 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the provincial government of B.C. agrees with the Barrett commission that condo owners should be allowed a sales tax exemption for the repairs . 
the federal government assisted people during the floodings in Manitoba and the Saguenay and during the ice storm in central Canada . 
will the minister use a little compassion and help those people through GST exemption on the repair bills for those condos . 
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as I said before , we are trying with all the means we have to help condo owners , to give them relief so they can make repairs . 
i assure the member that our financial assistance through the CMHC loan insurance program is working . 
the hon. member has made a representation that we should use retirement savings plans for those things . 
i can take that representation to the Minister of Finance , but I remind him that we did not use such things for the ice storm or the Saguenay tragedy and so on . 
we also have to keep the integrity of our retirement pension system .

health 
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today the Minister of Health made an announcement in Toronto of major funding for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research . 
can the parliamentary secretary tell us how health research will be enhanced by this new funding , and how our researchers will be able to contribute to the quality of health in Canada as a result of these new resources ? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have the great pleasure to confirm the announcement made this morning in Toronto by the Minister of Health . 
a total of $ 65 million will be injected into health research through the creation of institutes . 
their purpose will be to improve the co - ordination of health research throughout the country through involvement of both the private sector and other levels of the public sector .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , barely 60 % of the Nisga ' a themselves voted in favour of the Nisga ' a treaty . 
the fisheries minister should abandon his name calling for a while and ask the Nisga ' a why they voted against it . 
the fact is that the absence of land ownership rights is a major flaw in the Indian Act and the Nisga ' a deal . 
hundreds of band members from the Squamish reserve in my riding have come to tell me that the lack of land ownership is the single biggest impediment to self - sufficiency for aboriginal people in Canada . 
how can the government support a treaty that works against individual property rights and that has been completely rejected for that reason by some of the Nisga ' a and the Liberal Party of B.C. ? 
hon. Robert D . Nault ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will try one again more time . 
it is very important for the member opposite to read the agreement . 
if the member wants to listen he will know that in the agreement it is not the case that there are no land rights for individual Nisga ' a people . 
they can in the agreement set up a land code which will allow through fee simple for the individual Nisga ' a owners to have a deed to that property based on their own regulations as a government .

bill C - 6 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Minister of National Revenue stated that his colleague , the Minister of Industry , had already responded to numerous requests from the Government of Quebec to avoid any form of duplication following passage of Bill C - 6 on electronic commerce . 
however , contrary to that statement , the Minister of Industry did not propose any amendment of satisfaction to Quebec . 
why is the government refusing to meet Quebec ministers concerning an issue as important as the protection of personal information before ramming through the House a bill that could easily have been put on hold until after such a meeting ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to tell the hon. member that the protection of personal information is a very important issue for all Canadians , including Quebecers . 
we already discussed on two occasions the idea of such a bill with the ministers responsible for the information highway . 
personally , I do not understand -

gasoline PRICING 
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the consumer price index shows that the price of energy , the linchpin of our economy , is driving inflation hard . 
overall energy costs are up 13 % over the past year , but gas prices are at record highs . 
these high energy prices are driving up rail and trucking costs and reducing the disposable incomes of Canadians while giving big oil companies record profits . 
why has the Minister of Industry ignored the competition problems in gasoline retailing when the clear result has been record high gas prices , higher inflation and the potential for higher interest and mortgage rates ? 
when will he start protecting consumers instead of big business ? 
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
if the Government of Saskatchewan wishes to follow the example of the Government of Prince Edward Island , the Government of Quebec and what is proposed in Newfoundland to have a provincial pricing regime for gasoline , let the member take it to his own government which is of his own political stripe . 
* * * 
fisheries 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , tensions on the east coast remain high . 
it will come to no one ' s surprise to say that since the minister has become the minister of fisheries he has been sleepwalking through the Marshall file . 
it is even more shocking that the current Minister of the Environment , the former minister of fisheries , did not even give a political heads up to the new minister on the issue . 
given that these two ministers and cabinet in general have , to be polite , lost all credibility on the issue , will the Deputy Prime Minister stand in the House today and make two principles very clear : that conservation and preservation of lobsters stocks are paramount and , second , that the livelihoods of traditional fishers will not be jeopardized by any potential decision that DFO may undertake ? 
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member is interested in conservation he should be congratulating the Minister of the Environment because he has taken a lead role throughout his term by putting conservation as the priority , our government position , and we followed that through . 
as far as commercial fishermen , I have said in the House before that the long term solution will not be at the expense of our traditional commercial fishermen and their families . 
this is a solution that we all have to sit down and negotiate , and that is exactly what we are doing through dialogue and co - operation .

health AND SAFETY 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour . 
for 50 years health and safety provisions in the workplace have not been reviewed . 
what action will the Ministry of Labour take to modernize health and safety issues ? 
Mrs. Judi Longfield ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the House should know that the issue of occupational health and safety in the workplace is very important to the government . 
we are very pleased to note that employers and employees have become more comfortable of late in addressing concerns in the workplace . 
we are also very pleased that there has been a genuine willingness on the part of employers and employees to work with government to bring forth a new regulatory regime which will address the current realities of workplace health and safety . 
to that end the Minister of Labour will be introducing amendments in the near future .

aboriginal AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am a Sikh and I am living proof that the Reform Party believes in equality . 
why does the fisheries minister support policies that segregate Canadians and create inequality ? 
i challenge the fisheries minister to debate equality and the Nisga ' a treaty with me in Vancouver . 
some hon. members : 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i did not hear a question there . 
perhaps we can move on .

APEC SUMMIT 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , six columns on the front page of this morning ' s National Post are devoted to comments by RCMP Superintendent Wayne May that the PMO and the Prime Minister himself intervened directly in RCMP decisions concerning APEC summit security . 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister . 
how does he square these comments , which came out in RCMP testimony , with the repeated statements we have heard in this House from his government ? 
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there was also testimony from representatives of the PMO . 
the hon. member must give sufficient weight not just to the allegations she is mentioning today , but also to what spokespersons from the PMO said . 
this is before a commission operating at arm ' s length from the government . 
it is headed by a very distinguished gentleman .

airline INDUSTRY 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the transport minister is trying to decide the future of Canada ' s airline industry all by himself . 
in August he suspended the Competition Act . 
in September he blocked Liberal MPs from attending a transport meeting . 
in October he stacked the House of Commons transport committee . 
now his November plan is to get the cabinet to give him the sole power to decide the future of the airline industry . 
why does the minister think that only he knows what is best ? 
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , not only did I not know that I was so nefarious , but I did not know I had so much power , especially over my own colleagues . 
the fact is that this whole process has been a very open one and will become even more so now that the standing committees of both houses are looking at this matter . 
as I have said repeatedly , airline policy will be made by the government after consultation with members of the House and the Senate . 
i thought that was our role as a parliament and as a government . 
perhaps the hon. member can tell me otherwise .

the Deputy Speaker : 
i have notice of a point of order from the hon. member for Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
Mr. Speaker , there seems to have been some misunderstanding earlier today . 
i wonder if I could seek the consent of the House to table , as part of the proceedings , the notice of claim and demand for arbitration filed by Sun Belt Water against the Government of Canada .

points OF ORDER 
question PERIOD 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , during question period today a member on the other side of the House used what I consider to be unparliamentary language for this House . 
the member for Lakeland , when the President of the Treasury Board was answering a question , said " You are lying through your teeth '' . 
then when the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was responding to a question , he yelled twice " You are a number one scum ball '' . 
i am not aware of the type of language that the member for Lakeland uses outside of the House , but one thing is clear , that is unparliamentary language and I would ask that the member for Lakeland apologize and withdraw those comments . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Dewdney - Alouette . 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , in response to the member ' s point of order , I think , as you are well aware , our emotions run high during question period and during debate in this place . 
in fact , the member for Peterborough last week called me a racist in this place . 
i did not get up and ask for a withdrawal of that remark . 
i think the hon. member knows that if we were to stop and look at all the comments that were said in this place we might be having points of order forever . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
perhaps the hon. member for Lakeland could clarify the matter . 
if the statements alleged by the hon. member were stated , they clearly were unparliamentary and would not have been allowed . 
i must say that as Speaker I thought I heard one of the alleged statements quite clearly . 
i did not step up because I did not know who said it . 
i would ask the hon. member for Lakeland to clarify the situation . 
if he did say those things , perhaps he could withdraw the words . 
i think it would be best if that were done immediately and we could simply end the matter here . 
if he did not , we will hear that from him . 
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I admit that I do get a little excited by some of the so - called answers , and I completely withdraw any comments that the hon. member finds offensive . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i thank the hon. member .

they feel that it is time for , and that they deserve , a tax break and they so indicate by these petitions . 
the SENATE 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to present a petition on behalf of residents of my riding , as well as throughout Canada , who wish to see the Senate abolished . 
they recognize that it is an unelected house and Canadians do not need people looking over their shoulders who are not elected representatives . 
therefore they would like the unelected house to be abolished .

government ORDERS 
personal INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , for the information of our viewers , I would like to point out that today we are debating Bill C - 6 at third reading stage . 
today is the one and only day of debate on this bill at third reading , because the government has decided to gag all those of us who would have liked to give their point of view on this bill after today ' s debate . 
those who are familiar with House procedure know that Friday is the sitting day that has the shortest period for government orders . 
two elected ministers representing the people of Quebec asked for a meeting and got no other answer than the one given here during Oral Question Period , namely that the federal government was not interested in meeting them , that it was not interested in their point of view , that it had decided to go ahead because it believed it was in the public ' s best interest to do so . 
last week , this same government delivered lengthy speeches , claiming to be co - operating in what it called the Canadian approach . 
but there is the rhetoric , and then there is the reality . 
today , we are talking about the reality , and the reality is that there is no co - operation . 
and then the federal government wonders why , year after year , for the past 35 or 40 years , more and more people in Quebec want out of this political system . 
as a result , none of the witnesses were able to comment on them when they appeared before the committee . 
i will mention two in particular , which are extremely worrying . 
in Division 1 of the bill , which deals with the protection of personal information , clause 7 says , and I quote : 
7 . ( 1 ) For the purpose of clause 4.3 of Schedule 1 , and despite the note that accompanies that clause , an organization may collect personal information without the knowledge or consent of the individual only if - 
we are talking about exceptions whereby the government could , without the knowledge of the individual - what is meant by that is explained further on - collect information without the consent of this individual . 
and then comes the list of exceptions . 
the government bill provides for an exception for investigative bodies in specific instances . 
that exception , for investigative bodies , applies to circumstances where the government believes or has reasonable grounds to believe that offences have been committed . 
therefore , it is possible , under such circumstances , not to comply with the act . 
this started out as a rather limited definition or exception . 
already , in committee , that definition began to be broadened a little . 
d ) made on the initiative of the organization to an investigative body and the information relates to an offence under the laws of Canada or a province that has been or is about to be committed - 
and then this has been added : 
- or to activities suspected of constituting threats to the security of Canada ; 
in the committee hearings , this concept of exception began to be broadened . 
( i ) it suspects that the information relates to national security , the defence of Canada or the conduct of international affairs , 
so , there is now reference not to " reasonable grounds " but to suspicions and three categories are defined : " national security '' , " defence of Canada " and " conduct of international affairs '' . 
knowing how paranoid the government gets when sovereignist members of parliament go overseas and do a good job of expressing Quebec ' s point of view , we also must ask how far the government will go in its suspicions about international affairs and national security . 
if this is not enough to worry you , it certainly is enough to worry me and I am convinced that it also worries a lot of Canadians . 
i hope that the Privacy Commissioner will also be worried . 
i am looking forward to hearing his comments on the proposed amendments , as the minister quoted him earlier as speaking highly of this act . 
i am convinced that the commissioner will not approve of this initiative and of these last minute amendments . 
as if by chance , and I have a hard time believing that the government did not mean to do this from the beginning , these amendments were tabled after the committee hearings . 
it is as if the government had not wanted to hear people ' s comments on this particular part of the act . 
the government has presented another motion dealing with investigative bodies . 
i will attempt a comparison here . 
for the investigative bodies who believe that there was a violation , the exception will apply if they have reasonable cause to believe that the violation occurred . 
for the investigative bodies , the words are " reasonable cause to believe '' . 
however , where national security or the conduct of international affairs arre involved , suspicion is enough . 
it is in fact a lot more reasonable to require a reasonable cause than only a suspicion . 
but then again , this does not mean that there was no recourse in the past . 
it is possible to swear out a warrant to obtain information . 
to obtain such a warrant , one must explain why the information is needed . 
the system offers some protection , since the warrant is issued by a judge who must ensure that the information required will be obtained by appropriate means . 
however , there is much cause for concern . 
i said so earlier this week in a press conference . 
we do not know how the government will use the information and what it really has in mind . 
it is the Big Brother syndrome . 
the government wants to control all kinds of information and is setting up the legislative framework it needs to do whatever it wants . 
the provisions of this bill give rise to many very serious concerns . 
let me repeat our objections . 
second , a harmonization and discussion process was started with the provinces to establish a common framework . 
however , the federal government pulled out of this process and decided that it would decide on its own what is good and in the interest of the people . 
why ? 
for reasons of international visibility , because Canada wants to show leadership and boast that it passed legislation . 
yet , the bill is riddled with loopholes . 
even if in some parts of the bill the government is proposing measures that are both flawed and vague , it can still say that is does have legislation . 
there is more to it than just passing a law . 
there has to be some real impact to it . 
this gives us another reason to oppose this bill , since the protection of personal information under this bill is subject to many conditions . 
it will be hard to enforce this bill . 
the people who want to do e - commerce have a lot to gain by using personnel information , but the citizens would have liked better protection . 
here again , we have another reason to oppose this bill . 
it is easy to play with rhetoric . 
i listened earlier to those who are in favour of the bill . 
they were defending some fundamental principles , as if they were speaking on a motion to protect personal information . 
i am also very surprised to see that federal Liberal members from Quebec are not interested in this issue and come to the House only to reiterate what has been said by the industry minister , who does not seem to care much about what is going on in Quebec in this area as in many others . 
there was not a peep out of these Liberal members . 
we did not hear from them , we did not see them . 
it is as if they simply did not care . 
who are they defending ? 
are they defending their government in Quebec , or are they defending their Quebec voters in Ottawa ? 
the answer is the first option . 
these people are strictly propaganda agents in Quebec , nothing else . 
this is very regretful . 
next week , and this is my prediction , we will see another example of this with the Young Offenders Act . 
these Liberal " carpet MPs " from Quebec will do the same thing . 
not one of them will rise . 
yet , there is a great deal of opposition in Quebec regarding the legislation on young offenders , as there is regarding the bill now before us . 
and this opposition is not just from the Bloc Quebecois or the Quebec government . 
the Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information presented a very detailed submission to the committee . 
the Barreau du Qu é bec also came and said the same things . 
the Chambre des notaires du Qu é bec told us about the problems that this bill would create . 
but this is not important to the Minister of Industry . 
it does not bother him at all . 
he does not even want to take the time to discuss his bill with the Quebec government , is spite of repeated requests to that effect . 
this all began in November 1998 . It continued in January , in April , and recently through letters . 
the government never agreed to meet the expectations and requests of the Quebec government . 
to conclude , this is my last intervention on this bill . 
my colleague , the hon. member for Mercier , will use up the time left . 
i will conclude by saying that even if the bill is passed by next week , the government will continue to hear about it because , as far as we are concerned , the fight will not be over . 
there will be a lot of practical issues and we will be here day after day to remind the Minister of Industry of the negative impact that his bill will have in Quebec . 
the minister will still hear from us . 
i hope that some Liberal MPs from Quebec will soon wake up and remember , when the time comes to vote next week , who elected them and whom they should represent in this House . 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , first I want to thank my colleague from T é miscamingue for sharing his speaking time with me . 
he knows how much the fight against this legislation is close to my heart , and I think that he is carrying the torch beautifully , as usual . 
i know he will continue to fight in this House against this legislation that cannot be allowed to go unchanged . 
having followed this legislation through all the stages since its tabling in early September , last year , effectively suspending the long - standing consultation process between the provinces and the federal government , it is clear to me that the minister of Industry could have used the time available to him to try to harmonize his bill with the Quebec legislation . 
but he obviously did not even try to do so . 
and yet , this minister is an intelligent man . 
why has he not tried to make stock of the Quebec experience ? 
there is no personal information protection culture . 
neither is there sufficient training for the public . 
in Quebec however the law was starting to be seriously applied . 
instead of building on this experience , the minister has developed an altogether new logic based on a national standard originally designed as a voluntary measure by businesses . 
that is what he would rather have . 
he decided to change this proposal , which was not as stringent as a legislative proposal would be . 
he made it into a legislative proposal and an appendix to the bill . 
based on the opinion of several legal counsels and according to witnesses who appeared before the committee , this is the worst legislation ever developed . 
but this act is not just any act . 
it does not respect the spirit of the Speech from the Throne and is not some kind of government provision . 
no , it is an act similar to the Labour Code . 
this act is one people will actually have to work with . 
citizens who want their personal information to be protected will depend on it . 
the situation will be extremely confusing for Quebecers . 
why ? 
precisely because the minister decided to ignore Quebec ' s experience and did not even try to accommodate Quebec ' s act . 
he chose to use a completely different logic . 
let me say this : 
but some of the individuals who participated in this process told me that they would never have done it had they known that their work might be used as the foundation for a piece of legislation , because it was not designed for legislative purposes . 
it does not specifically provide citizens with rights . 
we are now reviewing a legislation that will soon be enacted . 
on the pretext of dealing with electronic commerce , this federal act would infringe upon a jurisdiction that comes under the provinces , and Quebec in particular . 
i noticed that the other provinces , after reacting strongly , through their justice ministers , when they looked into the federal government ' s bill , decided to put up with this , with the exception of Ontario with regard to health information , and maybe a number of other provinces in western Canada . 
the fact is that they did not have any legislation in that area . 
this bill , which will soon become law , means that Quebec will have to enforce a federal act in an area under provincial jurisdiction . 
one must know that , prior to the federal government legislating in that area , personal information enjoyed complete protection under Quebec ' s legislation . 
according to the legal interpretations we have seen , only the adoption of a federal act could challenge the application of the provincial act . 
again , I do not know what decisions will be made but , for the time being , Quebec ' s legislation continues to provide complete protection with regard to personal information . 
what does the federal act do ? 
it says - actually , it is the minister who introduced it and the government that supported it who had the nerve to say this - that , in an area that comes under Quebec ' s jurisdiction , it will be up to the federal government to decide in which circumstances the provincial act will apply , in what area and to which organizations . 
what a mess . 
will this mess promote better enforcement of the law ? 
it will , and for a long time , not provide greater protection but , on the contrary , slow down the process that gave Quebec a system that was working more and more smoothly . 
let me say briefly that , contrary the federal legislation , Quebec ' s legislation is clear . 
people can see what their rights are . 
it is easy to apply because any citizen can go to the Human Rights Commission where , after an inquiry , a decision is rendered . 
the Commission can make a ruling and exercise this right so all citizens can obtain justice . 
for most people , the issue of personal information protection is about changing some incorrect information contained in a person ' s file . 
after reviewing the case , the commissioner makes a recommendation which is forwarded to the complainant . 
a report is produced within a year and if the complainant is not satisfied , he or she may take the case before the federal court . 
of course , the Privacy Commissioner can also decide , in exceptional cases , to take the case himself before the federal court . 
otherwise , after the long process provided in the bill , the complainant is back at square one and still has to pay if he wants the recommendation to become a ruling . 
i heard the minister say that Canadians want their personal information protected . 
yes , they do and they should not have to wait . 
there is more . 
what will he do ? 
he will either not file a complaint at all or file one with the wrong government , in which case the legal time limit could expire . 
this legislation will create more confusion . 
it is for good reason then that , on five occasions , Quebec ' s ministers wrote to the industry minister and requested a meeting with him , and asked him to postpone the process in order to harmonize it . 
we , members of the Bloc Quebecois , have repeatedly tried to convince the industry committee and the minister to take advantage of the delays during the session of Parliament , or even of the summer recess , to make an attempt at harmonization . 
why did the government not try to do it ? 
it is a system that , in theory , allows different cultures and languages to coexist . 
i say theoretically because the process of legislation on personal information in which I have been involved for more than a year is not the least bit flexible . 
according to the theoreticians , including those working for the Forum of Federations , federations work best in homogeneous countries . 
that is the problem . 
the problem is that Quebec is a people and a nation . 
its privacy legislation is governed by civil law , with its origins in France . 
but it is civil law . 
the rest of Canada is governed by common law - this is not a defect , just a difference . 
in fact , in the western world there are two major traditions , civil law and common law . 
now , instead of trying to take the difference into consideration , the federal government has chosen to eliminate it . 
this is one more lesson . 
any student of law , politics or anyone else wanting to know the status of Canadian federalism has only to trace the process of passage of this legislation . 
it is a significant piece of legislation , since it goes to the very heart of Quebec civil law . 
earlier this week , I had the opportunity to accompany the minister to the G - 8 summit , where one of the issues addressed was e - commerce security . 
as I discovered , and the minister ought to have before me , when there are international negotiations on harmonization - as there will have to be , because a degree of harmonization on personal information based on existing legislation will be necessary - he will find that Quebec is not alone . 
the European countries with their differences and their civil law will do as Quebec has done , use a definition of a positive right for citizens . 
he may also , of course , find there are other countries with a common law tradition that will settle for standards - I will withdraw that expression - will prefer protection related to standards to which businesses agree to comply . 
someday , negotiations will have to take place , and Canada could have benefited from the fact that it still has a province , Quebec , which has a civil law tradition , instead of trying to bury this tradition and replace it by something else . 
instead of making good use of the time it had on its hands to harmonize both legislations , it has steadfastly refused to do it . 
instead of using to its advantage the Quebec experience to deal with an issue that is quite difficult , as it will find out , it preferred to go about it in a completely different way , with a totally different logic , by relying almost totally on businesses ' co - operation . 
quite well . 
everything is fine when businesses do co - operate , but what happens when they do not ? 
what should we do ? 
should we let private citizens fend for themselves ? 
of course not . 
that is the problem . 
when the citizens ' rights are not clearly and precisely spelled out , when the means to have them respected are not free and efficient , we can have all the legislation we want , it is of no use to them . 
instead of using the Quebec experience , in which companies will have to abide by a certain set of rules , it will force companies in Quebec to follow two set of rules , never knowing for sure which one applies . 
the government has refused to even try to harmonize its legislation with the one in Quebec . 
instead of taking this advantage it will soon need in international negotiation , that is the experience of harmonizing two great traditions , the civil law and the common law , the government chose to set one of these traditions aside , the French one , to bury it , and forget about it . 
the Chambre des notaires is extremely concerned about the definitions of signature . 
the Chambre des notaires can only accept a document if the signature meets the conditions set out in the Quebec Civil Code . 
this is a whole aspect of French live , Quebec tradition and culture which is at stake , and the minister , instead of understanding the intensity of the responses triggered by this , and the depth of the problems created , prefers to ignore the whole thing . 
i believe this bill , when it becomes law , will come back to haunt the government because it is not true that it will promote the development of electronic commerce . 
everybody has been saying that people must feel safer before they engage in more electronic commerce . 
this bill will certainly not achieve this goal in Quebec , on the contrary . 
it creates - as if on purpose , but let us assume it is not on purpose - additional problems for every Quebec company and for all the companies that do business in Quebec . 
at the international level also , this bill will come back to haunt the government . 
for my part , I came to the full realization , once again , that when it comes to the legislative process , Canadian federalism is not consistent with the main characteristics of federalism . 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the last presentation and I agree with some of the points that the hon. member made . 
i am delighted to participate in today ' s debate . 
this is probably one of the most important debates that we will have in the House for some time dealing with the future of the country . 
i know it must be difficult after lunch to have so many members in the Chamber trying to stay awake to listen to my presentation . 
i remember giving a speech once and there was a young man in the back of the crowd . 
he kept saying , " Yea , yea '' . 
i thought it was very nice and very encouraging . 
at the end of my speech I was commenting to one of my friends about this young man ' s enthusiasm . 
in any event , I know , Mr. Speaker , that you will be listening to my presentation today . 
i feel very enthusiastic about speaking to Bill C - 6 today . 
the bill aims to support and promote electronic commerce by increasing Canadians ' confidence in online transactions , providing protection for personal information that is collected , adjusting the legal framework for the electronic environment and providing an alternative means for the federal government to provide services to Canadians . 
i direct my comments in particular to the people in the gallery who I think sometimes get the wrong impression that we are here in the Chamber fist - fighting , arguing and yelling at each other all the time when in fact most of the time it is fairly boring here . 
i mean boring in a sense that it is very straightforward . 
i am probably not going to change that mode this afternoon as I make my presentation on Bill C - 6 . 
i normally like to be a bit more flamboyant in my presentations but this is a very detailed piece of legislation . 
- the bill will take the most important step in defence of individual privacy since passage of the Privacy Act bound the federal government in 1982 . 
in terms of our concern here in this place for people ' s security and the security of their personal information , whether it is medical records , financial records or whatever , this piece of legislation takes us further than any other piece of legislation , bar none , with the exception perhaps of the Privacy Act itself . 
the privacy commissioner goes on to say that the bill is a major leap forward by providing a mechanism for independent oversight , mandating the Privacy Commissioner of Canada to investigate complaints , issue reports and conduct audits . 
as a last resort , it provides recourse to the federal court and empowers the court to award damages when it feels the penalty is justified . 
i could go on and on , but the privacy commissioner basically states that this is really important and significant legislation . 
it recognizes that the world of commerce , in which all of us participate either in our roles as businesses or as consumers , is more different today than it ever has been . 
it has taken on a speed and operates 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . 
it is not a nine to five operation any more as it used to be just a handful of years ago . 
there is indeed a business - industry revolution taking place before our eyes . 
the transactions are so horrendous in both scope and speed that something has to be done in order to protect Canadians ' private information . 
when we make a call to purchase some goods over the telephone and are asked for our VISA number , I suspect we are hesitant to give it . 
however , that is the way it is . 
we have to give it . 
goodness knows where the heck it is going and who is going to be using it . 
hopefully , the person at the other end of the line is not an unscrupulous type . 
since we will be talking a lot today about the Internet and electronic commerce , I want to share with my colleagues a funny little quote that I read somewhere which describes the Internet as " A worldwide network of university , government , business and private computer systems all run by a 13 year old kid named Jason '' . 
we all smile because we know that children are very comfortable with these new technologies . 
in fact , I suspect that most adult learn their skills from their children when it comes to learning how to work our computers . 
when we talk about implementing legislation in the public interest , we have to acknowledge the entire public , and clearly that includes the young people of the country who are probably a whole lot more tuned in to what I am talking about today than most people . 
the federal government has been at this experiment for many years . 
we started with the constitution and the charter of rights rooted in certain basic values . 
the people who drafted our constitution and the charter of rights understood that times would change . 
indeed , they understood that definitions of fundamental things like privacy would also change . 
they also understood that circumstances would require people to rise to the challenges of each new era by applying the old values but in very practical ways . 
in the past , this change occurred when we went from an agriculture economy to an industrial economy . 
this change is now occurring with the move toward a new modern digital economy . 
it is our responsibility to fight to adapt our institutions to new economies and markets and to update and modernize our citizens ' rights to uphold their right to privacy in the midst of these vast economic transformations occurring before us . 
in the past , leaders recognized and lived up to this responsibility . 
now it is our opportunity and our responsibility to do the same once again . 
the pace of change , not just the nature of change , is very different . 
once again it is our responsibility to respond to this change applying the oldest basic values and principles in practical ways that will allow them to not only be preserved but enhanced by our modern technologies during these modern times . 
we all recognize that technology has revolutionized the way we live and the way we do business . 
i suspect that we have only seen the beginning of this . 
i am sure that many of us , in different ways , have experienced how new technology , such as the Internet , can be a valuable tool and a valuable resource . 
however , it is only valuable when placed at the service of humanity . 
technology , by its very nature , requires unconditional respect for the fundamental interests of society . 
on this theme there are only two direct topics that I would like to focus my remarks on today . 
first , Internet technology must be at the service of humanity and of unalienable rights . 
it must respect the prerogatives of a civil society , among which is the protection of our privacy . 
second , guiding principles and values cannot be inferred from mere technological efficiencies of from the usefulness occurring to some at the expense of others . 
new technologies must promote our integral development for the benefit of all citizens of our country . 
today I am going to concentrate my remarks about Bill C - 6 on these two topics . 
we have all made presentations in the House over the last little while about some of the very specifics of the legislation as well as its overall thrust . 
i want to focus simply on two topics , the first one being the protection of our basic rights . 
it is obvious that new technology and the amazing advances that have been made in telecommunications have changed the way we all communicate with each other . 
there is no question that we are living through a revolution in the telecommunications industry with cheaper , easier to use and faster ways to communicate and do business with people within our homes , communities and around the globe . 
i believe that on the whole the Internet and electronic commerce do present outstanding possibilities for the advancement of our basic rights and values and , on the whole , are very beneficial tools to the citizens of Canada . 
no doubt things such as education and commerce will be improved in the next few years because of the Internet . 
generally speaking , our daily lives will likely be improved . 
the other day I was visiting an elementary school . 
one young boy said " I will run out and find out . 
i will get on the Internet and I will come back '' . 
i did not quite know what he was talking about , but he came back with a long printout of all the answers to the questions that I had been asking . 
in other words , this little boy knew he could run out , get on the Internet and find out information that would probably take me a good day of searching in some library to find out . 
i realize I have a long way to go to catch up to this young person who , in this case , was probably in grade five . 
a byproduct of this technological revolution is that supervising our rights takes on a new dimension of responsibility . 
new Democrats realize that when the world changes so do our responsibilities . 
just because new technologies are developed does not mean that our basic rights and responsibilities no longer apply . 
at the present time there is very little protection or , More precisely , there is no legislative protection or legal deterrent of our privacy rights in cyberspace . 
there are mostly voluntary codes for businesses to follow . 
whatever exists , it does not loom large in cyberspace . 
not really . 
i do not think so , nor do most Canadians . 
the task before us is to make our laws and principles apply to changing technology . 
the old laws may require some redefinition but the same old general principles around protecting our privacy rights must stand very firm . 
we must find the means to protect our personal information in modern times . 
we cannot be neutral in the development of or application of these new technologies . 
it is not acceptable that these new technologies be endorsed simply because of their efficiency . 
in the interest of advancing human rights , we all have a responsibility to make sure that new technologies respect the values of a civil society , among which is the protection of our privacy rights . 
that is where legislation like Bill C - 6 comes into play . 
all sorts of organizations and companies have personal details about us in their computer databases . 
the chances are very good that most of us have had , at some point or another , our mailboxes stuffed and overflowing with catalogues , sales ads , prize offers which we never requested and probably do not want . 
how many times have one of us been notified that we have won a huge benefit or something and all we have to do is phone up , pay a couple of thousand dollars and they will send it to us ? 
there are all kinds of legitimate initiatives but there are also a lot of scams out there . 
the point is that somebody somewhere gets hold of our personal addresses and of information about us personally . 
we now know that companies have sold or traded mailing lists containing our personal information time and time again . 
the public concern is that if the information is entirely wrong , is out of date , is confused with someone else ' s , or , in the worst scenario , the information is abused , it can actually cause serious problems . 
people could be unfairly treated , denied jobs , housing , benefits , insurance , credit or even a spot in a university . 
today information is becoming increasingly valuable . 
information is a valuable commodity and New Democrats believe we have to be leaders in developing these new ways of doing business through protecting individual ' s privacy . 
we obviously have to protect our privacy rights . 
we also have to ensure that we solve the problem that we set out to fix and that the solution is in the best interest of our society . 
on the whole , I think the answer to that question is yes . 
that is why New Democrats will be supporting Bill C - 6 at this particular reading . 
i want to address one other theme before I close and that is ensuring that new technologies benefit all of us . 
i want to begin discussing this second theme , which is the need to ensure that we all have opportunity to benefit from the new technologies , by saying a variety of all commentators from all sorts of disciplines have commented on the increasingly important role that electronic commerce is playing in the lives of everyday people . 
i do not often quote the chairman and CEO of Bell Canada , but I guess we try everything once in our lives . 
Mr. Jean Monty told delegates at the Ottawa OECD conference last fall that " What we are witnessing today is the birth of a new economy , a new economic order that is based on networks and chips . " 
a quick glance at the current electronic commerce situation in this country reveals that not all Canadians are being given the same opportunity to participate in this new economic order . 
if we assume , and I believe this is a safe assumption , that 30 % of Canadians have some sort of access to the Internet , and this may just be the fact that they have a connected computer at their school , we must acknowledge that about three - quarters of Canadians remain in the dark . 
even worse , many Canadians in rural areas have begun to voice concerns that they may see exorbitant increases in the cost of local phone services in the near future . 
traditionally , phone companies were able to subsidize local phone rates in rural areas with money taken from long distance funds and urban areas . 
however , with the increased competition in the long distance market through deregulation , these subsidies are drying up . 
if future governments cannot ensure reasonable local phone rates for rural Canadians , I wonder then how they can expect the farmer in rural Saskatchewan for example to invest in a second phone line for Internet purposes . 
it is the government ' s responsibility and indeed our responsibility to make sure that all Canadians have the necessary opportunities to participate in the new economy . 
in the case of businesses , we have heard small and medium size businesses complain that the costs of participating in electronic commerce are often simply prohibitive from their point of view . 
the costs are keeping electronic commerce in the big leagues and small businesses could be put at a competitive disadvantage as a result . 
on another issue , it is impossible to deny that when electronic commerce becomes the way of doing business , thousands of Canadians will risk losing their jobs . 
many commentators , including American expert Jeremy Rifkin , have warned of the adverse effects electronic technology will have on society . 
there is a potential danger that as e - commerce takes off , whole types of workers could easily be displaced . 
those at risk are a diverse group , everyone from stockbrokers to call centre operators , to shipping clerks in warehouses . 
a society in which there is a large pool of labourers with displaced skills and no work and a group of information elites is not what New Democrats want . 
at the Ottawa OECD conference , Mr. Bill Conner , the general secretary of Britain ' s largest union for retail employees , expressed disappointment that " the meeting did not consider in any detail e - commerce ' s potentially devastating effects on traditional low and middle income workers '' . 
he added that the euphoria over the potential for exponential growth of e - commerce overshadowed concerns about what may be left in its wake . 
this is certainly not a good thing to see . 
it demonstrates a lack of vision and a lack of ability to see the big picture . 
it is not working toward our goal of ensuring the majority of Canadians have the opportunity to participate in the new economy . 
we New Democrats agree that Canada must be a world leader in e - commerce technology . 
however , we also believe that true leadership requires attention to all of the implications of this issue . 
that is essentially the difference between our party and some of the others that have spoken to this legislation . 
i know my time is limited and I have much more I would like to say , but I am not going to have a chance . 
i will simply say that in terms of protecting privacy , as the privacy commissioner has indicated , this is a major step forward . 
however , in terms of those people who will clearly be displaced by the introduction and the expansion of e - commerce , this is something that all of us must take much more seriously unless we are going to have an increasing society of those who have and those who have not . 
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would simply like to say that the member for Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys gave us an excellent speech dealing with the opportunities and the challenges of e - commerce . 
i would suggest that all members of the House read that very thoughtful speech and take to heart many of the points the member made . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments by my hon. colleague . 
i have known him for a long time and respect the work he has done in the House of Commons . 
i know the government has introduced the possibility of implementing Internet sites across the country that would be serviced by 10,000 young people with Internet skills and presumably other computer skills . 
that is obviously a major step in the right direction , but let us not lose sight of the ongoing need to properly educate and train people . 
it is fair to say we all agree that one of the impediments to the process is the tremendously high tuition fees students face at our universities , colleges and technical schools . 
the economic burden is sometimes prohibitive and a lot of people who ought to be improving their educational training skills are unable to do so . 
we should take the bold step and acknowledge that if we are moving into the knowledge based economy of the 21 st century , we should ensure that everyone has equal access to our colleges and universities . 
we should consider joining the other 16 OECD countries that have tuition free colleges and universities . 
the cost would be $ 2.6 billion . 
we have a contingency fund in this year ' s budget of $ 3 billion . 
if we had the will to do that today , we have the finances that would ensure that every young person and not so young person in the country had access to university and college education without paying any tuition fees . 
can anyone imagine a better millennium project for the government and parliament than to implement such a program . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on this issue , the government ' s position or rather its insensitivity in setting up a system that contradicts or even impacts on the whole concept of civil law , is of course well known . 
i would like to know how the NDP member would have reacted . 
he is obviously arguing in favour of an act like the bill before us . 
is he at least more sensitive with respect to the complaints made to the government ? 
on that , I would like to quote the Quebec bar association , which said that the protection of personal information is under provincial jurisdiction because it concerns property and civil law . 
we all know that the Quebec system is based on civil law and not common law and that important practical problems are to be expected . 
there is a simple appeal mechanism , not too complicated , that does not involve the traditional courts , where things are complicated and intimidating . 
would the NDP member and his party have the same approach as the government or would they be a bit more flexible ? 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
Mr. Speaker , I am well aware of the interventions made by the groups during the hearings into this legislation that my hon. friend referred to . 
i acknowledge that he has a point . 
the situation in Quebec is significantly different than in most other parts of the country . 
i acknowledge that the government has taken some steps in this direction . 
we have much to learn from the Quebec experience particularly in terms of the appeals process my friend has referred to . 
i am not an expert in this field but perhaps there are other areas we could learn from . 
the important thing is to acknowledge as a country that we are poised on the edge of revolutionary change in the way society operates as a result of these new technologies . 
we are in a position to take global leadership on this issue . 
if this legislation takes us one more step toward that , Canada can lead the way in the development of new technologies . 
canada can show other countries ways of approaching these issues by implementing policies both in terms of privacy and in terms of acknowledging and not forgetting the people who will be replaced by technology . 
we have a great contribution to make not only to future generations of Canadians but indeed to the world itself . 
Mr. Pierre Brien : 
i fully share his concern that there must be a legislative framework , that Canada wants to take a leadership role and fulfil its own obligations . 
i have no objection to that . 
however , the problem we have is that , in order to meet a need in other parts of Canada , in the nine provinces of Canada , the government is significantly changing a balance that was in the making because of a very progressive law in Quebec . 
is the New Democratic Party open to the idea that some asymmetry could be allowed occasionally , or does it feel that there should be a national objective at all cost , and too bad if Quebec already has its own legislation ? 
their point of view is : " We Canadians need a law , therefore we will impose it to Quebecers too , because we need that law and we want to play a role '' . 
is there not room for recognition , in the federal legislation , of the Quebec legislation , and should it not simply say that , where legislation on the protection of personal information already exists , that legislation will be allowed to apply ? 
this especially true in the case of Quebec - I know it could be different in the case of the other provinces - as Quebec has a civil law system , while the other provinces have a common law system that is different in its approach and philosophy . 
they are not different for nothing . 
in speeches , Quebec is recognized as distinct , among other things , because of its civil law , but in reality , this bill does not recognize that fact . 
consequently , I would like to know if the member would be willing to go as far as to support the bill ' s recognizing , because of civil law , that in the objective of regulating electronic commerce and protecting personal information , where there is a civil law system , civil law and its legislation should apply , because these provisions are even in the Quebec civil code , and to give precedence to those provisions . 
governments could then hold discussions to ensure harmonization for businesses involved in interprovincial trade . 
does the hon. member believe that the federal legislation should apply in Quebec and prevent the Quebec government from making regulations under civil law ? 
this is what I am asking the hon. member . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague raises an interesting question . 
this perhaps is one of the ongoing dilemmas we often face when we are trying to introduce a pan - Canadian approach to a problem . 
we recognize that one province abides by a civil code and therefore has different approaches from the rest of the country . 
i would be open to further discussions on this . 
the need to integrate the systems is critical . 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the PC Party of Canada I am pleased to speak to Bill C - 6 , the personal information protection and electronic documents act . 
before I begin I would like to thank many witnesses who took the time to make submissions , either in person or in writing , to the Standing Committee on Industry . 
their representations were extremely helpful with respect to bringing new issues to light . 
i would also like to pay tribute to my colleagues on the industry committee for their vigorous discussion of the contents of the bill , in particular my colleagues from Mercier , L é vis and Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine . 
regardless of our political differences we are all trying to ensure that parliament acts appropriately on legislative matters . 
moreover , I would like to note the efforts of the member for St. Catharines , the former parliamentary secretary to the minister of industry , in terms of his credible defence of the government position . 
i would also like to commend the member for Durham for bringing forward an amendment at committee to section 18 of the bill which was identical to an amendment I had sponsored . 
it is always a rare pleasure to see Liberals deviate from the government line . 
perhaps we will see a day when the chair of the industry committee shows similar courage , but I digress from the subject at hand , Bill C - 6 . 
the intent of Bill C - 6 is a positive one . 
the bill unfortunately has become known as the e - commerce bill , which is a bit of a misnomer . 
part 1 of Bill C - 6 deals with the protection of personal information irrespective of whether it is in an e - commerce environment or whatever . 
meanwhile parts 2 , 3 and 4 of Bill C - 6 pertain specifically to electronic documents . 
for a so - called e - commerce bill , the committee should really have devoted more time to sections pertaining to electronic documents . 
that being said , let us never forget that this is as much a personal privacy law as an e - commerce law . 
the two distinct issues have become intertwined . 
it is the growth of e - commerce that is driving initiatives such as Bill C - 6 . 
as I noted during my remarks on second reading the increase of electronic commerce in Canada and throughout the world , more appropriately North America , is growing exponentially . 
we require a law to carefully examine the extent of government regulations in this domain . 
the European Union has before its member countries a hard hitting directive to require companies to take exhaustive measures to protect the privacy of their customers . 
meanwhile the United States has chosen the route of self - regulation . 
in essence , it is letting companies prove their worth in protecting the personal information of their customers . 
as someone who has spent 28 years working for one of Canada ' s largest high tech companies , with many of those years spent in sales and marketing , I understand the logic of the U.S. approach . 
the private sector has a strong stake in protecting its customers , especially as it relates to the still unrelated realm of e - commerce . 
if customers do not trust a company with their information they will find another company that will . 
competition is therefore a strong motivator for companies to take meaningful measures to protect the information of their customers . 
while I understand the U.S. approach , and I do believe it is the right answer for Canada , I also understand that the U.S. is now beginning the process to develop a privacy and e - commerce act . 
today I listened to the industry minister in the House when he said that we must do something and that people were saying we must do it now . 
i am not saying that the privacy and e - commerce act is not important , but when I look at privacy , at e - commerce and at the consumer or the customer , I think we should have been a lot more transparent . 
we should have had a comprehensive e - commerce privacy act that incorporated all the provinces , more importantly , and made sure that we were in step with our biggest trading partner , the U.S. 
the PC Party and I believe in the need for legislation to protect personal privacy . 
for example , subclause 18 ( 1 ) gives the privacy commissioner the right to audit a company based on a dispute regarding recommended business practices which are listed under schedule 1 of the bill . 
recommended business practices are just that , recommendations . 
they are not laws and should therefore not be enforced as such . 
the privacy commissioner should be allowed to conduct an audit only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the law has been violated . 
audits are intrusive and place a heavy administrative burden on the business operations of Canadian companies . 
the audit power under Bill C - 6 should only be used to cover alleged violations of mandatory obligations set out in the bill . 
the privacy commissioner should not be permitted to micromanage whether a company complies with recommended business practices such as what type of passwords or encryptions are being used by a company . 
subclause 18 ( 1 ) as presently drafted is not necessary since Bill C - 6 already provides the privacy commissioner with the tools needed to ensure the compliance of schedule 1 . 
for example , section 11 allows an individual to file a complaint if he or she feels that an organization is contravening the legislation or not following a recommended business practice . 
furthermore , section 12 gives the privacy commissioner the power to investigate all complaints including complaints that an organization is not following recommended business practices . 
i must also reiterate the longstanding objections of a variety of witnesses to the far - ranging powers granted to the privacy commissioner under clauses 12 and 18 . 
while I do not object to extending search and seizure powers to the privacy commissioner under Bill C - 6 , it is in the best interest of all concerned that his office be required to obtain prior judicial authorization . 
the lack of any obligation for the privacy commissioner to obtain the approval of our courts before exercising certain seizure powers is deeply troubling . 
clauses 12 and 18 of Bill C - 6 create a fundamental conflict by allowing the privacy commissioner to determine whether to exercise search and seizure powers and execute those same powers . 
the authorization should be granted by a neutral third party as in the case of criminal investigations . 
bill C - 6 already provides the privacy commissioner with broad investigative and audit powers . 
the commissioner may summon and enforce appearance of persons under oath , converse with any person , compel the production of documents and receive and accept any evidence in the same manner as the superior court . 
it is for these reasons that additional safeguards are needed in Bill C - 6 as it relates to the privacy commissioner or his delegate actually entering the premises of a private organization and seizing records . 
indeed , Blair Mackenzie of the Canadian Newspaper Association told the industry committee that the provisions within Bill C - 6 are " frightening '' . 
other witnesses have alluded to a challenge under the charter of rights and freedoms if the privacy commissioner acts on clause 12 or 18 . 
furthermore , I am also troubled that the government did not bring forward any study or report on the cost impact of Bill C - 6 . 
from a legal , constitutional and economic standpoint these unfettered audit powers constitute a tremendous defect in the legislation . 
sadly the Liberal majority decided to ignore the fears of free speech advocates and the pleas of the private sector and chose to defeat my amendment to oblige the privacy commissioner to obtain a court order before exercising certain seizure . 
however there are many other problems with the bill which the Liberals chose to ignore . 
as Bill C - 6 is currently drafted there is no provision to facilitate the sharing of personal employee data between management and the union pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement . 
again the Liberal majority defeated my amendments before the industry committee to remove these potential obstacles to the employee - employer relationship . 
moreover , I do not feel that the amendment brought forward by the member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine to clause 27 adequately addresses this problem with the bill . 
the Liberal majority also defeated my amendments to limit the costs charged by an organization for those seeking personal information to the same level of fees charged by government organizations . 
despite the great rhetoric from the Liberals regarding personal privacy , Bill C - 6 leaves the door open to the application of high fees for someone ' s personal information which if not properly regulated could become a barrier to access . 
bill C - 6 also raised the spectre of a new round of federal - provincial battles . 
the governments of Canada ' s two largest provinces , Ontario and Quebec , have spoken loudly and strongly in opposition to Bill C - 6 . 
the industry committee heard from distinguished constitutional lawyers including a former deputy minister of justice . 
they disagreed passionately on whether or not Bill C - 6 intrudes on provincial jurisdiction . 
i found it quite troubling that one of these distinguished experts mentioned the possibility of Bill C - 6 as presently drafted becoming another referendum issue . 
the Liberals had a chance to suspend clause by clause consideration at committee to allow the industry minister to negotiate a possible solution to prevent a constitutional challenge but the Liberals said no . 
they refused to co - operate . 
regrettably the federal Liberals did nothing to address these concerns . 
they seem more interested in provoking fights than finding real solutions . 
anybody who witnessed the partisan Liberal attacks against the Ontario ministry of health bureaucrat would attest to the poor attitude of the Liberals . 
i will give credit where it is due . 
for example , the government supported my amendments to subparagraph 7 ( 3 ) ( h ) ( i ) which would protect personal information for the shorter of 100 years after the record ' s creation or 20 years after the individual ' s death . 
bill C - 6 previously would have allowed for the disclosure only after the shorter of 110 years after the record ' s creation or 20 years after the individual ' s death . 
as amended , this provision of the bill is now a more reasonable balance between protecting the personal information of the living and allowing the use of such information for historical , research or literary purposes . 
this is still a relatively small aspect of Bill C - 6 . 
i thank the government for helping me to get this part of the legislation right . 
i also thank the government for supporting my amendments to remove a clause from the original version of Bill C - 6 which would have allowed the government through order in council to change schedule 1 of the bill . 
regardless of these minor improvements the bill remains fundamentally flawed . 
the PC Party supported Bill C - 6 with the hope that the government would allow the industry committee to correct many of these errors and omissions . 
sadly not enough of these flaws were corrected . 
the bill opens the door to legal battles due to the unfettered power given to the privacy commissioner . 
it unduly restricts the legitimate activities of small and medium size businesses . 
it causes a new restrictive , regulatory framework without a cost impact study . 
it aggravates the delicate relationship between the federal government and the Ontario and Quebec governments . 
it rushes headlong into meeting an European Union directive when our number one e - commerce and overall trading partner has adopted a position with the directly opposite approach . 
i have tried to be constructive and I have tried to improve the bill at committee , but by and large the Liberals have refused to co - operate . 
they have refused to compromise . 
without concrete evidence they ask us to trust them that all the problems will sort themselves out . 
on behalf of the PC Party I oppose Bill C - 6 and urge the government to respect and act upon the differing points of view raised by so many in opposition to the bill as it is currently written . 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very important for me to speak on Bill C - 6 . 
i want to indicate that I will be using the whole 20 minutes that I am entitled to . 
bill C - 6 is very important to me . 
as our NDP colleague pointed out , the protection of personal information in the private sector , what with the technological progress being made , must be regulated if we are to protect our fellow citizens from coast to coast . 
what is the purpose of Bill C - 6 ? 
first , part 1 of the bill will ensure the protection of personal information collected , used and disclosed by the private sector . 
however , these laws do not affect the private sector . 
up until now , Quebec was the only province to have a law protecting personal information , which applied and still applies to the private sector . 
first , I want to talk about this bill and the protection it will afford all Canadians , and then I will address the concerns raised by my hon. colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois . 
how will this bill protect personal information ? 
first of all , " personal information " means information about an identifiable individual . 
this includes but is not limited to the following information : race , ethnic origin , colour , age , marital status , religion , level of education , medical record , criminal , financial or employment information , address , telephone number , numerical identification codes such as social insurance number , fingerprints , blood type , tissue or other biological samples , personal opinions or viewpoints . 
this is a broad list , and I did not cover all personal information that could identify a person . 
this bill is designed to protect this type of information by requiring organizations to respect the obligations set out in the model code for the protection of personal information prepared by the Canadian Standards Association , or CSA . 
the code is entrenched in the bill , which I hope will be passed . 
this means that it will have force of law as schedule 1 of the law . 
so where and when will this bill apply ? 
once it is passed , this bill will apply to any organization which collects , uses or discloses personal information in the course of commercial activities . 
commercial activity means any activity that is of a commercial nature , which includes selling and buying as well as other activities such as barter and exchange transactions . 
what is an organization ? 
an organization can be a business , an association , a partnership , a person or a trade union , for example . 
to facilitate the harmonization of provincial and federal legislation on the protection of personal information , the coming into force of this bill will take place gradually . 
after a one - year transition period , the bill will apply to private sector fields , and I repeat to private sector fields , subjected to federal regulatory control . 
but what are the private sector fields that are subjected to federal regulatory control ? 
that is described in the Canadian Constitution . 
some areas are strictly of provincial jurisdiction whereas others are strictly of federal jurisdiction . 
others yet are mixed . 
those fields that are subjected to federal regulatory control are : telecommunications , radiobroadcasting , banks and interprovincial transports , as far as the protection of personal information from clients and employees is concerned . 
this bill will also apply to agencies that share personal information outside the provincial or national borders . 
i will say it again because I want to make sure that my colleagues from the other side of the House fully understand this notion . 
this bill will also apply to the agencies that share personal information outside the provincial or national borders , for example credit assessment officers and some insurance companies . 
as all of us in the House today know , and as many Canadians and Quebecers know , Quebec has had such legislation since 1994 . 
i would like to address a few concerns raised by Bloc Quebecois members . 
first , the fact that , in their view , there is no need for this bill in Quebec . 
we have been told several times that the Barreau du Qu é bec , of which I am a member , the Chambre des notaires , and other professional bodies and societies made their positions known on Bill C - 6 . 
i am sure that the Barreau du Qu é bec did not claim that the personal information of a non - resident of Quebec that is disclosed or exchanged outside the borders of Quebec would be protected by the provincial law . 
the provincial law is clear : its purpose is to protect the personal information of Quebecers when this information leaves Quebec ' s borders . 
the law is silent about the personal information of non - residents of Quebec that is collected in Quebec and disclosed or transferred outside Quebec . 
the need exists . 
i am speaking to Quebecers throughout the province , whether they live in Sept - Î les , Chicoutimi , Ville - Marie , Shawville , Bedford , Montreal , Lachine , Saint - Lambert , Ch â teauguay , Charny , L é vis , Charlesbourg or Sillery . 
it is a wonderful piece of legislation , but it is not perfect . 
i could mention whistle blowing . 
i will get back later to this form of safeguard , which exists in Bill C - 6 and not in Quebec ' s legislation . 
there is a need in Quebec and not just in the other provinces . 
i am sorry , but the need exists from sea to sea in Canada , including in Quebec . 
the first thing the court will say is that the Quebec law does not apply to that company . 
bill C - 6 is needed to ensure the protection of personal information about all the Quebecers and all the people who are not necessarily Quebec residents but who were in Quebec at the time the information disclosed outside Quebec was collected . 
it was suggested that provincial areas of jurisdiction are invaded . 
i invite my colleagues to go attend a course on constitutional law . 
that is a well known subject . 
here we have a federal system and our constitution has set some areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction . 
some other areas are under exclusive provincial jurisdiction and a third category of areas is under joint jurisdiction . 
when dealing with the commercial sector , I regret to have to tell my honourable colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois that commerce is an area coming under federal jurisdiction also . 
when a company carries on commercial activities outside Quebec , that is interprovincial or international , we are getting into an area of federal jurisdiction . 
you can laugh - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
the hon. member knows very well that she must address the Chair and not the other members . 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings : 
you are right , Mr. Speaker , and I apologize . 
i must always address you , and I must never address the people across the way . 
i was talking about infringement of provincial jurisdictions . 
i again invite our colleagues seated to your left and my right to perhaps take constitutional law 101 to find out about federal jurisdictions , provincial jurisdictions and joint jurisdictions . 
an hon. member : 
oh , oh . 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings : 
on the other side of the House they are saying that I did not invent the term . 
the activities of the organizations I just mentioned come under federal jurisdiction . 
they also say there was no consultation . 
i am quite surprised to hear it claimed in the House today that there was no consultation with the provinces and with those interested in the whole issue of protecting privacy and personal information . 
the very members claiming there was no consultation are saying that the Barreau du Qu é bec was consulted along with the Chambre des notaires . 
there is some confusion in their minds , to say the least . 
there were consultations between governments , which led to one excellent thing : almost all the governments , if not all the governments in Canada , recognized the need for legislation to protect personal information . 
however , not all these provincial governments had time enough to pass legislation . 
British Columbia is preparing to pass legislation . 
but , Bill C - 6 addresses this problem , and as I mentioned at the start of my remarks , it is precisely in order to permit the provinces to pass legislation that may be implemented progressively . 
at the end of three years , if some provincial or territorial governments have yet to pass legislation to protect personal information , the federal law will continue to apply in all areas of commercial activity in the private sector . 
however , in the case of governments passing legislation that is essentially the same , the organizations covered by provincial legislation will be exempted from the application of the federal legislation . 
i will close on this . 
about the claim that Quebec is best protected , I must tell you that , if - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sorry but the 20 minutes are up . 
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T é miscamingue , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I was anxious to have an exchange of views with the Liberal member on this . 
the fact that the Quebec bar association or the Conseil du Patronat spoke out in committee does not mean that the Government of Quebec was consulted . 
there is a difference between the Quebec bar association , the Conseil du Patronat , the CSN and the government . 
the government is a different institution , one elected democratically by the people and representing Quebecers . 
that is my first point . 
second , she says we were wrong when we said that this was a provincial jurisdiction . 
but the protection of personal information is based on provincial jurisdiction over property , under the civil code . 
i would imagine that a nice little discussion between bar association colleagues will ensue , since it is the association ' s opinion that this is an area of provincial jurisdiction . 
i quote : 
this means that a considerable number of companies established in Quebec will from now on be subject to the federal legislation rather than the Quebec legislation , and this is not likely to make it any easier for members of the public seeking to find out what their rights are in this context of changing legislation . 
as well , Quebec - based businesses will be required to master a new system for the protection of personal information , one which differs considerably from the one in place in Quebec . 
i now come to the recommendation made by the Quebec bar , which supports that of the access to information commission and which provides that : 
to avoid any confusion and ensure that Quebecers can continue to benefit from a comprehensive personal information protection program , we submit that Bill C - 54 - now Bill C - 6 - should be amended to provide expressly that the federal legislation will not apply to businesses governed by the Privacy Act in the private sector . 
i can already see the hon. member getting ready to say " Yes , but what about those for whom that act would not apply ? " 
her friends from the bar added : 
" we go even further . 
in our opinion , the bill should incorporate by reference the Quebec legislation , even in areas of federal jurisdiction , to avoid confusion , overlap and duplication in the legislation applied in Quebec '' . 
but this government will never recognize the primacy of the Quebec law , even if it concerns the civil code , which makes us so distinct in the eyes of the federal government . 
when the federal government defines Quebec ' s distinctive character , it usually points to two or three elements . 
the government includes as few elements as possible , but it usually mentions the civil code . 
yet , with this legislation , it is not even prepared to recognize the civil code . 
so , what does the member have to say to the Barreau ? 
not to us on this side , to the members across the way to her right and to your left , Mr. Speaker . 
what does she have to say to the Barreau du Qu é bec , which is suggesting this should be the solution ? 
and , before concluding , I would like to come back to one point . 
she says : " Yes , but we will not be able to regulate out - of - province companies doing business in Quebec '' . 
if that logic applied , how is the Government of Canada going to be able to regulate an American company doing business in Canada ? 
using her logic , it could not , because she is saying that Quebec ' s legislation does not apply to a company holding information obtained in Quebec , if the company is based outside Quebec . 
there is something a bit illogical about what she is saying and I would like her to explain to me why she thinks Quebec cannot fully legislate this situation when , if this were true , the same logic would apply to Canada , which would be able to legislate in respect of American companies . 
i would like her to explain this and to respond to the brief from the Barreau that I have just cited and which is very specific . 
if she wishes , I can give her a copy of the document . 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his remarks . 
the federal bill will be completing the protection afforded consumers in Quebec by the legislation of that province . 
both laws deal with different activities , and the federal legislation will be filling the gaps in the protection given by the Quebec law . 
in Quebec , the federal legislation will target situations where the activities of an organization are not regulated by the Commission d ' acc è s à l ' information . 
i can think for example of companies under federal jurisdiction , and of the problems Quebecers can encounter in their dealings with companies outside their province . 
bill C - 6 settles problems that cannot be handled through provincial laws , even when these laws have been prepared with great care . 
when data are transferred across the borders of 13 provinces or territories , the Privacy Commissioner of Canada is in a better position to investigate and settle cross border problems . 
a second example would be the case of a company headquartered in Alberta collecting information on Quebec consumers . 
since Alberta and Quebec are not bound by each other ' s legislation , there is a need for federal legislation . 
Quebec businesses that transfer personal information within Quebec and between provinces will have no problem complying with both laws . 
they are obeying industrial safety legislation as well as legislation governing their commercial activities . 
Quebec businesses have already had to organise their commercial activities in compliance with different laws , federal as well as provincial . 
it is a shame to claim that our businesses are not capable of doing that . 
bill C - 6 and Quebec Law - 68 may be drafted differently but their intent and impact are rather similar . 
both pieces of legislation require businesses to obtain the consent of a person before collecting , using or disclosing his or her personal information . 
both pieces of legislation give people access to their personal information that is maintained by private sector organisations . 
both provide for monitoring by a privacy commissioner and allow redress mechanisms for people whose rights are affected . 
above all , both provide for rights and obligations which are basically similar , since both have the same starting point . 
what is that starting point ? 
it all started with the guidelines established by the OCDE in 1980 . 
sure , there are differences , but Canada can manage them . 
canada may be the only country in the whole world which provides in its charter of rights and freedoms that it shall promote its diversity . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C - 6 , an act aimed at promoting electronic commerce at the expense of privacy . 
since the beginning of the week , I have noticed that the Liberal government opposite , with Bill C - 6 and Bill C - 3 , an act in respect of criminal justice for young persons , has been speaking from both sides of its mouth . 
the government tells Quebec and the rest of Canada : " We are going to talk with the provinces , we will come to an agreement before introducing new bills . " 
i am really disillusioned with this government ' s double talk . 
i believe Quebecers and Canadians must realize that this government ignores everything that moves both in Quebec and the rest of Canada . 
this is the general image we have had of this government for the two years we have been sitting in the Parliament of Canada . 
do not tell me it is because I am a sovereignist , an independentist or a separatist that I talk this way . 
i am defending the interests of a francophone riding in Quebec , the riding of Jonqui è re . When I travel through my riding , my constituents tell me this about the current government : " What is wrong with them , why do they want to re - invent the wheel , redo what has already been done , and why do they not take the best in other laws to improve the justice system and health care system in Canada ? " 
no , what they want is to re - invent the wheel . 
too much is too much , or not enough is not enough , but I think the government has time to waste , because it has no vision for the next millennium that is fast approaching . 
i think the government doe not know hoe to go forward . 
it wants to relive the past , to return to the time where it was not in power , to give itself good conscience . 
we have a concrete example of that with this Bill C - 6 . 
Quebec is the only state in North America that has a legislation to protect personal information in the private sector . 
i hope the minister noticed that we have a legislation in Quebec . 
of course , nothing is perfect , and I think we can rewrite a legislation to improve it , because time goes by and society is evolving . 
he could have looked at this legislation and say : " Quebec did this , why not do the same for the other provinces of Canada , and also cover other areas that the Quebec legislation does not cover ? " 
what did the Minister of Industry do ? 
he told us he had consulted with the provinces . 
i could give you some evidence that the Minister of Industry did not consult with the provinces , because on September 21 , 1998 , the federal minister sent a legislation proposal to his provincial counterparts . 
he asked for their comments . 
on October 1 , 1998 , he said : " I do not need the views of my counterparts , I will act unilaterally , I will table a bill in the House '' . 
on October 30 , the 12 provincial and territorial justice ministers unanimously called - I am not sure if the word " unanimously " has the same meaning in English as in French , but this word means that everyone was in agreement - on the federal Minister of Industry to withdraw Bill C - 54 , because it was " a major intrusion into provincial and territorial areas of jurisdiction '' . 
this can be found in a press release that followed that federal - provincial - territorial meeting of the justice ministers , held on October 30 , 1998 , in Regina , Saskatchewan . 
these are the facts . 
the government brags about consulting the provinces . 
is this the meaning they give to the word " consultation '' ? 
i am curious as to what dictionary they might be using . 
to consult people is to sit down with them , to submit your projects and to ask them for their opinion . 
that is what consulting is all about . 
if you hear about some legislation somewhere that is protecting privacy and working just fine , you sit down , negotiate and take the best of this legislation to try and make a society , a country like Canada a leader in that field to ensure the best protection for its citizens . 
this morning , my hon. colleague from T é miscamingue made an eloquent speech in which he gave a clear explanation of privacy . 
personally , I would not like for someone , anyone , to scrutinize my every move and say : " Maybe she should have done this instead of that . 
did the Minister of Industry understand ? 
the Minister of Industry created a whole constitutional litigation that could have been avoided had he agreed to work in co - operation with its counterparts . 
if Bill C - 6 is implemented in Quebec , the rights of Quebecers regarding personal information protection will suffer significant setbacks regarding consent and remedies . 
the member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine says she is a legal expert . 
there are several legal experts in my family . 
we see more and more shortfalls in the legislation passed in the House of Commons . 
i think there are many shortfalls in Bill C - 6 . 
we must not let these legal experts implement legislation as they like . 
in all conscience , we must ensure that these bills help our fellow citizens , not the legal experts . 
there is also a setback regarding the collection of information from a third party . 
moreover , the Bill will be confusing for companies and individuals in Quebec . 
the implementation of Bill C - 6 in Quebec will require the setting up of two systems for the protection of personal information and it will be confusing for companies and individuals . 
when there is confusion there is a need for interpretation . 
i call upon the minister of Industry to exclude Quebec from his bill . 
we , in Quebec - and I believe that some people in the House will laugh - are pioneers in privacy protection . 
the Quebec charter of rights and freedoms allowed our legislators to be at the forefront of privacy protection . 
far from me the idea of pretending that we are perfect , but I can say that we have always been listening to our fellow citizens to be able to take care of their wellbeing and to answer their needs through our charter of rights and freedoms . 
we are constantly listening to people to improve our legislation . 
bill C - 6 does not improve on Quebec legislation , it will diminish it . 
we did it and the privacy protection act we passed is based on our civil code . 
i will not repeat everything that was said by my colleagues , the member for T é miscamingue and the member for Mercier , but through you , Mr. Speaker , I want to ask the Minister of Industry - it is never too late to recognize one ' s mistake - to change his mind before it is too late . 
i am waiting for an answer from the Minister of Industry and I am putting a lot of energy into this to make sure that my request gets to him through you , Mr. Speaker . 
the Deputy Speaker :
