\section{Introduction}
%we translated using IBM models 1 & 2
%mention shortcomings of these models (such as the "ook -> as well" example, where translation can't happen both ways (should be confirmed though, maybe we're making an oversight))
%we made some improvements

\section{Model}
%short summary IBM 1 \& 2
%describe choice and implementation of each improvement

\section{Experiments}
%mention data (train set, test set) #NOTE: test set is not yet provided to us, still greyed out on website. If we never get any, we'll have to split the train data
%mention both models will be described separately

\subsection{IBM model1}
%EM on train set
%improvements on IBM model 1
%Viterbi alignments (= most likely alignments, argmax a) and computing AER (yet to be provided)

\subsection{IBM model 2}
%optimisation with different model parameters: (NOTE: literally from the project description)
% - uniform init
% - random init (THREE times)
% - initialising lexical parameters with results from IBM model 1 (=unique words recognised)
% compute AER again and compare with IBM model 1

\section{Results}
%mention both models will be described separately

\subsection{IBM model 1}
% log likelihood change over iterations plot
%"In your report, you should also consider the limitations of Model 1 as described by Moore (2004), and find examples in your output to illustrate these limitations."
%viterbi alignments & AER results

\subsection{IBM model 2}
% for all FIVE parameter initializations (five because random is run three times), plot log likelihood growth over iterations
% AER results, compare with IBM model 1 results

\section{Conclusion}
% likely points of interest:
% - model 2 will (should) outperform model 1
% - improvements on model 1
% - initialising model 2 with model 1's lexical types is likely to outperform the uniform/random initialisation
